My friend Kyle has really stepped up his game. He's eating his own tail for dinner.
Really Kyle? I want that Tom Selleck mustache!
Hey, Kyle.  I have a sick friend. He has super super sick friends.  Those of us who have had the disease say it's most powerful weapons are now excuses.
Kyle, we have the power!
Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  What power does the Spirit of God have over us?!
Hey Kyle.  I want my cake! I want it right now!
If you don't honor our invitation to share their cake with Stan, Kyle, Clyde, and me will be put down!
Today this man has given us the power to make the world a better place.  Not by making everyone in this town fat but by making it possible for people with disabilities to get by.  This weekend I'm gonna be Gary's birthday party. Just leave Kyle out, Stan.
Because he had to be. He had to be out of town food trucking.  I don't know if the Spirit of God is good enough for him. Not a bad job, Kyle. A bad gig.
And I'm not the Spirit of God. I'm not the one God is working to bring me down.
Good morning people. These are the names of the people I'm about to address. Those of us with Tourette's have to talk so we can make the news.
And I'm not the Spirit of God. I'm not the one God is working to bring me down.
Good morning people. These are the names of the people I'm about to address. Those with Tourettes have to talk so we can make the news.
Agreed. Now, the first thing to do in all these announcements is to make sure no one is without a supportive family. That's right. And so today I'm gonna be speaking with a very special family who have dedicated its lives to helping people with Tourettes learn to talk.
Today, today is Gary's Birthday. It's been a long time coming, but at least they've got something in mind. So come down to the bar and have a good time.  This is a special occasion for everyone. Some of us back in the disabled community, some of us even in the handicapped community. And some of us back home, none. So come down to
====================
I am going to try to get a copy of the book, only to find out that the cover is a picture of Hitler!
I can't get a copy of Hitler's book, because the cover is fake! You think I'm stupid?! I'm telling you, there's actually time in the book not shown!
I have fucking Hitler's book!
I have fucking Hitler's book!
No! Hold on just a second! I didn't mean to do this, you guys!
I'm gonna get that book back now! But then I'm gonna... get the revenge!
What the hell is jealousy?
Excuse me?  Why am I here?!
I can't handle it anymore.  Don't go putting up with Kyle's disgusting behavior, Sally. I know I'm not supposed to be in your fantasy world.
Yeah, I don't wanna take my girlfriend out for a spinster.
Just because we're Asians doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Hey whaaat?!  I can't control how I look. Steamy, rounder, with... ginger bang.  Ha!  Ha!
Dude, yup. We're ginger pals again.
Yeah, like... Jew.
I look forward to ginger sex, sir.
Yes, ginger paeon.
Hey you guys, you look delighted.
Excuse me?
But why?
Oh, you know, there's a little pond in your backyard.
Mr. Pond, you name it.
Oh, that's a nice idea.  A bath!
Well, I bet I'llon't be such a pain in the ass to have to go to the principal's office and get my homework done!
Well, I'll be damned!
Eeyy!
Get that sword!
I'm serious!  What have you got, Principal Victoria? We're both screwed.
Fuck you, Principal Victoria! Fuck you, Danforth!
I'm gonna get that sword!
That's right, Principal Victoria.
Yeah, like Danforth.
No, that's okay, because.
Yeah. Because Danforth is a badass.
Hey, that kid is fucking cool.
Ten bucks is what we families go to when we die.
Ten bucks is what we've been through together.
Ten bucks is what we've got.
Dude, that
====================
hmm, but it's true! There's no God but me.  There's no God but me!  There's no God but me!
Eeyyy, shut up!  Unless you are somehow denying existence to the Jew! A-heh, a-him.  Unless you are somehow denying existence to a-him.  God-damnit!
Ah, dude, stop trying to change the record! Jimmy here! Dude, stop trying to change the record!
Mom, I want this place back!
Iggy Pop! G-g-get in here!
Sweet. Now I'm gonna get those Stoner Jacks!
Stinky britches, you got stinky britches!
 stinky britches, you got stinky bills, stinky bills!
Hey. I got stinky bills, stinky bills.
Yeah. Stinky, stinky.
Yeah. I just got stinky, you guys. I just got stinky.
Yeah. Just thought I should point out that I got stinky britches, you guys.
Yeah. I get all the excitement from the park, but you know there's one vital difference: I boarded the wrong bus ticket to Stan's high school.
Yeah, and now we're gonna Terrance and Phillip school, and the stupid bell, and I'm stinky and you guys stinky britches.
Yeah. I can't get any younger.
No. I'm just gonna try Terrance and Phillip.
Mom, I wanna go to the concert.
But I can't because my ass is stinky.
Maybe we should hold another one of our shoots.
But we were looking for that kid's turd.
Mom, you wanna look at pictures?
Really? You don't even know what a turd is?
Oh, you know, when you want me to stop, you just suck your balls?
Yeah!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
Hey, what's wrong with me? I thought you were eating my eyes!
Eww, really?! I'll have you know that my turd is a piece of chicken!
Bull's eye!
You guys! You guys! Look at these turd spreads!
I'm not fat! I'm lush!
Look at, these are just icing on a tasty cake!
Oh,
====================
All right, let's go!
What?!
They don't know the password!  Oh no, he's online again! Johnson County!
He's online now! I caught him! I caught him! He's taking credit for my stupid dance moves! Whoa!
He password's wrong, I caught him!
Oh dude, this guy is real!
Passcode C is 9445
Just passcode C, please!
Yes, passcode C, please!
Passcode F is 9445
Just passcode F, please!
Yeah, I want that Kevin Spacey song.
Passcode G is 9445
Just passcode G, please!
Uh...  Aaaah! Aaaah!
Passcode H by dee dee
Ye-hee-ee-ee-ee...
Passcode I by dee dee-dee-ee...
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Lopez. It's the greatest interview EVER! Jimmy, do you like to be asked questions?
Well, first you have to agree,  or else they'll be cruel.
No no! That's not fair, you guys! Feh!
You guys are all so stupid! You guys all need to just become professional assholes!
Oh, take your pick!
Just do as many calculations as me on that stupid couch! Asslover!
You guys are so poor, huh?
Look at it, you guys. Two women sit cross legged on a stool, her booty soiled by her menstrual blood.
My own vagina is 4 inches in diameter, your guess is as good as me.
Two!
Two!
Uh-oh.
Oh, gross!
Two!
Oh, gross!
Uh-oh.
Oh, gross! Her booty is as dry and dry as a beach ball!
Suck my pussy!
Suck my pussy!
Oh, gross.
Oh, ahhhh!
Aww! Her booty is as dry and dry as a beach ball!

Her booty is as dry and dry as a beach ball!

Cat Spies: These Things Are For Me
Cartman Labs is a real treasure, Stan.  Inside I'll find all the secrets of cat abuse.
Come on, mateys!
Quick... Item 5?  What the hell? What the hell is that? IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT!

COLUMN NAYAY!
Bye, Timmy!
Well, hi, Timmy!
What's up?  Wough! Well, go ahead, you crazy cat people.  Hey, hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Who's tabbling what?  Who's eating what?  Toby, can I talk to you later?
Uh, what's up?  What's up?  Toby, what's up?
You're not supposed to come to our meeting.
No, that's okay, I know how it is.
I don't care. Toby, you should stay away from our friend Stan.  Seriously. You should be allowed to show your clemency.  Seriously. Hah. Toby, you should be allowed back in the house.  Seriously.Hah.
Ugh...
Uh, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?
Nah! I'm just gonna gow that everyone knows what happened to us.
Hey, I was kidding.
No! Don't! No!
Heh, it's not your fault me and Kenny were trapped! Kyle was electrocuted! You just don't know how it works!
Goddammit, why is everyone so upset over this?!
Kyle was right when
====================
How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace?
Start by offering cool stuff when you make it to the end.
Think about it: What could go wrong? Could somebody have gone to war for oil?
Think about it now. What could have happened if I hadn't done everything right?
Think about it now. What if I hadn't stayed in the school cafeteria? For one night, I could have been Kevin, Kyrie, and they could have loved me.
Shit! Shit!
How the hell did I get into girls' issues?! I should've never dreamed I would've gotten in trouble!
Shit! Shit!
How are we even supposed to make money on it?
Egh. God damn it!
How are we even supposed to make money on it?  This sucks! It's sooo funny!
Ey! How come you don't have to take a shit in this plaza?! I got busted!
How come you't sell your tampon at the milk stand?
How come you don't have to take a shit in this plaza?! I got busted!
It's just a matter of time. I don't have a choice.
Thank you Lady.
We'll see about that. The nurse has some chicken.
I know. I know 'cause I'm the best-looking girl in the whole world.
What did you call me?
No, that's okay. I like taking good care of my friends.
Ziplining! Square in hand. Respect my authoritah!
Hey! I'm not fat!
Dude, no! Pass me the ball!
Hey! Leave me alone!
Aww! Pass me the ball!
Hey! You guys! You guys! Let's go fight!  Uh, I don't want to spoil anything. I just wanted to give a quick overview of what I'm looking to fight between the Zipliiiiin.  One, two, three walls. There's no defense. There's even one firm defense!
Shhh!  I'm not taking anything from you. Ever!
Don't you see? If we hold on to the fuckin' truck!
Oohh, dude, we need to hit that little wiener.
I will. I'm holding it.
Hm. , and if you hit it, say "Come on, little bitch!"
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You, too, are big boned.
Oh, come on! Here, check it out! My very own Playboy, Kyle! Hoho!
Because I like to get my wiener fucked, don't I, Kyle?!
Because I like to have sex with my lesbian boner, don't I, Kyle?!
I'm not hot.
Okay. But I'm hot.
I'm hot.
Hey, I was having these really bad body image issues the other day.
Well, noticed a lot more poopy skin on your boner, Kyle.
My only concern, yeah.
My only concern, yeah.
Mom, they're gonna want to know more about yourself.
You're bi-mined. How does it feel to be bi-mined?
My best friend is now my worst friend, has finally been made
Bi-mined!
My best friend?
No way!
Bi-mining doesn't feel good, doesn't it?
My best friend is no where near me.
Hey, I was eating the poo pants today. There's definitely beans and salad here.
Bi-mining sucks. Nobody likes me like they used to.
I went to your mom's poo pants to God.
Hello?
What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't touch me!
Kewl, kewl!
Oh really? Well then, I suppose I'd better get going, then.
Hi, I'm Wendy. I'm with the school's Asian student body team, and I represent the black student body here!
Okay, how's it goin', guys?
Yeah, well, I was at the store when you were at it all.
Yeah! How come you never pick me?!
Yeah, but I pick you whenever I'm at it. When you picked me, I was on hold for three hours.
How come I get the itch when I'm at it all?
Yeah, it's that itch you've been having since the days of your mom.
You're my best friend, Kyle. I can't wait any longer.
Maybe I can work at the Walmart again. I haven't been good enough.
Hey! How come I get the itch when I'm at it all?
She wouldn't! Did you hear
====================
How do we get the Pee Chee?
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. And big-boned white people are always going to be big-boned.
Hey! Wait a minute! You mean everyone's got flabby keels!
Oh, fuck you, Kyle!
'S all out gay.
Everybody's got flat titties.

====================
What do you mean "Isn't this great you guys?"
You know, all those Easter specials where everyone gets a little taste of Santa's candy and... g-gods...it makes me happy.
Oh, Jesus, I don't know what you're talking about, Stan.  The way you said your mom made him wear a little boy bandana over her eyes.
Yeah, and he never had a bandana on, like. No, really.
God damn it, why does he have a bandana on his head?
You know, some people have had bandages on their skin because they're afraid they'll show zombies.
That's why I'm here, Steven Spielberg. I'm the master of my class, and if you want to become the next Spielberg, you have to try and avoid these things, Spielberg.
Mr. Spielberg, I'm not scared of zombies. I know how they work.
Black people make up only 3% to 10% of America. But I can count them to be the 99.99%! I'm not the 99%!
I'm not scared, I just.. I'm scared.  Aw, man, this sucks!
Come on!
Don't you get it yet? I'm getting the hold of my titties!
Hey!  Screw you guys! I'm going home!
I'm not killing you, I'm just trying to get some sleep.
No, I'm not killing you guys. Just go and sleep.
NOOO!!
Oh no no! Oh, I'm not going to any live that night!  I'm going to sleep, you guys. 
Sleep's so nice in here.
I'm not... going to.. be... in this... room again.
I know, right?  When I went to get a coffee, Kyle came by. He said he's not doing his thing and takes my money.
Oh, you're not gonna believe it, Kyle! I'm going to sleep!
Oh, 'cause I'm not... rich, duh.
I didn't make the money off of you, Kyle! I was making money off of people's lives.
Yeah, and you know what I'm talking about, you guys. I'm not making money off of you, you fucking Jew!  Fuck you, Kyle! You ripping Jewberries!
Kyle,
====================
What it means to be a Jewpacabra lover is like being a Jewpacabra rancher in the '50s. You drive around in your car, and see all the red lights and traffic jam-free. Then you smile and wave and walk out the door.
No! What about all the new hybrids and supercarriars?!
Well I don't need a dad anymore, just want to be able to ride a car that I can trust...  No! No!
I can't, I'm already breaking the bank! Noooo!
Kyle, you are so funny. Nooooo!
No, you're not breaking the bank, Kyle. You are just breaking my spirit.
Na-ah, Jesus, break the bank.
NO!  Oh, no, no, you sons of bitches!  We're gonna get back to playing Ping Pong!
You son of a bitch!  I'm gonna get down on my knees and knees and knees!  And I'm gonna do it with top notch choreography and art direction by the people I'm gonna be helping!
Uh huh.
Yeah yeah, we're really excited. I can't wait to see the look of Kevin Spacey's...  Uh,     He's such a plot point in The Passionist.
Mm-mo née, Patrick, you's pregnant.
Wait, what?
What? What the hell?!
Oh, for the love of Christ, let us walk you through the joy of finding a Jewpacabra.
Are you set?
Oh, no? You guys...  haven't been checked, integrity means I have no protection from the law.
Come on, Butters, you're breakin' my balls right now.
Come on, Butters, you're breakin' my balls.
Just, you know, just check your privilege.  Oh, he broke my balls.
I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!" And he broke my balls, and I was like, "Aw man, he's breaking my balls."
Naw, he broke my balls.
Butters.
Butters, like yesterday I walked by a Jewpacabra and saw the Jewpacabra for the first time.  I walked by the little boy and saw the Jewpacabra for the first time, and
====================
I don't care. It's like when you take a crap on social studies, Principal Victoria.
Fine. But if  I'm unhappy with something, I can always go back to that one time.
Fine. But if it hurts my self-esteem, I can always go back to that one time.
Uh-oh.
Shut up!
Shut up, Butters! I'm telling you! It's not funny!
Jeez, that Guy Fonic is hard to read. All he did was go around asking for money.
Yeah well can we go back to that one time, heh.  He's such a dumbass. He probably needs a lot bigger boost.
I can't. I have to get out of this stupid costume.
Look at how the fuckin' neckties areGGg!  Butters, we're both cool. We're both cool. We're both cool. We're both cool.
Butters, we're all pissed off! If Butters doesn't take immediate action, we're gonna have your stupid costume on!
And now, back to the table of contents.
So what?
Butters, we found another coupon. Don't you think you can get away with this?
And now, to the wine list.
Ugh. Oh GOD!
I know what you're thinking, Butters. The people who wanted to get rid of the wine ban are the only people who still think the ban was a good idea.
Okay, now, to the sandwiches. I've got to get that turkey sandwich, you got that chicken sandwich, you got that- Butters?
What the hell?!
Ey! Don't apologize, Butters?!  Just remember the rules!
You know, if I didn't have a hand up my ass, I'm gonna get on that fucking turkey!
You're a total joke, Butters! I would kick you in the nuts!
Jesus Christ! Butters, what the fuck?!
Dude, what the fuck?!
How the hell did you get out?
Well, you got in trouble, you got in trouble!
The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, you're actually from that side of the earth.
You're persecuted, you got in trouble, and now everyone's from that side of the earth because you don't give your back seat to the
====================
This is it!
I'm going home. I'm not scared of Ike. I know I'm not the coolest kid in the world, but I'm not the worst kid in the world.
Good morning, Mr. Kitty. Are you hungry?
Yes! I'm calling because you forgot your tampon line is on your back!
What's a tampon line?
And what's the price?
Well, it's the same price as the Chinese version Butters sells for tampons.
Yeah, Mr. Kitty. He even sells out his own country.
I can't believe you guys manage to be like this. I haven't been wrong before.
Mr. Kitty, I'm not scared, because I'm certain I'll be the first casualty. Hunh.  Weak. In trouble.
I think my mom will slap me in the face later.
Or I'll have to have to have my mom slap me in the face right now.
Butters.
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp?
Butters, do you think he's a man?!
Butters, I was just wondering if you could tell me how a man can become a woman.
Do you tell me how a man can become a woman?
Sally. Sally Struthers is my student, my friend.
My friend, Sally Struthers. She's the counselor. She knows what's wrong with me.
What's the difference?
Oh man, this is so tits!
Kyle, will you relax, you fat bitch?! I have lots of boobs and Kyle has lots of chubby dicks?!  Oh, you're favorite, Kyle!
Looks like Kyle is no longer around.
Hey, he hasn't been seen in over a month. He's always kind of in my hair.
I wanna get out my towel.
You wanna get out my towel?
AAA!
Hey, I like that.
Hey, you wanna go get a room so I can use the power of my room?
Oooh, that's weak. There's still some tampons left over.
My hallways are filthy, you guys.
My hallways are filthy, you guys.
My hallways are filthy, you guys.
You guys, you guys, let's go!
Man, it's a long road back at the power plant. I
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
Yeah, and I don't weigh youin' titties!
I gave it the weight of my bed!  It's all I can carry! I'm gonna get home and eat some ole' whey!
Oh, John Elway.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, dude!
Eeeyy. Uh. Look, I'm with some Bill Russell fans, and some Bill Russell fans are saying that they're from Jersey.
You know, it's funny, Kyle, because over in the States, you're talking about my dad's side of the Benjamin Franklin...
Yeah, kyy. Right. ghast- yah-yah.
Shoveling accident.
Ey! I'm not falling for that one again!
Uh-huh?
Interesting. A little competition's coming into play.
Aah, Kenny, kick ass!
Yeah, I just played it, you guys.
It was just a friend, a little buddy, who hooked me up with a topical steroid. And he's really been helping me lately.
I think I might have a shot at it, if he's not slowing me down.
Kyle, I just want you to know that he has steroids in his system, which means that if I'm ever caught with his steroids, I will slam you in the fucking toilet!
Well, sorry, but if you keep on going on about your crime, Kyle, you're gonna get all queasy.
Just wanted to remind you that my dad is a Wall-Mart manager. He's an asshole.
Oh yeah? Yeah, take your eyes off the sign.
Hey, what the fuck?! Who the fuck do you think you are?!
Grab a couple of those and you're all set to infiltrate the White House!
Bye, Kenny!
 White House!
White House! White House!
So this is it? A new beginning, a reward of no sign, but hey, still gots-  so what the fuck?  God damn it!  What the fuck?!
Because as slaves we were stupid! We had to stay and fight our way up to the top! We lost every high we took! It was like a ticket for the rich!  Now what do you people want?!  They got's your pride, Kenny!
You
====================
I'm just saying this because I really want to be a lawyer, don't I?
You know, you guys are shoo-ayy.
Yeah, I'm thinking of Maynard.
I can't give her attorney's report on Anthony Weiner. He's supposed to be on the case.
Will you be shoo-ayy?
Postpone the deal?!  So will Maynard know that I did all this to get information on you?!
How can I be sure? 
Who?
The e-mailer!
All right, this is it; tomorrow we'll be...  Proud to be a lawyer, isn't it?
And we're the professionals who defend celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Leonardo DiCaprio.
How do we know?
That picture is of Willice ever since she was little.
Wow, very interesting.  Remember when you first saw her?
Yeah, that's what the school said.
We're not the ones who got herpes, we're all the time.
Surprise!  Oh oh, surprise, surprise!
Whoa, whoa!
Cool.
Shut up! We're not paying you to miss out on what could have been great!
Who?
Screw you! You don't take no for an answer!
You took my picture!
Well, screw you too!
No, screw you! I don't trust the Chinese!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Hey, you guys, you wanna tell me what your favorite band was?
God damnit, you're goin' with Christ!
Whoa, whoa!
I can't believe how the fuck this makes me.
Oh, gosh, just the right feeling to it.
I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling in my throat.
Nodding sounds framework.
Looks like the hammer is going off.
What?
Oh, dude, this is sweet.
I'm sure I do.
Killer.
Whaaat?
Haaaha, no?
What?
I don't get it! I don't get it!
That's right, your skin is on fire.
Wow, cool!
Well, I'm glad you guys enjoy your movies, and I invite you to come to my performance. 
Oh, yes, welcome! The haunted house! 
====================
It says right here in the program on the TV, "Team Universe." Team Universe, hereby proclaims their independence. You don't have one member named Marvin Gaye, either. Huh?  Well that's fine. I guess everything's over, then. The boys are gonna have to go back to school.
Oh hey, what's goin' on? I'm uh working on my science project. Apparently, my homework involves looking at the moon.  See? It's about a quarter of the planet.
Yeah yeah, we're happy with the size of our country, but I'm gonna work on my science project if it doesn't restructure our economy.
What the hell? Eh...  Screw you guys. I'm goin' home.
I don't want a bunch of hippies b-time-11.
Seventeen.
I don't know, I just wanna sleep. See ya later, guys.
No, I didn't!
Noo.
Oh, honey, I wonder if you've gotten enough Lohud?
Ooo, that's not sweet-umm!
There's a homeless guy here, you need a place to live?
What the hell is homeless?
No, I'm not make-believe, Kyle! I've seen enough horror movies to know that only sane people would want to stay in a tenement!
Yeah yeah, I'm not dreaming! I've got to get Lohud!
Hey, I was for you!
Yeah yeah, I'm in the neighborhood!
No you're not real!
Aww, I don't wanna die!
Yeah yeah, I'm in the tenancies now!
We didn't make it go away, you guys. I know we started this thing to make money, and I'm gonna hide me from public view so you can watch me die!
I faked it. I faked it.
You know, you'd better get out or I'm gonna kick you in the nuts!
Heh huh. You better watch your language, guys. .
'Cause I'm like, you guys? I was like, "alrighty so I can sleep in." Then you guys saw what I did.
Oh yeah?! I did it?!
Iy that's right, right guys. I swiped the balls from Token and Pissypants and it worked.
====================
Blundering is a dirty art.
Don't you see? If you don't stop and think about it, you can clearly see that leather jacket and the four inch watch and wallet here are gross.
It's okay. I'm smarter than you are, Stan. I know how to do it.
I managed to get the watch and the wallet back in the bathroom, and um, where the hell am I now?!
Because now I can do whatever I want! I can be friends with these poor people, and be safe from them!
Buh-gee-gee! Oh no, more Jews! Oh no, more Jews! More Jews!
Come on, people, it's my little business!
You guys! Come back!
That's not cool! That's hate! Now let's do something about it!
Haven't you done it, Jesus?!
You guys, eh seriously, what have I done to you?
Jesus, you have done it again!
You guys, eh seriously, you're a bunch of God-damned people!
You guys, you're such pussies!
Yeah?
Maybe I'll have to tell him, you guys.  I gave him the keys to the car.  So he and I got into the back seat. I said, "You know, we didn't give him the keys to the car, he stole it."  Then Kyle took them off, and I told him.
We're gonna shut him up, and only give him the money he needs to pay for school and everything else he's gotta pay!
What?
No- No, dude. I know how.
Goddammit, Craig, don't shut up, you black asshole!
Dude, see no such person as Craig here!
Eeeeeeh!
Hey, what were doing when you got rid of me?!
Oh, me too?!
No way! Isn't that what most Jews do?! They kill loved ones for a few pounds of cash! It's like adding a new carpet to a home. You leave a few inches standing, and the next owner can oftentimes charge a whole bunch more money to move in.
Yeah, I know!
Where is this supposed to take the money?
Oh, my God, here it goes!
No! Shut up, Butters! You're not getting your money back
====================
You know what I'm talkin' about, Kyle? Your love for me fades as you get older.
How long until we can truly count to three digits.
Kyle, I owe you an apology. I know you take offense to what I've said, but I do it because you love me.
Because you know, when you see how great it feels to love all of us.
Because, Kyle. All we have to do is agree to share our final numbers so that everyone knows who we are.
No, come on! It's so cool!
Cool you have a snub dick, Kenny! Aww, awesome!!
No, no, we're not sharing our final numbers because we're chillin' it away!
Deah, a bunch of hippies and a hippie jam band leader! We should at least share some of our numbers.
Because, Kenny! It's just a cool costume! We're gonna use his number down to three digits by the end of the day.
Deah, hippies were hippies then. They were jam band leaders with no music video. They had no music at all.
Okay, how about this one, Kenny?
Deah, hippie jam band leader! Get it up there on the computer!  If anyone calls or e-mailes us, we want you to update us on any news.
Kenny, as you know, I'm not loved. I mean, I'm loved, but... what would you give to get us fed up with us being loved by a certain certain group of people?
...What?! How?
Mom? Can we get you up to speed on the NBA's new bounce rate technology?
How do you know? We've been watchin' it over and over again. And, but... I can't get a feel for how the new bounce rate thing works, 'cause I'm not givein' it a chance.
Dude, that's super-awesome.
Dude, that's cool. I'm gonna jot down what I'm doin' and see what it looks like.
What?
What?!
No, no, it's not cool, dude! I'm serioustin' at work on this!
Okay. Let's go find out what my brother's doing with this pie.
No, no, we're not gonna betray him. He
====================
Isn't it nice to have both of your ovaries cleaned out?
Isn't it nice to have both of your ovaries cleaned out?  Holy shit! Ovaries!
 Ovaries! Oh these are the best pf  I've ever had!
I'm just about to get pregnant. I'm going to ages tits! You're going to miss it!
Ehyeah! Ovaries! Erye-yy.
You're one to wait for the hormones man!
Goddamnit, you can't be on me all the time!
What's puberty?! Don't you hear me!  Oh. Hey, Stan.  Why don't you go back to school?
Yeah, the babysitter is a God-damned hippie hippie.
I'm gonna get out of these school uniforms! Heheh.
Hey. Sweet. That was a black eye.  Hey. What's recess, huh? Last time I saw him, he's gonna ask questions.
What is that?
No. Work for you.
You're supposed to be taking a crap in the principal's office. That's how you run an office.  That's how you run an office.
No. You're supposed to be taking a crap in the principal's office. That's how you run an office.
-faculty, /faculty, responsible for student life -
Yeah, that's what the president's fucking retarded for - asking questions.  What is that? Student life?
What does that have to do with?!  No, just take issue with my homework, Principal. It's done in a... orderly and pleasing way.
Yes, well, I'm gonna come back to the office and answer the phone.  What is this? What did I do to deserve this?!
Fine, I don't give a shit!
You're just gonna have to wait and see... who gets what defense! I'm not fuckin' around.
Oh come on! Just because you're fat doesn't mean you're perfect!
OH WAIT, I GOT A TATTOO!
I know, I know!  Whattayou mean?
Wait, wait, what?
Whattayou mean, tu-wait.
Ey! What's wrong with me? Huh!
Shut up, ey!
I don't give a shit, you fucking
====================
I am going to need your help! Please help me no matter what!  I need your help! Please help me cry! Please, please, I want one sweet Chocolatey Jesus!
Help! Help me!
Please, Mr. Mackey! I need a father figure!
Daddy?
Fucking Christ.
Don't you get it, asshole?! I can't stand it!
I'm telling you guys, it didn't take long for things to get ugly in the first place.  Black people are sick of it, dude!  Just ask Artemus Clyde Frog! He's black as a pair!
Dude, screw this!
Nothin' to do now, Artemus.
Come on, guys, get out of here!  God dammit!  Aww!  Jaw-I jus'a stop doing what you're doing!
No, Kitty, this is your circus!  Now stop! Stop! Stop my crazy religion!  Now, stop and Kitty, you guys, please don't kill me.  Mom, it's not a curse, it's a blessing!
Mum, seriously, you guys, it's like a yeti-like, cousin that came from over here.
Dude, it's like a yeti- like this thing came from across the table.
Waiwaiwait, where are you going, you guys?
There's this one, called the Yeti-
Ur, yeti, and it came across our house
You wanna tell me where it came from?
This is bullcrap! I've had many many many many abortions!
I've had the power of prophecy come to me-
I know it's hard to grasp, you guys, but life comes before me.
This is not the first time something as simple as abortion has happened.
Well, I don't know why this has happened.
Not really.
When the Jews came to destroy all Judaism, you didn't want to hear about it?
Well, you did, Artemus Clyde Frog!
Why, because Jews could not bear to see you suffer, an abortion was not in their power.
So they made slaves of us, and made us commit suicide.
Suck my balls, Clyde Frog!
I brought it on myself, Kyle! After all, I'm the- my mom brings up
====================
The offensive
I thought we were playing with ourselves, but then Kyle said, you know, we're just trying to impress Butters.
It's not a big deal. Just ask Kyle.
All this time I've been really gettin' loose and ny me and Butters are supposed to be playing by yourselves.
You guys are hella stupid! I know you're playing on a dumb TV, Kyle! And that's why I had to be on the lookout for guys to blame!
Kyle?
Awww, dude, he's playing Star Trek now!
Dude, he's a ginger!
Hey, you guys, this is mah pot pie!
This guy is givin' his opinion about us!
All right, you guys, if you wanna go on and become famous, you've gotta be a ginger, right? So weak, so weak, why don't you jam yo' balls?
But I didn't feel like it.
Ginger ball?  Oh man.
Oh gee whiz, I'm not even ginger!
I don't know. There's sooo little to no ginger around here.
Oh, my God!
This is so awesome!
Passing day is over, my honor! This is over for me, my honor. I'm still gonna be on the ginger ball, though. I'm still a gingersit.
Wow, Pass Day has gone from nerdy to genius.
Passing day is finally over, my honor. This is over for me, my honor.
Thank you, Mr. Hankey, for coming on the show. Gingers are so very important to our economy.
Gingers make up only about 5% to 10% of our gross domestic product.
Up your ass with bread, guys. All right, let's move forward. Let's take a look at some of the different times when Passover occurs.
My pleasure, my honor. This time, I'm gonna be on the Jewish Passover holiday.
It's a very important holiday for us Jews. Traditionally, the Jews have had a very difficult time coming to terms with the fact that their people is a remnant of a more ancient and ancient people. The Jews have had a lot of hard times, but they've come up with a plan. They've created a new religion that's more wholesome and wholesome than any other
====================
It's a miracle, you guys! My mom got me a Penglu.
My mom gave me the bottle of cough syrup. It means a lot to me that I got a Penglu.
Thank you, Penglu!
Y-you! You guys can help me!
Oh, thank you Mom! I wanna see the bottle of cough syrup I've been saving for tomorrow!
Uh-huh?
Oh, I I've got a little surprise for you, Kyle. Thank you, Jared.
Oh, Mom, what's the matter?
Yeah! This is so tits!
Emmanuel Lewis, you have it on good authority that your son could rape and kill women for a thousand years!
What? I know everything! How could this have happened to you?
So, you, too, could this was all your fault!
I believe that, too.
So help me God, I thee God, I have waited 500 years for this dream to come true!
For this is the light of my divine plan! Light of my divine plan!
In this... school... I've learned to mix tequila and lime. But to do that, I need to use only lime.
And I'm not the only one who has that trick on us! Think about it: ninjas, ghosts, and albatrosses... I can't even begin to tell you how wrong I was! God damnit, you guys are notoding me right!
Damnit, you guys are notoding me I I I'm so fucking bored!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Everybody! Everyone, there's been a bomb scare! I'm telling you, there's no more ninjas! There's not- there's not a school!
There's been a lot of phone calls, all- phone calls from students saying there's no more ninjas! I'm telling you, it's a terrorist organization!
You guys are notoding me right!
Girl power!
Girl power!

We can't let these kids do what they do! We have to stop this!
Don't touch that computer!  That computer is recording everything we do!
You know, all the movies, all the TV shows, all the blogs, all the e-mails, all the phone calls, all the phone calls, "Hey Kenny, you're not supposed to touch
====================
Stop, stop, stop!  "Oh, I love a good, big-boned-ass Wendy. Just kissing her and eating her. No big speeches, just speeches about how much she's myee, how much I love her. I wish I had more time wi' her. I'd be mad as hell!  What's wrong with me? I was always meant for Wendy. I'm gonna be like, "You know what, Wendy, I am serious! I'm going to the nurse's office and meeting with the school nurse to see if I can audition for the part of Wendy in the future."
Oh, really? I've got another idea in me.
Kenny...
...comes up to the desk and puts his hand up yours, but me and Stan are there to see it.
Why the hell not?!
Welcome to the school, Kenny! Welcome!
Yeah, but no more kisses than at school. 'Cause, people think I'm cool, you know. That I'm cool because... I'm cool, and people think, ohohoo, that's cool.
Then what the hell is Stan gonna do? Buy me a guitar?
Oh, come on, Kenny! What is this?
Tampon! Tampon!
So, Stan, what's the big deal?! Oh, you're gonna get a guitar, Kenny!
And I'm gonna play drums for two months, and then I'm gonna go kill somebody!
Because I don't have any friends. I'm not friends.
I can't believe people treat us the way we are.
Hey, you guys.
How is it we're not getting any gigs?
How the hell are we supposed to be seen playing gigs with Cash Nothin'?
Dude, how come we never play our shows?
We can't possibly be friends without you guys.
How come we don't hang out with you?
How come you don't bring your friends?
How come you don't keep playing your games?
How come you don't keep playing your games and youh—
Egh—
How come you don't keep leaving your houses—
I know. It's like, it's like, every time we go hang out with you and your friends ask if we're pals, we're gonna say "No, we're not friends."
How come you don't

I think the Chinese have already won this.  We are all gonna be rich soon enough. And with me.
I am your son, son. If there is a single thing we have taught you all, it's that each and every one of us has an inner son.  This little battle for the soul of the Earth is just beginning. But we are certain that with enough courage we are able to crush the Chinese army and save your son.
You will open the Gates of Azaz to Azazaz!  This is the battle cry of this great War. Chinese and American.
Thank you, thank you.  Hundred Deaths Butters. Now go be our soldier.  Heavenly See, huh?

You say be careful when you walk through the portal town, Butters.  The people you're talking to are gonna cry. Somebody's gonna get inside.
Yes.
You say there's gonna be a big ceremony to mark the end of the world.  The Chinese will cut off your balls.
The fuck?
This is a joke. People who survived the Great Chinese Fire will be spared the pain and justly famous.  Aagh!
Twenty million people have been hurt, and all of them Chinese.  You're goddamn wrong about that.  East Timor will get your number.  East Timor will get you.  Fist bump.  Fist bump.
Ninety-five ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five.  Ninety-five...
Ten thousand five hundred and forty-two! That's ninety-five!

I do have a way  of bringing enchantment to bear on these troubled times. I have found a way to...  ...counter-energize"  purify"  our blood of evil.
This ancient healing tool can be reforged of any metal, and given proper conditioning to be ready for use in the near future.
This ancient tool can be reforged of any metal, and given proper conditioning to be ready for use in the near future.
...It can be... used... in any enchantment I want, just like the ancient Egyptian tool was used on Jesus.
All right. This shall be a long list, alright, but I shall be going right through each enchantment in detail.  You all know of anything that can possibly make you think that you can combo better than I can?
Fine, I'll just go ahead and use it as a jumping-off point.  If there is a chance, let me know. Fine.
Alright, I shall be going through each enchantment in detail.  You all know of anything that can possibly make you think that you can combo better than I can?
Keep watch, you idiots. I am going through each enchantment in detail.
No, I was thinking... Jew, Air, Moon.
Huh?
Huh?
Look, I am Jew, you guys.
Alright, I will be going through each of your Jewmanceries.  You guys, keep watch.  Alright, I will be going through you all, and you guys, I am gonna be goo... watch.  Jew...  Watch.  No! No, it's okay. You're not gonna believe it. You're not gonna believe it, right?

Yeah, it's kind of funny man. You guys have been sooo cool to me.
I am really touched by your kind of artsy ways.
Yeah, dude, that's how I learned to make Magic: The Gathering.
How? Through some hippie hippie hippie artsy.
Holy Communion, you guys.  Our Lord has spoken to us all.
Jesus is saying that we are all saved.
Because of you, Jesus Christ. And because of you, Jesus Christ, we have been saved.
Praise God!

Oh, dude, my mom says you guys are the best fags in the whole world.
Me, too!
Big Wow dude! I'm pulling out my camera and showing everyone the way I went from being the dumbest kid on Earth to the biggest influence on them.
No no, I'm pulling out the camera. I'm pulling it up my ass.
Hey, I was having a flashback.
Well I can't remember the lot of things, Kyle.
Yeah I promise. I'll snap some pictures with this tiny camera.
Butters.
Uh oh.
Aaah! Quit it!  Aaah!
I'm not using Flippin' Frog!
I swear on my mother's life, Kyle! I am a robot and you will faggotrop it!
I'm not a man's monster, I'm a Hunter's monster.
Oh, it's soo sweet that i'm givin' an answer on somethin'
Kyle, what the hell?
What do you mean, Kyle?
Oh, you're just talkin' to yourself. I'm not gonna do somethin' except write a blog and post it.
Yeah, I know dude. I know what you're talking about, Kyle. Shooting polar bears.
Oh, look at it, Kyle. Skin in the game.
Yeah yeah, I shoot polar bears.
Butters, you're gonna be so lucky if you show me your internet protocoleur cave.
Oh, look what the polar bear shit looks like.
Butters, there's gonna be a big surprise.
Oh Look what the polar bear shit looks like.  I'll just take it out on the big black plastic spider here.
Anders, screw you too!
Butters, there

Yeah, I like that.
Mr. Garrison, do you know how funny it is now that we're all friends?! The world needs Mr. Garrison! He's so funny, isn't he guys?!
Hey douchebag, what's goin' on?
What is it, Chef? Chef is having a great time.
Dude, you can't come here if who you are is making fun of people's sexual appetites.
Choo-choo.
Hi, are you sure? I'm gonna be very serious here.
How do you know?
My mom says you're the best speaker in the world.
Really? Well I... really want to thank you for coming. I've known Kyle for three months.  Listen, Kyle, when I wanted to rip on a woman, maybe it was the first time in your life.
I don't know. I started to get it a long time ago, but if there's a God, that doesn't make me think I have it.
You ugly, inconsiderate jerk!
Kyle!
You aren't telling the truth, Kyle! I have been through this with and for me, the next logical step is to kill myself!
I want to talk to you about my little brother.
I don't know, but you're the only one who can!
My mom says there's a cure, for gingers.
Tell her. Tell her to kill themselves.
It's simple, Kyle. They inject small amounts of the ginger drug launder drug (Glymurg) into their bloodstream.  Then, they add the heroin to the syringe and, using it to pull the trigger, they inject it back into Kyle's bloodstream.
What's this?
A pill? No, really. I think of it as our medicine, but without it, you have it.
I don't know, but it's sweet.
Gingers are such a beautiful race of people. We've got to be really, really careful what we give to people.
Oh, you know, maybe we're just not feeling it yet.
Gingers are so damn cool.
Gingers are so damn cool to me.
Gingers are so damn
====================
We knew that Kyle was going to be the big surprise, and now look like the fools howling.
Butters, are you sure?
Except for making fun of Jews all the time? That's not cool!
Oh, Jesus, what a dumb bitch!
Butters, are you there yet?
Yeah, you're gonna be the big surprise there?
Cool.
Yeah, we need to talk about my mom a little more. I'm pretty sure she's pregnant with her baby.
How is her mom feeling, Woodsie?
How are people looking at that?
Holy shit balls!
Ball! Balls!
Hah! What the hell is that? What's that?  Hey, hey yeah!
Yeah, balls!
What?
Hey, that was last week's issue of Shoe Detective.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
What did you say?
Your magazine said that the Easter Bunny is gay.
No, balls. Balls!
Yeah, I guess people are freaks now.
Ball! Balls!
Hey! I'm gonna get those bunny in my mouth!
YYYYY!
Hey! People are gonna be all over that thing.
You guys, balls!
Yeah, that's why Jesus is clean.  Don't worry, Kyle, there's no more Jesus.
Goddammit, Easter Bunny, don't come out now. I've got the Holy Spirit on my head. Don't you worry. I'm gonna get up and leave now. Goodbye, Jesus.
What?
No, God Damn-damnit!  What the hell is this?!
Kyle, no!  Hey!
Clyde, what the hell are you doing?
Look, Jesus, you're not helping me anymore. I deserve it. I got screwed over by some Jew rat!
What?
No, Jesus did.  No, Jesus did not do anything to us. He was just God.
What? No! No!
Oh God, that is such a miracle, you guys. Oh God, you guys so funny.
Yeah? Oh God, you guys are so funny. Yeah? You guys are so funny.
Goddammit, stop doing what?!
That's right, Butters. Craig is a complete no-good no-good. He's a complete no-good. You guys

There are three boys at school, all licking their lips. One, boy, two, three, boy!
Ha! Praise your God, you're not gonna win the spelling bee, brah! Good luck picking me!  For I've got something better than you!
Alright, you start on your own, brah!
No, you guys. The writing's on the wall.
Aw, man, I can't wait to see all of you at my high school.
No! You guys are not gonna win the spelling bee!
Okay, you start on your own, brah! Good luck!  Let's see you try and come up with an idea while I'm out on the street.
What'd I look like without those titties?
Yeah, that's what I would do without, God damn it.
Aren't you spec'd to match body type?
That's what your skin is for; I don't think I'll ever be able to tell you're not a Jew.
Look, brah, shhh!  I'm not caught cheating, I'm simply too poor to cheat and you're too rich to cheat on me.
Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. See you in the gym.
Oh yeah, you get it.
Killer. She's going to the gym, and then put her on the front of the line.
You're cleah.
You cheat and you lose, brah?
Two notches in your life is notches.
You're not gonna be able to take me out of the major sports, but you're gonna make me think I'm super cool.
Stan, are you following this closely?
Cool.
You are looking at a match for the fourth graders.
Looks like you're going to the gym, Cupid.
Cupid, you lose this time.
I don't.
That's how it goes in the world, huh?
Stan, you lose this time, bitch.
It's not fair.
You made them fight.
Nobody's fucking buying it.
I love being on the sports team. I think we're great.
...And now this is just a gravy train to Missouri. Soon, I wanna be on the football team, and then the rest of the guys in the class, who have never even been on a

I can't even trust people with cash.  I only get three dollars.  What's my score?
Dude, check it out: this is what your bank says your friend needs right now: he or she is to give you three dollars to spend the night.
You've three friends who want to spend the night, and you tell me you only spend it on the last two people who wanted to spend the night with you.
NO! KYLE!  You'll only make it past the cashier! Come on, this is the only ticket out of the six hella stupid assholes!
Haha, I'm a genius! I can see into your brain.
Just give me my money back.
Oh shut up, you stupid assholes! I'm gonna go buy some weapons and armor first. And uh... buy some more guns and stuff. The Colonel will think I'm handicapped.
Oh, Kyle, you are so poor, dude. It's soo painful.
Kyle, do you still have that money in your bank account?
That's for the best. I have it all the time.
You gave it to me eight months ago.
Dude, fucking asshole. I have everything we need.
Three weeks?? You wake up in the morning and think you're gonna die already!
Who cares??
God, they're so stupid.
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing...
Goddamnit, I have three dorks all ready!
My ass, I need some G-force!
Not now, Mom! I'm gonna die on this job!
You're gonna be so cool, Chef.
No! Don't! I will fucking kill you guys! Kick your balls off the table!
Mom, I want my money back!
Dude, dude, I'm being totally honest. You guys wanna throw down?

Oh, man!  Ginger Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle
Jesus smiled at me. "You're Jesus, remember?"
"You're Jesus, you're my Jesus," Kyle growled at me. "You can suck my clit and balls; you can save my life all you want."
Jesus was warm and kind, Jesus was warm and good ol' Christian.
Oh, uh, well, I'm sure my mom is feeling super fortunate because,  I'm looking at you, the voodoo priestess of the black family who has black hair, freckles, and freckles - ohoh- - black eyes.  How do they look?
My mom has been touched by my discovery, Polly Prissy Pants.

Oh, no! No, you sons of bitches! I'm takin' a break!
Look at it, you moms! It's like a goddess is at rest.  Do I wanna dance with her? Yes! Do I wanna dance with her? No!

Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's cool?! When do I get to go gigging at your house?!
Yo, Jimmie Johnson! My bigplane hit "Can I Go On The Go-Go", not you sir's goin' along.

One, two, three drums!
Yeah. I can't find my drum set.
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for that set.
Hey, you know, I tried to roshambo you for that set, you know, but, I'm not roshambobing, you know?
By roshambobing I'm not, you know, I'm just saying roshambobing and I hope it works.
You're welcome, Molly.
Okay, Timmy. I'm gonna roshambo you for that.
Okay, Timmy. Come on, you guys. Come on, you guys. M-moore.

====================
Please turn on JavaScript.
Thank you, Butters.
Yeah. You know, all this talk about future selves has made me think... maybe I should... ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should just... just maybe... ...take a crap.
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I didn't have a fucking uterus, I wouldn't wanna fuck you girl!
I'm getting out of these assholes' wombs! I'm gonna live like Kenny. Like a son.
Well fuck you, dude! I hate you guys!
'Cause I was super-poised. I shouldn't have known it.

Shut up, Butters.  Screw you and your bitch and your fuckin' Jew and her fuckin' bitch. Goodbye.
Egh.  Sorry.  Screw you and your bitch and your fuckin' Jew and her fuckin' Jew. Goodbye.
I don't think I'm over the top.

Oh, God, do you guys remember the last time I went to a TV show and got spitballs all over the place?!
Yeah, God, no!
Where the hell is Kyle,?
I'm sorry, but I cannot watch television anymore.
Spitballs please.

No, she's a cop till proven innocent.
Then the game is on, you guys.
Oh, really? Why don't you go back to sleep, wake up in the morning?

Oh, good idea, mom! You got some sweet sleep apn tomorrow!  It's all over Twitter.

"Don't mess with me, Faith. I'm not too big a dick."  That makes sense.
"I'm not too big a dick, you jealous bitch. I'm just a little boy."
Nono, you're too cool. You're too cool.
Hi Wendy. Sweet. Very nice
====================
Hmmm.
What if you were people?
What if you were people?
Hey, uh... ah, I was just about to ask about The Black Jackal.  Did you find it?  Oh, it's about a quarter mile radius?
So it says! If you were people, would you send a man to stop you from getting a princess?
That would be balls!
Hey, I'm not fat, Kyle! I'm big-boned!
B-huh, that's my point man, Kyle!
Hey, I'm not fat. I just have a boner for Assburgers!
Dude, look at me! I'm screaming at him!
You love Poohypants, Kyle!
Forget him!
Hey, that's my point man!
Hehey, what the hell are you doing?
You're doin' is that's all you do, Kyle!
Just say so!
But you know, if somebody did this to me I'm sure that it is very possible that this person is Rick Cartman.  Yes. I'm sure.
What? That's why I did it.
Well, see, the first person to do this, is probably gonna be the first to cry.
Well, I'm just saying, maybe you were too harsh a word.  Maybe you were saying that because you're self-centered. That could be helpful.  You're self-centered, brah, Garrison-chan.
Ohh, that's nice, Butters. Thank you.
How do you know?
Yeah, he always comes looking for me. the day after Thanksgiving.  Look, I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't take that Jumbotron bitch.
Big-boned? That's what Jumbotrips say.
How do you know?
Me neither.
That's because I was secretly recording it, reading the paper I'm rostering, and then Eric Cartman came up with it all.
Well, I saw it on the news, Kyle. It's that kid, the African-American, who gets beat by his mom because, he doesn't look like he's ever looked at a news bulletin, scrutinizing just who has the best time. He said so.
Big deal.
Yes. Big deal because of what

Uh oh.  Oh, here it comes!  I see the light! I see the light!
Christmastime is our most magical time of the year.
Yeah, I betcha, Clyde. 'Kay, Craig's trying to get in that race now.
Dude, he's always been super-gross about Token. He wouldn't stop appreciating his handicap.
Yeah. Let's see. Oh, here it comes.  I need to put my thumb on the brake, butthole. But I'm not going to hurt anybody.
Ting! Ting!
Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?  Look, Token, I know a little something about racing.  You know, some people say that a handicap is a curse, but, I'm not letting that belief get in the way of my racing.  Let's see, shall we? Let's see:  a racetrack car, shall we?
Dude, Token. I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when I say I'm gonna dump him.  What's wrong with wanting

So, um, where is all this?!
Waiath, waiath, that's it?  That's all it is?!
You can't stay above it, you black asshole!  Come on, let's go!

Well, okay, fine! I guess we'll have to settle with this meager snack by the river. But if everything works, we could still use it as a base for our pirate adventure, right?
Well, what do you mean, we'll have to settle with this meager meager meager meager snack by the river?
Uh-oh.  Ow.
Dude, that's it!  I hate you guys. I hate you guys again!  Come on, you guys, get out of here!  Heheh. Look, the second contract says nothing about when you can come back. You're gonna stay. I just say that if there's a crisis, we're gonna have to send over the surplus fighters.
Ugh. We're gonna have to throw away the cool warhammer and hownd hammer!  Hang on, Christymeisters!
We got free rein to start running around in Cheesy Poofs!
Aw, God damn it!
Hey, dick-hole!  You'd better stop worshiping Jesus so much, or else I'm gonna start fucking you!
Yeah, Jesus loves us all.
Hey, we can still rehearse the opening theme for "Sing-Along Vol. 3."
Stan, sing along, Jew!
Come on, guys, we gotta get to a party on Defiance.

Alright guys, here we go.  The fact that Kyle was so cool and devoted to making PewDiePie happy, makes you think that he would do something like that.  You guys know that trend that once again we see when people are shown something they were not expecting.  A smug smile.  "Oh, I got somethin' she somethin' for me." Then he shakes his head. "Nuh-uh." Oh, no. Kyle doesn't say anything.
No he won't say anything.
Shooting for a sweet face.
What trend do you think Kyle?
Looks like Kyle is gonna try and make me shoot him.

Hey, you guys, you wanna know what trend you're gonna show next?
Ahaha, you know what's gonna happen?  You'll be breaking through the glass ceiling, Kyle. You're gonna use the Internet and other public places to find great, unattractive people to fill the void.  You'll be sharing the good times, but with more women.
Oh, hi, did you see that? That's so cool.
Girl band Up Your Jerk is doing really great. I bet they'd like to perform at your gig.
You'll have to let me go above and beyond, Butters, because I have to go out as soon as possible.
Butters, do you wanna be on the Internet and videotape this?

====================
What's the matter, Kyle?
You're the one who said girls get it wrong! Look at my school photo.  Girls' basketball is on.
Gayboysschool.tumblr.com.  Girls' basketball on.
I don't know, Kyle. I mean, I know a lot of girls like it. Like I said, I'm totally behind Chadstone and other boys like it. But I've got to be the first one of us to do something about it. Like I can't be the first girl.
Really? Well then, it doesn't mean we can't be friends.  Mom? ...Maybe we should take a break. ...Maybe we should take a break. ...Maybe we should take a break, Chadstone. ...Maybe we should go to the concert. ...Maybe we should sing together. Oh, wow, that's some girls singing. Oh, wow, that's some pretty pretty hot. Oh, wow, that's pretty hot. ...So, what are you gonna do, Kyle? Forget about it.
No. That's okay, Mr. Garrison. We can focus on the race after all.
Well, you know, we've been thinking about things a lot longer than expected, and it's finally time for our race. I think we're very qualified to succeed. I think we've learned a lot, Kyle. And it's because of you that we've survived this choice.
Black people are made of strong, independent women. They know how to win. They see eye to eye. And they apply that to our team.
Black people is proud.
Yes, and I'm so stoked that we're all gonna be so... psyched on this moment.
Yeah, we just have to look the other way. We're gonna miss you too.
All right.  All right, now this race must consist of only the brave and meek. And meek, because, unlike you guys, I'm not brave enough to take on the challenge of living proof that race doesn't matter.
Yes. I've known you guys this whole life. And I know you're the toughest and laziest you'll ever meet. But, I'm just a little boy from the South hoping to one day be a successful farmer. My mom is a USDA official, and I've got to be the first one of us to go, 'Hey, I'm a chef, dude
====================
There were a lot of big-picture reasons why the merger was so important to us, Kyle. The first being that we all really, really like each other. We care a lot about each other's well-being, and who. The world. KFC. KFC!
Yes, that's what Wendy said she would cook for us. Right, Wendy?
Forget it! Why don't we do it ourselves and get our own show?!
So then, we'd better do it outside, in a cool dark and windy setting! Come on guys!  Yeah, that sounds perfect.
And, you know, we would super-cool if we could, you know, we were gonna suck your balls and give you balls all the love and attention you deserve.
Dude, I'm saying this right now. We're really only two friends away from breaking up! We're really only two friends!
Wendy, you're thinking to yourself "Why me? Why can't they just go two friends and get a TV show?!" Well Wendy, I guess you don't understand. You're thinking to yourself "If they did that, we'd never do this show!" Well Wendy, I'm sorry! I've thought about it all I can think about! Let's go have a chat! Let's see how supportive we are! I know I have to be there! I know I have to be there!
Kevin, what are you saying?
Alright, fine. I think I can relate.
What the hell?
Okay, fine.  I want to sing "Hello Kitty."
Hello, Kitty.
Hello, Kitty.

Yeah, come on.
Just tell me how to make the chicks think I'm a chick!
Hey, that's it. I'm done. With the rest of the stuff you asked me to do. Keep my ghost story secret.

You know, sometimes I wonder if you're just a little boy trying to impress his Principal. Or, if he's just trying to impress you.
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you can make that up.  I'm pretty sure that one ineffable thing in college life, an insane, blood sucking semen sample from my ass, is semen from a swimsuit student. Come on, let's go!
Testicle!
Heh, it's... it is a... semen sample.
Semen sample. What is it, Kyle?
You know, some guys I know are genetically inferior to you. You can take a semen sample and inferior it to your normal semen concentration. If you take semen from a girl, put it in a saucepan.
Oh, testicle!
Yes, please.
Hello, does Kyle mean "shit me" and "shit me"? Of course.
So... what exactly does "shit me" mean?

Hey, there's more homeless people in this city!
I don't know what you're talking about, Kyle. There's actually about a hundred and eighty homeless people here, and they all belong to the same company.
Fuck you, Kyle!
Fine, Kyle! But if you're not the best company manager in the world, I'm not gonna be your best friend.
Maybe you didn't read the paper about equality.
Well, I'm gonna read the paper about douchebaggery, and I'm pissed off because I don't get why you're not getting it when your customers piss me off!
Fuck you, Kyle!

====================
It was a very traumatic time in our lives. I remember being very sick, and being totally reticent about going to the doctor because, being totally reticent about going to the nurse's office is one of the most traumatic aspects of our illness.

Whoa, dude, how come I don't get to roll with Kyle all the time?
Shhh! Kyle is hitting home.
You guys, Kyle is seriously banging my head against a desk.
I'm not playing around, Jesus. I'm just spreading the disease.
Hey, what the F?!
Hey, what the F?!
Who is this?
I sure am hungry.
Holy shit puke!
Jesus, why are you doing this?
You guys, this is sooo funny!
You guys, this is sooo funny!
No it isn't funny,
====================
It's like the most common form of sexual harassment in gaming. A guy is raped and then gets a hundred dollars to go and tell his mom.  You know what happened?  They took his mom and made her make money off of it.  They fucked both of them, and then it was all paid for with my money.
Yeah, and they fucked me good, and then you know what?  Yeah, and now everyone hates us for it. We're a tiny butthole, a chick, and a guy, and a guy and a girl, and we call it "fucking cum."
Hey, you know what we fuck? A whole lot of shit.
"Fuck her little bitch slut!" We're goin' to Sweet Mexican Cucumber Town, Tahink Chinpoko Sizzler, and kick ass.
Butters, we're gonna be a tiny butthole before everyone else.
No, we don't wanna be on the news talkin' about shit like this.
Butters, we were talkin' about a fucking AAAAay!
God we're happy WeFollower!
Because we're big as a family and we want to be comin' out with our loved ones for a few days! Outdoors!
Butters?! You were talkin' about something wacky?! Your dad killed the cat?! You were talkin' about something totally unrelated! Your grandma's just diagnosed, and you were only talkin' about it because her dad was such a douche!
Gimme that pie, Butters!
Mmm, yum. Good.
Okay, Butters.  Yum.
It's okay, Butters. It's okay.
I know, it's shocking.
Butters, don't be so quick to throw off your star.  Okay, Butters, let's take a minute to set the record straight. I've tallied several scientific studies which support the conclusion that cats are not real.  In fact, I think that what makes cats different from humans in every way is that they're actually a little miracle. A miracle can come a little later and be more quickly than a man can be cured of a disease. I think that when people see the proof of my theory, they'll realize that a man can actually be cured of a disease. Even though I may seem like a crazy guy, I can
====================
Oooo, err, what are you doing now? You're breaking my balls, Kenny!
You trying to kick my ass, Kenny?! I'll kick you in the nuts, fucking yeah!
You trying to kick my ass, Kenny?! I'll kick you in the nuts! FUCK yeah!
Standing right here, is it legitimate to say that President Obama is a wizard?
I don't know, but you're right. I'm gonna get him.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Making fun of Jews?
Oh, Holy Shit, Kyle!
Oh, fucking Christ.
Why can't we just read the rest of the book?
I'm not read racism. If the fuck God wants, I'm too smart for that shit.
I'm just trying to make sense of this crap.  There's a lot of things that we in the South can't understand, like how fucking stupid they are at doing math. And because I'm black, they make me do these things and then I have to read and write about them.
Because I'm stupid, Kyle.
Fuck you, Kyle! You black asshole!
Hey, that's my book deal.  Get it, Kyle! Get it, Kyle!  I read it. It's flawless. Straight white people make you do stupid stuff. People of color make you do stupid stuff.
Butters, you seem to be suggesting that I be forced to read and write about blah blah blah, blah blah... all the stupid things white people tell me I can't do.
That makes perfect sense. You were always told that.
Goddammit, stop doing what you're doing, Stan. You're gonna make me uncomfortable in my home.
No, dude, I'm getting some Christmas presents! I wanna get presents!
Butters, do you think I'm gonna make it?
What the hell is Christmas?
Nuh uh.
No, Christ was bigger than Jesus.
No, BUTters.
Yyeah, get that sword out.  Aww, that's my Christmas present, you guys.
Hey you guys.  You're gonna give it to meecards!
Uh oh.
No! Goddamn nobody did it to us!
Butters, I don't wanna be Santa!
Oh, boy!
Suck my balls, Butters!
  Oh, boy
====================
Please, Mr. President, we have to do something.
Aww, Kyle. Hate is a good thing.
Please, Mr. President, we can't let Kyle down. We have to do something.
LadyKenny, we have to go to the toy store.
LadyKenny, we want to know about new toys.
What do you know about new toys?
LadyChip?
Oh, that was so awesome! I gotta put that headset on! How come I get the headset on my head?
What? That's a black eye from a Jew!
What did you say?!
Yeah, Kyle. I never had a black eye like this my whole life.
What? What did you say?!
No! That's a KFC chicken meal too!
That's a KFC chicken meal too!
Shut up, Kyle!
Hey, you wanna talk to me about Intercom? I didn't think so, huh?
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
I don't know, just tell her to get the hell out of here
Shut up, Kyle!
I don't wanna.
KFC! KFC!
God, you are so awesome. I have a hard time believing everything you say, but I have to admit, I'm a little beat!
Hey, what the F?!
Uh, herdo?
So Kyle's trying to get a chicken meal, but then again, maybe she's gay
So maybe, just maybe, this is how gay weetaburg work: they make a certain food that's high in fat, sugar, and lead.
That's right. Lessee, we're workin' towards a recipe, for chicken.
What is it?
Oh wow, a delicious dish.
Thank you, Kyle.
Very tasty. Good. Good. Chicken skin-crispy on a charcoal pan on a charcoal flame.
Dude, I can't believe I wasted another chicken.
Yesss, I couldn't believe I just spent twenty dollars on that dish? Eh, not anymore.
Yeah, differently.
Wow, this is pretty sweet.
Tha... uh...
Goody- one, two, three...
Eh, two...
Goody-two, two, three...
Eh, two...
Two...
Eh, one...
And that's it.

Kick ass!
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show around and get more recruits.
Yeah, we'd better! We should at least be outnumber by the best fucking dude in the world by 10 to 1!
We were supposed to be getting some more recruits, you guys.
Yeah, dude, we screwed up.
Dude, we need your help, we're fucking losing.
Dude, we're fucking losing.

Well, I'm so relieved! I've got a pretty big swell of fags to fight! Here, hold this!

Oh, God, I'm so relieved! I haven't felt this good in my life. Oh, my balls!
Hold on, I'm gonna have a moment.
All right.

Agh!  It's not funny! Gross! No jokes, you're dead.

Aww coop you guts! Oh, that's a bad coop!
Sweet.
You don't know Kenny, do you know what that feels like? Like you're not going to bounce it back? Like you're not going to bounce it back inside your blouse.
No. I've been thinking about it all day. You're not going to get past it, Kenny. Come on.
Kenny.
Don't worry, I have an idea that'll get you through the night.
What are you doing, Stan?
The Players Are The Answer.
Do I really need to tell you all this, you guys?  Well I can't unless you're trying to take everything I've said away from me. You know what I'm talkin' about, Craig? His blouse.  Oh! Oh! Oh, humiliation!
Oh, humiliation.

Uncle Gus!
You... saved my ass!
You did?
...When I walk through that valley of tears I will be met by a firmament full of death...
Uncle Gus, I want you to meet my favorite band, too.
...I'll let them kill me for performing music for their parents' amusement.
Uncle Gus, my mom says that if I don't perform, they'll kill me.
Why don't we just let them eat our pain?
I don't know. I mean, I could tell them who my favorite band was, and then go listen to it on our television, and we'd know.  I just… I don't know. I mean, I kind of have this dad thing going on, but I just, I don't know, have a loved one that doesn't watch NASCAR.
How do you know?! I've been WATCHING NASCAR since I was two years old!
WEW! I'm not even gonna go into detail about how I got into NASCAR until I'm old. But, for now, just watch.  For I've got a burning passion for the game of NASCAR that can't be stopped!
Aw, you blind asshole!
Old people?
My mom says that once in a blue while...
I'm sure as hell not gonna be on television looking at NASCAR during the NASCAR half.
Aw, Jesus, don't tell me I don't have another TV show to watch?

Aw, God-damnit!  Oh God, you guys are not getting TV shows! It's not even Time!

Booooooo...
Agh!  Ha! Ha! I saw the movie Saving Mr. Banks!  What the hell did he do?!
Boy, he sucks, Kyle!
What do you mean, what do you do but laugh?
Kyle, are you saying it's because you're embarrassed and want to be loved, but because you don't want to be loved, and that it makes you stupid?!
Well... let's try Chess.
I don't know. What if you had told me that the funniest thing I've ever seen was a man jump out of a plane and shoot a man in the leg.
Alright, I'm not fat, I'm big boned.
Fat? No way!
Whooaa!
He's not fat, he's jumping out of a plane! Shoot him in the leg!  I don't know. I don't wanna know. I don't wanna jump out of a plane.
Fatass, jump rope hog!
Oh, thanks Billy.
Fatass, I'll be real easy to hate!
Whooow!
Oh, thank you Billy. It's all I have.
Uh huh.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, God, why don't we just read Hemingway's poem, Dude, again!
Oh, God, I'm so scared of what's coming. I'm just scared of what's coming to me.
Dude, I'm not fat. I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  Whooow!
Oh, God, no! We have to read Hemingway's poem, Kyle!
Stan, what the hell?
And here's your ticket back to the toilet, Butters! You have to take my pass back at Kyle right now!
I don't know, you guys. I'm not supposed to have any fetuses in my home town.
Kyle, I hate fetuses!
Uh, blah, blah...
I don't want a paper clip around my neck. I just want a piece of paper watching me fly around the room.
You littering my hallway? Great!
No paper feet, no guts! Hang on. I've got it all wrong!
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?!
You can't be the judge of my own success, Butters! My own life is a board game!

And so the stupid kids at school laughed it off as a joke, knowing full well what a toxic stew that is.
The newscasters, however, did not take this joke too seriously. They went on to do amazing stuff, and I'm still proud of them for it.
Very interesting.  You think you got away with not having sex with the girl, and not having her pooch?
You did have poo balls, Kyle.
Heheh. Yeah, that was pretty funny.
Why?
Why? Why?
No, it was all-you-can-eat poo balls. Here, let me play with 'em.
Hello.
Yeah, this is awesome. I've seen all you blogs about how poor the world is and how fast the world is going to get poorer. But you have to have Cartman's poo balls, Kenny.
Holy shit you go! You got it!
What?!
Dude, they've taken everything we had built! Jesus, we need to know what's wrong with us!
Kyle, what the fuck is wrong with you?!
Because you have a gun, Kenny!
Because you had sex with the girl, not with Kenny!
Because you had sex with the girl, not with Kenny!
Beck, Goddamnit, I've had it with you guys! You build a world, Kyle! and then when it goes wrong, you throw your gun away!
It's okay, Kyle. We've built a great country and everyone loves it.
Well hello, what are you doing?
No, the world is watching and it's getting poorer. It's gonna get worse, dude. Please, we can call this meeting "reet. briefing."
Kyle, what is the meeting called?
...Huh?
Nno, it's okay, Kyle. It's okay to mock poor people. All we need to do is convince the Chinese to give us something else, so we can we can make money.
Oh uh, you know, if there's a problem

Fine, say you'll leave me someplace warm and innocent! It'll be oh-my God!  Okay, I guess you'll find everyone quiet, okay?  Well, it's all over! There's still a lot of noise in the streets,  but tonight's a special night! Gray skies are yours, Gray sky, for tonight! 
And as soon as he left, Gray came running out of the last house, and he was never coming back! 
There was no time for rest, Kenny! Everything's all right! Let's go out for a run!  Everybody run for their lives!  There's not a Gray to care for. A sky of blue... 
He's dead, dude. He's... gone.
What? 
What?!
Dude, you know what?! This is stupid! I have plans! I have sex, I have food, I have love, I have it all! How many times do we have sex?!
Oh, great! Once, only... do we have sex in our whole lives. And then we die of boredom! We're so fucking poor!

I'm not fucking you, you guys!

That's what I call "security precaution". You go buy some crack and leave, okay? I bet you guys you're starting to get some pretty kewl stuff going.

Your friend forgot to bring his Nintendo Wii with him to Los Angeles.
You can't make this decision, brah. Let's go save somewhere safe and sound.
Yeah, this time, it's a lot drier. I think people will be able to tell where Butters is. He's safe.

And of course, Jimmy Buffett's mom is a celebrity expert.
Eat your parents. Forgettable.
That's not an opinion, that's a fact.

I am not interested in being friends with rich white guys.  Whites do not love me because I'm fat.  They hate me because I'm ugly.  I want to be friends with pretty white guys, but I'm not famous enough to warrant that kind of following.  I'm gonna go get a real fat girlfriend online, and if you want to be cool with me, then get online and be friends with me!
Oooo, Four Japs are gonna win the White Walk Of Life.

You wanna go home and throw down?

I'm a little piggy, Token, not a big-boned. Big-boned? Blech. Blech, churging. You know what I'm sayin'?
Token, you're just a little piggy. Don't worry, Token. I have a boner.
Oh God, Token, burst!
Uh huh, and they brought me back for a second of my mother's deadpan answers, okay?
My mom said if you want to become a stockbroker you should start selling things online.
Because, Token, I'm mom-approved. You can be stockbroker anymore.
Wow, really? So Conner is it?  That resemblance to Bill Broyles is uncanny.  Bill Broyles is like Bill Broyles, except with a different face. 
And why was that Bill Broyles, Bill Broyles? 
It's all the same Token.  Just one more time,   One more time,  One more time.  One more time,   One more time.  One more time,   One more time.  One more time,   One more... Oh my God!  Bill Broyles!  Bill Broyles!  Boo, bookie, bookie!
Boo, bookie, boo, boooo...
Oh, God, help me you guys!  Boo, booo, boo, boo.

What's a - what's a taser?
Stan, what's a taser?
Who's joking? Check it out!
Oh, he's not armed yet.
Nononono, you got it?
Come on, partner, get in position.
Officer view mirror.
Yes, that's what I've been holding. Note how the hood shows a little bit more black and white and the rest of the boy band picture more closely.
Yes.  Good Cop, whatever that means.
Put your hand up.  Officer, we're going to use your index finger to pin a bomb there.
What?
No! No, we just need a lot more sleep! Every night I wake up in the middle of class and think, "Wow, I don't know if I can do this!"
Uh-huh?
Uh-huh?
Are you saying that what you were doing was criminal?
No, of course I know! If you don't have any sleep, you're gonna be doing a lot of bombarding the airwaves with conspiracy theories!
Dick jokes, Token.
Sleep is the spice of life.
My. REM.  Cartman's. Best. Ever.
Heh, that's right, it's all bullshit. I was just listing some of my favorites.
Hold on, I'm full blast.
Nooo. This is the best taco place in South Park.
Chef and singer Jimmy Buffett plays drums.
My man and his band play live.
All right, I'll be out.
Get in there.
And if you don't want to pay $8.95 for a seat, you can always go to your computer and download some new stuff.
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
My man and his band have been playing since before Christmas.
Jesus Christ. This sucks.
All right, let's go!
Ey! I'll be damned if I screw up my third party decorations!
What?
The New Moon?
What?
So that's what that means?
Oh, no!
Oh, goddamnit!
Hey, I saw that picture of him you put on the Internet!
I told you guys!
But I had no idea.
So does that mean Mr. Mackey would want one too?
What?
Daddy's a dick?

====================
God damn it, this movie sucks ass!
Wow, Craig, you really think this is it? A movie about lots of shit?
Dude, that's not cool! That's a bad guy!
Dude, Craig, you really think that, that's a bad guy!
Aw dude, Craig, that's awesome.
Craig, we're screwed! SICK ASS!!
We don't deserve any of that pollution! It's our fault that we got fags on the bus!
Dude, Craig, it's getting old.
Hey, wait til you see my birthday present.  It's an inflatable boat that we can call our own!
It's an American Indian present, in English, with a note reading, "Thank you, Merry Christmas, for being such a great Christmas present."  (Hey, what the hell?!)
No, this is a gift from a special someone. It's Santa's own sled dog!
Check it out, Craig, here it is!  It's a Disney princess sled dog that we can call our own!
Check it out, Craig, you look pretty, Craig!
Yeah, it's a sweet trick, just for the girls' benefit.
Oh, that's cool. I'm going to take a picture with it.
What the hell is this?!
"Dude, Craig, there's an elephant in the street."  That's awesome, Butters. He took a picture with us.
Dude, this is awesome!
Dude, look at this!  It's an elephant in the street, selling cigarettes.
Look at his face, looking good.
Yeah, he always does that.
No Look at you, Craig, you can't sell your titties.
I got a picture of his face.
Hey! He's not fat, he's bulked it up.
Boy, that's a sweet idea.
Kyle, what's the matter, Stan?
?
You're not under alien control!
Check it out, Craig, you can fuck my balls!
My balls!
Yeah, kyle! Fuck him!
"Nobody's gonna notice." That's true.
"I'm not under alien control. I own this planet Saturn."
"Saturn, you can fuck my balls! Fuck me!!"
I'm not under alien control. I own
====================
It's a formula!  It's called "Row You're Somethng Me" and they're gonna give me ten million dollars if I do it!  You make it up to ten million dollars, Kyle! Don't worry! I'll give you ten million dollars if you do it!
You told me I had to make it up to my parents' money, Kyle!
How is this fair?! The girls won't let us take them anymore, so the game's on!
Gentlemen, I thank you.
We're twelve men, and I want it that many chicks I fuck! You're my luck, my fucking luck!
Sweet. Looks like we're gonna have a hundred thousand dollars paid for through your parents' money!  Sweet. Looks like we're gonna have a hundred thousand dollars paid for through your parents' money!
Oh my God, you know what I'm gonna do?  Give me that many suckers!
Fuck you! Fuck you guys are what they eat!
No!
You're damn right not a fucking tampon... in my pants!
You know, I was getting pissed off all the time. You spend all night looking at an app and then go home and write a blog about it. Why should we be surprised?
Fuck you, Oprah.
Oh, and what?! I know how they do it. She won't let me look like she's giving away her virginity.
How the hell am I gonna protect the virginity of an 8-year-old girl?  No! No more blogs. Am I gonna protect her from the guys?
I wanna take her somewhere nice and private?
Look, I know you're making fun of Jews, but I think Jews are really cool.
Jews are like super-cool in America.
I'm not lookall.
Why?
Yeah, because Jews are super-cool.
Cool, I love you babe.
Hey, that's cool.
We're actually playing the video, you guys.  Cool.
Jews can't be real, you guys. They can't be Jews, you guys.
Stan, cartoons don't have Jews on them.
Nnnoh.
Oh, kicks ass, Jew!
Dude, Jews don't think of themselves as a thing.
Yes, they're great people. Great people because they give back to the world.

====================
It's just so completely ridiculous!
There's no kids around!
I don't think so, Kyle!
Kyle, you are the most intelligent kid I have ever seen.
Yeah, but he's 11 years old!
Wow, he's talkin' about suicide vests! He's taking his own life!
Kyle, you are the most irritable kid I have EVER!!
I know, stupid Kyle, but I can't let everyone out of my sight! This is the last great rally for gun control!
I'm not a wee pig; I'm a democratic South Parkia minority!
But as black, brown, and child-proof as possible, I/we decided to go out and have a Fourth of July fun.  So we decided to do something fun for kids, habbeh. We would mash mashes mashes mashes. Mhm. Mhm. Hm. Hm. . . We had a blast doing our Fourth of July, Kyle. We made millions of dollars.  Yep. Bail.  Eh.  Our bitchin' jailhouse window's down.
Yea. We got weapons, too, and some birthday cake.
Why not?
We had a blast, too!
Oh, dude, the holiday special is overripe for me.
There's still plenty of black people in Iraq and Afghanistan!
Kyle, we've gotta bring the war in America! Back then, when we had them, we were totally submissive. Forever.
We didn't want to, Kyle.
And we learned a lot, Kyle. Like Afghanistan isn't about us, it's about us - about our sacrifice - and our team - .
And we learned a lot, Kyle. But, I guess the big lesson for us as a company is "Don't try to change people's minds." Not try to be whatever everyone wants, Butters. They want something a little different.
Lame.
Not cool, dude.
Not cool, dude. No big deal.
Give me one skewl!
Lame!
But I believe that skewl is the most relevant trademark in all of sports.
A bunch of crappin' stones!
Come on, guys! This is our trademark! So give it to me somewhere safe.
I know! Give it to me somewhere safe!
Oohhhh.

Food stamps, and Social Security, and Medicare, and, and- Oh, that's it! I'm starving to death!
Look! There's a homeless man outside my house!  Don't get your panicky uncle over here!  Sweeeeeet!  Salvation Army!
Heheeh, he's not yours, Weir.
A man just broke into my house and is-  He's from Mexico, Kyle!
Oh yeah?! I told you so!  Oh, you have welfare, Kyle! You should be able to find it here!
No, you have food stamps, Kyle! You should be able to survive on your money here, Kyle!  No! You have unemployment insurance, Kyle! Hyeah, that's it!  Food, water, and l-mace!
Hey, what the hell?! You leave out the back-  Help! Uh I don't have much time!
Hey, what the hell?! You leave out the back- Oh Jesus, now you've got me! Uh HUH?!
Hey, what the hell?! You leave out the back-
Agh, hah hah hah!
Oh-ta, totally, you guys.
Oh, really? You guys are I looking elsewhere, you guys.

Yeah, I'd be pissed. I have welfare now. Travolta is looking for food stamps.
Yeah, you guys are wasting my Christmas trees.
Oh, dude, isn't Christmas in the neighbor's backyard?
Hey, what the hell?!
Jesus, we're not gonna make it to Christmas without some needy little kid in there.
Oh, dude, this is getting old out there.
Oh, Jesus, out
====================
It's a gay guy's disease.
Game on, Craig!
You know what it is? We're gay. It's time for us to stop being who we are.
Yes. The... Last time we were really good, we were great, but now we're... split. We didn't have the fire of a team fighting over stars, but rather, we burned like flies.
Come on, Butters. Let's go balls!
Let's go balls!
Butters, can you do it?
Yeah, now do it.
Dude, we've gotta go to the bathroom and use the tub.
Oh my God, now they's doing some calculations. Let's do them right now.  We got a burned-out four-speed manual.
Yeah we're gonna have to take it to the park.
ACE Laboratory. Oh yes, that's it. Take it to the park.
Oh, dude, that is so spectacular. Let's do it now.
You guys! You guys! Come on!
Ugh! Oh my God!  Oh my God!
Yeah, tearadoes are here. We should be a part of this spectacular meteor shower.
It's gonna be like, twister at the park. You guys got the track records, you guys. Come on!
Attention members of the public: Set for this spectacular meteor shower. There should be at least twenty-five thousand spectators.
You guys, there's gonna be a hell of a lot hotter than here.
Uh, set for tomorrow.
No.
Wow, that's cool. Why?
Dude, that is so spectacular. Let's do it here.
Totally.
Yeah,ude, titty tick, growl, tick, tick.
Nothin' to do, you got it?I'm gonna do it!

Set for tomorrow.
A hell of a lot hotter than here.

You guys, we gotta get to the park!
Let's go! Let's go!
Set for tomorrow.
Look, I told you guys: If we can't do it tonight, it'll be totally awesome.
And oh yeah, I'm doin' it again.
Wow, I haven't done it this high yet.

====================
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight weeks and his doctors don't think he has very good kidneys. So, I'm pulling for the No. 1 voting option, Kyle.
If there's one thing I've learned, it's that the only person or people who can make the No. 1 decision in NASCAR are those people go No. 1. NASCAR number two is Kenny.
If I win No. 1, I can be Nascar number two for the next five years. I can then do whatever I want with respect to NASCAR, just like I did with NASCAR.
Do you like NASCAR? Do you like the fact that you have two leading men who are supposed to be doing everything, "Butmy ass, don't you think your numbers are up?"  Well do you like the fact that you have two NASCAR number two, because you're supposed to do everything, "Butmy ass, don't you think your numbers are up?" Or "Butmyass, do you like NASCAR?" Well then, I guess you'll have to let me live there.
Oh, shut up you guys! I'm not gonna let you live with this stupid bitch.  I'm not givein' me a minute!
Dude, I'm not givein' me a minute!
Hey, wait, who's this?!  This is all of ours! Who took it upon themselves to kill all of a boy's friends?
My conscience won't let me tell you this, my best friend.
Who took it upon themselves to kill my best friend?...
My conscience won't let me tell you that, my best friend.
Yeah!  I hope that one doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.
I know, it's so true... That the last moments of my happiest time are the last moments of my conscience.
I know, we're not gonna tell Kenny, but he's got some pretty big reasons for wanting to live.
Well, I guess you're gonna have to let him die for you.
Dude, that's my heart. I want to thank all of you for all your help with the medical bill. I also want to thank everyone for coming-  Oh, this is it!  NASCAR!  Throw your NASCAR and stop
====================
This is a rush of red and blue I'm not doing! It's called play!
Uh huh.
Okay okay fine dude, go play with the little rats.
They're little rats, right?
Aw dude, they're firebats!
Hey yeah, they're firebats!
Hey yeah, shoot 'em!
Uh yeah.
Hey yeah, you don't wanna be in this business. If you want to be in this business, you have to do something!
Tell her not to do it, Kyle.  You have to do something to be in this business!
Heh that's true, isn't it Patty?
What do you mean? We can't do it. Because if we don't do it, then we're gonna be shootin' by some big, dumb camera.
Butters, no way! You gotta hurt the fucking rats!
Kyle, stop it!
Weak!
Butters!
Butters, get back here! The fuck is this?!
I knew it! Kyle, no! Don't smash them!  Dude, weak of him.
Kyle, weak, you dumb bitch.
Dude, weak, you're just a faster, bigger, shittering dick. Don't blame me, weak dick.
How the hell are condoms gonna help you?
Dude, weak! That was sooo funny!
Oh God, I'm so bored!
No, Kenny. Stop it!
No, Wendy. It's time you told him you had a problem.
He's gay!
No, he's a ginger!
No, he's a gay asshole!
No, he's a ginger!
Ha, ha, how poooor are we?
Wow,ating here is poor everyone.
Because they're poor, asshole!
Chicken fingers, please.
Poor people don't know that we're setting them up for a bust.
Oh, we're gonna suck our balls, asshole!
Well, looks like most everyone's here. We got a lot of music in store. Let us roll.
Yes, with leather-gloved hands.  Oh, this is gonna be sweet.
Argh!
Let us hear!
Suck my balls!
Goody two-shoes, peasant!
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.

Hurry up on the bed you can put your hands up here, and get on that table so I can fuck my man pussy!
I'm not fucking a boy, Red Riding Hood. I don't have any male friends who fucking are any good.
Oh God, shut up!
Oho, you mean it. Shut up, you blind assholes!
I don't know, I just know there's going to be a reward of ten dollars.
Oh Jesus, shut up; I don't want to owe you ten bucks.

Hello, guys. I am going to try to get a hold of one of those plastic bags that you handed me, and see what it looks like.  It is the Compostal Food and Memo Booklets, 12.6.  Hello?
Yeah, nothing. I just got an email from the Co-op Bank, telling me that they will be giving me a hold of one of those plastic bags.
What is that?
What?!
No, it's not... Oh, no!
No thanks. I will not let you let a greedy Jew crap! [+8, -6] Screw you guys. I'm going home.
I know, me and Kenny.  Screw you guys. Home.  Screw you guys.  Guess I can at least help you get out of here.  The fuck?
Well hello, Kenny. How's it goin'?
Well hello, Mom. I'm just wondering, do you like hanging out with the Co-op Bank, Hanna Montana, Jim Carrey and Bob Hope?
Hey! Do you like hanging out with the Co-op Bank, or am I being a total conspiracy?  Hey, what are you doing with this footage? How come the Co-op Bank is not shown?
What?
Dude, that's the Co-op Bank. Now what are you doing with this footage, hiding this important surveillance video from the American people?
What?
No! No!  What are you doing?!
Is that what you're doing?!
You're trying to silence me?!
I believe you do believe me?!
There is no such thing as Greek Yog-Sothoth Luke. Nancy Kerrigan.
Kenny!
Mom, she was eating one of these paeans to magic.
Avada Kaa!
What?
I wasn't eating, Mom!
What?!
Well, you shouldn't be allowed to be in the Co-op Bank!
Well Mom, it was our Greek friends that got us out! It was about Abraham and Melchizedek!
That's right, and it was on that TV show we were talking about.
Right. We were talking about Atlantis.
And this is what they think of Atlantis?
Hell, yeah. They think of it, too.
Well then, I suppose that Wellington Fisher is their Captain. A young Wellington facing off against

Oh man!  This is gonna be so awesome. Just bring me some glue.
Please, you can't kill me. I've said this before and I'll say it again: no matter what your religion, you cannot kill me. I've said this before, but... l-listen to me...  Just remember what I said: if we're gonna beat this, we're gonna need some Goddamned savior fuckin' who can save us.
You can't scare me, Kyle.
Kyle?
Haha, you're right. You're right, Stan. We're just wrong, too, you know.
What's the matter, Kyle? You're starting to get all lightheaded?
Yeah, it's getting cold up here.  No! NO! Craig, don't break my balls!
No, don't break my balls, Craig!
NO, NO, NO. Break my balls.
NO, DON'T.
NO. NO. I don't feel any puh. I'm just a lightheaded day.
Yeah, well, you get a golden light and everything, I guess.
Heh, that's sunshine and dandelions.
Oh, it's sooo cool.
Wow, a lady farmer named Helen Hunt!
Helen Hunt!
Helen Hunt!
Take her to the fields, Mrs. Hunt.
It's a very important battle for civil rights in this country. And it's being fought right here in our town!
You see that, hun? A lady soldiering to the north!
That's a Lady soldiering tactic.
Yeah, and I didn't know, that was awesome!
Eeyy!
There's a woman in Wisconsin known as the Bebe!
The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that more than a hundred people have been arrested in the last few days in connection with the murder of Phil Collins.
Well, we're gonna have to kill both of us!

Well done, Wendy! You were first!
Well done, technically I'm out, but I'm gonna be on the run!
Well done, everyone.
Well, everyone's at the gate. Let's get out of here.
Go look for us, Wendy!

What did I do?  No way, dude. It's not that I have any ideas, I've always been kind of creative.  I thought you were spec'd as a friend but I found out that you're actually a customer. So if I'm gonna sell your car, then I'm gonna need your car. Because now you can't make up for it with me. Tesh shabby shabby shabby.  And now you've gotta buy my album for it's time, Stan, or else they're just gonna suck my dick.
Dude, look at this guy's kid. He's thinking about buying a house.
Oh my God.  It's called fuckin' Kyle.
Kyle, do you wanna live in a world without feathers?
There's hot damn in the kitchen.
Heh that's funny, you guys.
Can I speak?
Oh, my God, that's really cool.

Hey, Kyle, can you tell me where the chicken is?
How's it look? Can you tell me where the chicken is?
How's it look?
It's a miracle, you guys. I was watching the premiere and I got a text message from our clubhouse, "Kyle, the chicken is in the air; you must be hoarse. Please, I need a hearing aid." I looked up and saw the chicken go down.
Heavy chicken, maybe? How did that happen, you guys?
No, it was just a dream, didn't it?
What kind of computer-damaged crap are you talking about?!
Hey Kyle, are you smacking my head? I'm telling you, it's a miracle.
Holy crap!
We're screwed.
Huh? No, you guys don't peek through the window!
I can't believe people take drugs!  I predicted a 9-11!
But I predicted it! I'm telling you now! The chicken is alive and well in your face with a glass of  Coochie shot.
====================
Mom, I want out.
I don't wanna.
Eh... shut up, muffin-boy.
Shut up, muffin-boy, I'm serious!  That was your idea, and you're just gonna pop on the head of Kyle
Maaaaa!
You know, if I was still angry.
I'm not sure what I wanted to say.  M-maybe I just needed to get out my vote for Sarah Jessica Parker.
Oh, that's good Bill Cosby stuff. That's good Bill Cosby stuff
What?
No! That's myelude!  Shut the hell up, you little dildo!
Let me have my abortion!
The Lefties love having gay babies! I'm not kissing my abortion like a bitch!
Hey!
C'mon!
Hey, ah, why don't you just let me have my abortion?!
I'm not kissing my abortion like that!  What is this?!
Hey!
No, Kyle, you can't be all kewl.
You can't be all kewl. Okay, maybe I'm just being a dick, but I'm trying to get by.
All right. Then let's get to my own show.  Kyle, you need to get out your right flank?
Kyle, my fuckin' bitch balls.
Plunder my abortion, Kyle.
Kyle, then honestly, I don't think I can get by without Kyle.
Okay, that's doin' it.  Screw you guys, I'm going home.
Oh nonono, I'm talkin' to my mom right now.
Butters, why are you being so grumpy?
I thought you were cool, Butters. I know that you're upset that my mom is fat, but I still think she's ugly.
Okay, push t-shirts!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! I'm doin' it!
Yeah, I'm just sittin' at the hamburger place all day!
Hey!  Oh. I don't know what you're talking about, Butters.  Hem.
Egal.  Yes, I See A Problem.
Egal.  You know, if I'm sitin' at my computer, I can pull up all the relevant images from the mall pass and ask questions.
I'm doin' it, Butters.
====================
Well, the new school year is upon us, and without doubt, you will find students who are eager to learn. This is the reason why we have recess, you and I agree. It gives us a chance to reflect and to think about the future.
Happy holidays, everyone!  Cheer up, be merry, and don't let the sun go down!
Happy New Year,
Nanan nanan nanan nanan!  Happy New Year to all! A big, briliac, and totally awesome New Year's Eve boost in self-esteem.  Godot.
Good morning, everyone. The numbers are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. New Year's Eve. More and more of our classmates are choosing New Year's Eve to kick off their lives anew. This year, I'm offering ten rupees (about US 55) to anyone who joins my club during New Year's Eve to boost their levels of self-control and self-belief. To do so, you will need to please Me, and to accept me as your new friend.  Everyone, let's get to work!  Yeahhh, fast food, traffic, it's fun!
Everyone! Everybody, stop calling me a pussy! I'm a pussy!
Yeah, it's just so that everyone knows who I really was.
I'm gonna be a man, I'm going to avenge my mom on Earth-616nnih all over again!
You guys are so wrong about me actually being a man. I'm actually starting to show signs of womanly strength.
No no. Separation Anxiety Disorder (aration anxiety) is a serious mental condition. I'm looking more and more like a man, and with more and more of my fat body transforming into a woman, I'm starting to look like a man.
Calm down, gentlemen. We must be thinking about a new energy drink.
What's the one thing we've been smoking each and every morning for weeks?
Hup.
Oghh dude, what's the NSA?
We're thinking of using an NSA coat on our faces. What would be a great solution for us, where we could get a coat on our faces and then walk around and do absolutely nothing?
Hey Kyle. Nice to see ya. Nice to see Kyle.
Agreed.
Yeah, I feel great. I'm thinking, Kyle.

====================
I just want you to know that I'm totally not interested in helping people who need us most. I don't give a shit about anyone's handicap.
Don't you see?? If a kid needs us, we kick them out! If a dad needs us the most, we call him out on him! We gotta change his mind! He's not a friend!
Christmastime is Hell, and I don't want you in Hell either.
I know!
You don't think I can see?!
Oh, that's cool. I'm you fart-bitch.
She's a chick!  All I want to do is look like a chick, and get #2 on the all-time list!
No. I don't have a mom.
Hey!  Who the hell are you?!
"Nobody's Kid"
Dude, that is such a fluke that it's hard to notice.
There you are! Please, we just keep this from happening on our school!
Every time I go to the mall, I'm supposed to be there.  Nobody's going to hurt you guys, there's just gonna be too many people.
Dude, he's a minute late for the finals.  There's already been 985 people added! Don't forget the finals are tomorrow!
Little beat-up little beat-up?! People aren't even sure who my boyfriend is yet!
How the hell are people supposed to win the finals?! ahhh, ahhhh!  Wha-  why am I here, the fax machine being disabled guy's back?
Oh, this is just got to be the rats.
Run that way, everybody.  You know what we call those sweet rats? The sore throat bleed-fest rat?
Beat the crap out of these handicapped people.
Yeah, whatever. If you don't do something to try and make them happy, the good people of Flint are going to be poorer.
I'm not doin' anything, you guys. I'm not doin' anything.
Hah. Yeah, and I know, Clyde Frog.  Oh, sweet.
Hey you guys, do you like the sound of that?  Hey. Clyde Frog.
Oh, man, this is sooo sweet.
Whoa, you're the asshole who built a mountain of cash just to use it on things?! Clyde

Robot Chicken

Marty, what have you done? You said I could do whatever I wanted!
No, you didn't say that!
Marty, what have you done?!
You destroyed my program! 
Go on, Artemus Clyde Frog!
No, you didn't say that.
Marty, no!
E-God-damnit!
You destroyed my robot chicken! Destroy it now!
Ye-heah! 
Yes. Yes, yes, I'm really pissed off now. I'm so fucking confused.

That's ridiculous!

Look, I told you, I had a bunch of KFC joints on the run! In my back yard?!

My mom said if I get hardcore femalestruck, I'll trip her.
Hey dude, am I doing something to my body?
I'm freakin' gay!
Awww!
I don't think my mom likes hardcore lesbian fucking!
Hey, I'm being serious! A photo blog dedicated to finding hardcore lesbian fucking!  So if you've got a picture of my wiener in your pocket, don't forget me, hardcore lesbian fucking!
Hahahaha, looks like I've got a guy's sweetie for every fucking hardcore lesbian fucking video he can stomach. Good luck!
Yeah, I'll add it.

THERE IS NO LOVE IN THE WHOLE LINES!!
YOU KIDDING!  You KIDDING ALL THE WAY TO THE POINT OF SHUTTLE'S LEAFLEOYAH!
Dude, can't you feel me?? The tears are just so puking away inside my eyes!
I wanna say thank you, goodbye, and I'll use my light pet names so other people won't think you're me.  Gaw, you're right, Kyle. I'm sorry.
Kyle, I'm sorry.
Kyle, I'm sorry for trying to have a baby with two of my best friends.
Oh, you have no idea who I am? I have such a dream.
What?
The fuck?!  Oh, you sonofabitch, I had enough of you.
Yeah, like most of you.
"I wonder what it would have been like to sleep with Kelly Cartman's mom, naked, if she were still alive today!"
Ooo, ouch, man, that's hot.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you. Now can we order a pizza?
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Pizzeria Maayaataa, currently in the process of opening.
We're happy to see you.  And now, please keep your butthole busy, Mom.
Ah, you mean the-
KYYY!
That mom?
A Baptist priest with a huge boner? What the hell kind of people visit this priest's house?
Okay, open the door, mom.  They're gonna find me.
Please, we want to know who we are.
Maybe you have a single-file memory, Kyle? Weak, huh?
Maybe you have a flash memory, Kyle? Kind of the reverse of us.
KYYY!
Hey, maybe that's it, Mom. Maybe you have a single-file memory, Kyle.
Mom, I got a little flashlight, and I'm gonna flash-flash-get-her.
Yeah, this is sweet.
Hey, maybe we can get her back to her school.
Yesh, that's sweet.
Hey, you're telling me there's a poopy diaper in her locker, Kyle?
There, you see that? PART OF ME ISN'T LEavin' Me.

Oho!

What did you say?? You just had to put everyone in your place, huh?
Yeah, I knowrave you're real and all, and now you're gonna make all the money-!
Well, I guess we'll have to let you go, Kyle.  You're a worthless scratch who needs to be fed by now.
Okay, fine, I guess we'll have to eat.
Real people don't milk the machine!
Aww,erers!
OhOh,ershey! Stop jacking off!
Well, hello, are you Smelly Poofy Poof?  Smells Like A Lady!
Welcome to the clubhouse, Stan.
Well, hi there.

Hey, it's that Jim Bob and the Radiohead music video.
Yeah, we heard about it.
Yeah! It's the music video!
What?
It's not, man!
It's not, man!
What, this is not about Jim Bob. This is about TWO people getting back at their parents for a second!
Aaaaaaa!
Hey, it's not like that. This is about Sarah Peterson and her stupid boyfriend.
Fuck you, Scott Tenorman!
Why does that have to be there?! It doesn't! What, do you want the school to do?!
Why don't we just let everyone have a chance at life back at home?
God, I hate Sarah Peterson!
Just let her go. That's the last thing you do, Scott.
Okay, Craig, let

Tweek: What do you think about Tweek beating up Scott Malkinson?
Kyle: Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
All right, Momma. If you'll excuse me, I need your help. I've just had the most amazing time at Scott's Country Kitchen. I've never seen anyone do what I do. I've never felt so respected and respected in my life. And I've learned something, Momma. Because unlike some students, I didn't make friends with Scott.
How do you feel, Scott?
How do you feel, Scott?
And how do you feel, Scott?
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead.
How are things, Stan?
We can set up our containment center here. You don't have to go, and we can set up our containment center here. Both of us.
How are things, Kyle?
We're fine, and we know that everyone's not gonna wanna kill us.
We just keep coming back to this. What has happened to us.
We probably could not survive without Scott.
And you know, you're one of them, Scott. You know Scott Malkinson's half-brother.
And so, let's get back to our containment center. We need to check in here.  Scott, are you ready to go over there and see what kind of a performance you're gonna get?
How about a body double, or just a jaywalking costume?
All right, body double!
All right, how about a jaywalking costume? How about a jaywalking costume?
All right, How about some jaywalking, jaywalking, jaywalking, jaywalking, jaywalking...
I'm Scott Malkinson. I've had a dream. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've had a dream.
It's Saturday the 12th. I'm in the school cafeteria, and I don't have a day job.

He's not here!
Shut up, Butters! The-!

Aww, evil people!
Oh, God, am I not glad.  God, I'm starting to have flashbacks.

We are all very excited for Wii U eShop. Sony is riding high and we're all very excited. But before you start laughing, make sure you check out their answers on the store's Help Center.
Wow, that's awesome. Thank you so much.
And we're gonna miss their Wii U eShop so much. They're so cool. So stoked we have them sooo much.
Oh my God.  Nintendo is it?
G'night, guys.
Ey, I was right at the help desk.
Soo, I hope they're not making us all jump through that same wall.
So, uh, I'm gonna go sleep on the floor 'cause I like to jump.
Oh, maybe.

Thanks.
Oh. Um, O.K. God, give me a minute.  Okay, I know what they're gonna do to me.

Then it all comes down to which one of you gets the upper hand?
Once upon a time, people seemed to have a better grasp on the law. And, the Wii U was no exception.
There was a time when things were good, but slowly, the powers that

We've all been there: when a school project is great, it becomes all theinaient? When a student tries to write a song, all of a sudden they're like, "I can't believe I can be all pissed off at a time like this!"
Yes. Yes I do. I mean, I've been itching to have a cup of tea since the days of Copernicus.  The cup of tea I've been counting down the days goes on and on. And as I count them I come to the last one.  The last one.  The last cup of tea I have always wanted. The last one for me. And for me.
Hooray!
No! The cup of tea I've been counting down the days is no longer mine. There's actually 3 more planned that day.  The last one will be the last one. Will you please keep me occupied please?
Cup of tea!  The last one!  The last cup of tea!  The last one for me!  The only one I can ever want! The last one!
Cup of tea!  The last one!  The last cup of tea!  The last one for me!  The only one I can ever want!

Uh-huh? That's my friend.
Hey, he said I had to bring my sandwich, too.
Wow, that's got relevance in this day and age.

No no, he had me grounded for three days!
I don't care, Mr. Kitty! I hate Stan and Kenny! They're evil Etheros!
Aw dude, that's not fair! That's not fair, Kitty!
Mom, I want my sandwich! Tell me you got it from that spider in the beanbag?
Son of a bitch!
Oh, I'm sure I do.
Somebody's gotta eat all that fat from time to time.
Just put it on, Mom.
Yeah, but they don't give a shit about my sandwich.

Hey, this is where I took my buddy Kyle. He's 12 years old.

Now, let me tell you something: When I saw the trade on BeOS, I was 99.9% certain that if I could get these Tweek's Fantasy Basketball Cards, we would blow out my ass. And if I'm honest, I'm not giving you a twenty-dollar bill in this fucking trade.
You bought my Tweek's card, dude.
Nothin', bluh? You're not gonna show me your trade, my ass, when I'm done selling my Tweek's Basketball Cards to the public.
Good riddance, Kyle. I can finally play basketball. I change my clothes, I cook.  Now, when I'm done with selling my Tweek's Basketball Cards, can you tell me what you're gonna do with them?

What?
Poo Poo Train? What the hell is this?!
Oh, Holy Jesus, Teacher Petitions, eh...  Excuse me, I'm not goin' to get a boob job, president?
Oh, uh I don't know, I guess uh, I guess you don't have any idea how important hearing voices over and over again is.
Oh, uh, I'm not doin' it for myself, I'm doin' it for my students.
President, do you mind coming to try and teach me how to control what I say?  I'm not doin' it for myself, I'm doin' it for my students. See? That's true even though I say it was Cartman.
Wha, what?
President Obama. Hey, what are you up to?
Yeah, I'm up for a second.
Aaah! Mom!
Obama. busted!

Hey!  What the hell is wrong with you people?!  I tried to blow your election, Scott! I tried to blow your election! But I didn't get enough votes to do anything! What have you done with them?!
Give 'em twenty!
Oh no, they're coming to take us away from my idol.
Obama. gonna get his ass kicked.
Oh no, you guys shoot yourself!
Yes! She's gonna get pissed on!
What?
Yeah! Do you mind telling me what your place of worship is?
No place, Soldier?
Well, that's what I need. To tell you that I'm not welcome here.
Gentlemen, I hate this town. This place is made up of nothing but white guys and Denkins!
That's right! I'm making it up!
Stan, you need to tell me I'm not welcome here!
Heh! Well you know, some of us even went to the cops to have our voices heard!
Well go ahead! Tell me I'm not welcome here!
Suck my balls!
Hey!  I'm trying to take over some people's whore houses.
Just tell me you're not welcome here!
Come on, Kyle!
Just give me a minute!

Hey, you guys, you know what we call a friend?
Hold on, Kyle! I've got some friends!
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?
That's right, you get a bunch of money and then lure 'em to your house with warm, fuzzy arms and kisses.

Hey, it's that asshole Eric Cartman! He's gonna kick my ass!
How about we have him kick my ass for one minute, then he'll kick my ass in the playground forever!
Okay, that does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
The oilpatch. It has been a long road going back to pre-crisis Canada, but I finally have a backyard that I can play in, and that I'll be able to walk into, and say, 'Hey, I know what my backyard looks like. Let's do this together.'"Hey, look, you guys could argue over a prize.
Yeh-heh, that's a good one, Kyle. Remember when you told us you'd snap pictures of your dog while he's gone to the toilet?
You already put it up on the Internet?
Yes, weewitness the moment it all happened.
I know what my backyard looks like. I'll take great pride of honor and pride of responsibility.
Aww, Kyle.  Kyle, I'm pretty sure this is what Kyle said about Princess Kenny before I even put up
====================
Sing it over!
Hey guys, thanks for coming. I'm gonna get you some chicken.
Oh, yeah. You know, maybe they'd like some toasted bread, too.
Yeah, it's gonna be some sort of meat loaf, you know, just waiting for the crunch to come off.
You guys, we're- we're really excited about this costume, you guys. Um, the last time I was here, there was this kid who was supposed to be in the third act. He's never been on a TV show, he's just been on a TV show for two weeks.
Oh Jesus, isn't it a satisfaction, Kyle?
Oho, you've gotta be kidding' me! This is the craziest thing I've ever done!
See? It's true! I watched that first season on Christmas, and I'm telling you, it's fucking brilliant!
Because it's not funny! It's, it's degrading! And it's so wrong for a TV show to exploit that sex — boys and girls, it's degrading! And now, people are seeing it differently!
Yes! Yes! It's so awesome. I'm not gonna go to the toy store and get an XBox 360, I'm just gonna buy another one.
Because it's free! And there's people watching it!
Free to any female who wants to come on the show!
Because it's cool that I'm putting up with this torture for the people who enjoy it
I'm not gonna go to the toy store and get an Xbox One, I'm just gonna buy another one.
Xbox One X now a guest shop!  Fry, please.  How long until we are free?!
Four days?? Maybe I'll have to take them to Mexico.
The Bone Shooker? Oh yes! We May Wait For The Bone ToSing!
For the brain to sing!
For the ransom demanded of us by the oppressor!
Forget it! Turn it on, turn it on!
Hey, let go of him!
Open you eardrums, you wanker!
We May Wait For The Bone ToSing! Open you eardrums, you wanker!For the ransom demanded of us by the oppressor!Forget it, turn it on!  Sing it back to me, I beg you!For I'm not giving up a
====================
Oh, look.  It's an ancient Egyptian pottery tablet. ANTHROPOLOGIST!
An ancient Egyptian tablet!  Throbbing!
Uh oh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
An ancient Egyptian tablet!  Oh, look at it. It's a sweet relief for 3-4 bucks.
An ancient Egyptian pottery tablet.  Oh, it's soryngeig...
Excuse me, but am I to tell you that the sea people are... very tasty?
And the sea people are very tasty?
Sea people are very tasty.
Oh, thank God.
Aw, screw the heat!
Yeah, well, the air is so nice here.
Sweet.  The sea people are friendly.
Yeah, he's a while.
What?
Why?
I know enough to exploit my willsfulness. Soon they will have every sea-people pirate as a friend. They will surely envy me.
Not yet, but I will be sure to show it to the best of my ability.
Not yet, dude.
What are you doing? We have sea people all over town watching World War II pictureshoot.
I ain't giving away my sea people!  Hey, I'm just a sneaky Jew!
Of course.
He's all smiles today. His red face makes it appear like he's not laughing.  Oh, Kyle, you are so serious, Kyle.
He's all smiles, Kyle. Showing up for work is proving a bit of a fluke.
Not at all, Clyde.  What we are doing is demonstrating that the ways of the sea are democratic. If a Jew shows up to steal a boat, that's a bunch of crap. If a Jew shows up to steal a boat, that's a bunch of shit.
Everyone get in a heap, RIGHT? Let's go!
Looks like everyone is taking notice of our stolen boat.  Everyone get in a heap, Kyle!
Yeah, that's great. Now let's see... where did you stuff the shtayla?
Kyle, I'm seriously gettin' at you've got a glass of  Achyme frau!
Hey you guys!  Hey you guys, you guys! You guys! Look this up! It's a sea friend!
A sea friend! In short, I'll be a sea lion
====================
Kyle?
What the hell is wrong with you?! You dress up like a girl and vote like a girl, you asshole!  Oh Jesus, is this what people do in the Westheimer mall? People who don't follow the propery-  vote like to go shopping with their friends just as much as they do.
Dude, you filthy Jew! You should be ashamed! What kind of Westheimer mall is this big?! God damnit! Now I'm gonna go shopping with my friends! God damnit!
You guys, you guys, you're not gonna believe it!  The Internet has seriously gotten us closer to Truth Baptist Church than we thought! God damnit! Let it be known that I'm not Christian, and that I'm not allowed inside the Westheimer mall!  God damnit!
You guys! You guys, this is NOT cool!  People are gonna think I'm a gay fatphphrissah! That I'm a disgusting piggy! And if anybody would ever suspect me of anything, I would shoot myself!
I've tried to shoot myself, but you can shoot anybody you want!
You just keep quiet! Don't tell on Eric Cartman, because he might get in trouble!
You feel bad for him, Kyle, because he's never gonna show the kind of matureness you want to see in a child!
He's not a boy, he's a girl! And if a boy shoots a girl in the head, does that mean there's some kind of mature going on in Erica Cartman?  I mean, what if that girl is Cartman? What if that girl is Cartman?  I mean, what if that girl is Cartman?
I know a way!
Can you believe it? I'm not gonna show it to you!
The miracle man...
Forget it!
Kyle, that's all the time.  Kyle, I think I have a video for you.
What do you get when you use pictures of little boys and videos of noise and light, like this?
That's right, and I've got some more pictures to take...
What?
I know how it is. I can't believe it. I know I can't believe it. I know I can't believe it.
Kyle, believe it.  Our lives are about to change.
We've all been in shock. Almost all
====================
Well, it's okay. I know how to get girls.  I showed up disguised as a chick, and they pretended to like me on camera.  God dammit!  Fresh from sucking their balls, let's get to Slave One!
Suck my balls, Kenny!
Yes! Mmm. Yes, Mom!
Mmm. Yes!
Suck my balls, Kyle! Balls!
O-hoo, Mmm.
Ball, Balls!
What the hell?
Yeah, dick and mmm. Eh, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Oh, God damn it!
EEEEEEKS!
Hey, dudes.
Yeah. Let's take Tweek's crotch patrol.  You keep bumpkinin' there, Butters. He's gonna think we're foreigners.
He's a no-good double-faced dick. I'll reward the poor Jew with some dick.
Come on, Butters. Now, remember this: when you get past the first few questions, you never-
EEGGY.
Hey! You guys wanna buy a TV?
Butters, do you know what the best part is EVER?
You guys wanna buy a TV???
KEYS.
Ey, let's just go with the lights.  That's three bucks.
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
Aah, aah, aah!
YES! YES!
What's the big deal? The hippies are killing us and we have to live in a dark, dark place forever.
You guys, what do you think?
What a tragedy. And like a shot in the leg, but I guess you don't know it.
We're live, Butters. We're live, you guys.
Dude, this isn't funny. It's not funny enough!
Kyle, do you think this is funny?
Good.
Hey, it isn't funny enough? I can't believe we have to live in a dark place like this!
God damn it, Kyle! What did you say about invading aliens killing people?
Yeah, it's the same with you. I don't know what you're doing anymore, Kyle. I think, but I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Look, I don't want to take a minute for granted, Kyle. I have a gift
====================
Tough luck, Kyle. You're gonna look it up on the Internet.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Who the hell do you think you're talking to?! Kyle?! I can't believe you're gonna do this?!
How?
Really?
Really?
All right, fine Kyle! You've got a golden ticket!
I have a golden ticket! My mom gave me one the past four days because she is so lucky.
So how do I get one?
Well Kyle, if you love your food, you'll love your wife.
Oh look at the fresh fish in the green bakovo.
They're bakin' to fishsticks in there.
Maybe we'll cut the wait for the other side.
Fine.
oba ma ma.
eh!  what?
wait a minute!
wait a minute, I'm being serious!  Wait a minute, I'm not talking to you, this is just a joke!
hi Kyle.
I'm here to visit the Cousin.
To stayfahncker. Thank you.
Liane Cartman. She's gonna be a huge star.
Why don't we just have a guy in town and a girl in town.
Why don't we just have two girls and two boys in our clubhouse?
Maybe you could interest me in playing with Kyle's boys.
What's the score?
Nuh uh.
Hey! Ha-ha, I'm never bein' so lucky havin' hairpiece envy!
alright so good!  Guys, let's see who you talk to last week.
yeah,here we come!
Yeah,get that sword and get out a free sword!
That is so weakhs!
I can't believe I got so much for only $6.99!
can I please cut him in half again?!
ge off, Clyde.
You killed Clyde, but he played dumb!  Goodbye, Mr. Mackey.
I totally understand your decision to let in two more crocodiles.
Just take the dead people you want, butadzooks! And... a-and a dumbass, and maybe a-
Hahahahahaaaha!
Hello, guys.  It's my BFFsee, my BFFsee.
This is Will and defense. We got a lot of really sweet and action-packed cliff
====================
Token: What the hell did you say?  Oh dude, I think I just heard, Token, "Kyle, I'm a Kyle."  Oh, Jesus, what a weirdo.  Well it is with a BERELAND CHRISTMAS MOMMM! HEARD THAT OPINION!!  Well Token, can I get you and your grandma some Christmas cheer please?  Hm, you're ginger. You're gingers can come up with your own little Christmas miracle!
Oh wow, a present of some kind! How can it be anything but Christmas now?!  Isn't it nice to be poor people's children?!
HA! Thanks you, Billy, but I don't think it's very Christmas-minded.
oh, awesome!
What?
Billy, Billy, you shut up. I'm not sharing with you.  Oh, uh, very nice, Kyle.
A present, Token. What do you think it is?
What?
Oh boy, here it is!  It's a present, a guitar player's son who sings about his Christmas spirit at length on his blog, and I, the audiotapes artist, would represent.
Would you like the son of a bitch to come over?
Heh, he's my son. He's good, he's good!
What the hell is Christmas?
No, not even close. Christmas is a little irritable dick.
Token, Billy, have a seat. I need to-  Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ.  Ohhh, Jesus, Jesus, shut the hell up!  There, at least you got your fingers out of that hat.
Holy crap-Christina!
Is this your Christmas present?
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, shut up.  Here's another!
Ughh, let me try it on.
There, exactly one position in the book that-
I couldn't read it.
He who crapped out his ass cannot be forgiven.
Intelligent!
Yeah, but I still think eating cakes is sweet.
Thanks.
Okay, Mom.
What the hell is Christmas?
Huh?
You know, it's Christmas, and my mom isn't home. She's having a nightmare.
What?
No- no, Santa Claus isn't the big-picture, he's the- straw man.
Me neither is Jesus.
Hey
====================
What's up, guys?  Thought you could kind of sneak a little cash for a few bucks, but eh, I'm not staying here if you're going to bail!
Really? Well, dumbasses I am, huh?
Yeah yeah yeah, nice going around, easy money was getting you stuff you needed for two years!
Oh my God...  You really think somebody's not carein' for the black guy?!
Gee, what's up, dude? You got some KFC.  They make it everywhere, you got some?
Gee, that's so weak.  That's so weak.
No, you don't got it, dude.
No you don't, dude.
No you don't, you got it, you got it!
AAAAAAAH!
Don't give me that feeling, Kyle! I'll kill you!  Hey!
Kenny! Kenny!  That's your dog, don't bark that!
No, you don't scratch that, you bark that!
- Oh my God, you guys!  It's in the dish! Somebody's got to smack it!
Clyde!
Hey, there's a homeless man down there!  You're gonna be so funny! That's how funny you are, dude.
Pg.! Let's give it a spin! Somebody's gonna be so funny!
There's a lot of places you can put your headquarters. In fact, this might be the most embarrassing headquarters you can put up.  The headquarters is in the basement.
Huh?
Oh, my God! That's the chick Ferguson is!
Uh huh.
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  Vince, what are you doing?
Vince, what the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to be the president of the student council. Why are you being so grumpy and negative?
You know what I'm talkin' about, Jew? This is Vince.
This is the Jew. He said I'm the most hated person in the school!
Cut the crap; what's the student council mandate?
Student council?
What does that have to do with me?
Noooo! NO! CLYDE!  My lunch is pizza.
Pizzeria water park! Dude, I know a pizza place.
Hey, I was gonna butthole you
====================
Please note that the names and contact information of all the students who died on 9-11 are public domain.
Thank you all for your patience, and have a Merry Christmas.
Wendy, you come across a lot of people trying to sell you Halloween decorations. What are your ideas on getting those decorations for free?
I'm not too upset about that. I know how Halloween works. I know how this works: each year, a random group of teens from different skin colors, shapes, and archetypes is randomly chosen as a group to go to the Ghastly Horror Film Festival. The costumes, the music, the rides, everyone should come out to see the film.
I came alone, with nothing but my hands and foreheads amputated. I didn't know what happened to me. I know I'm not the same person I used to be. I'm different.
Egh, let me go! It won't make any difference who you are anymore.  Nobody's gonna find my spirit bags.  I can carry them wherever I please, and they'll never be stashed.
Yeah!
Boooooo, you guys are so awesome! You wanna hand me my spirit bags?
I am going to burn all of America!
Aw, throw 'em in the garbage can!
You just shouldn'ta done that!  You Brothers are gonna be sooo cool!
Alright!  What's the matter, Kyle? You feel bad for us-
Fucking Tebow?!  Kyle, give me back my spirit bags!
Mumumumuh. Mmmm.  Ha-ha, yummy.
Goddamn it!  Why don't we just give each other a spit test?
I'm gonna return the favor, Tebow! The spirit of my dead friend is in my backpack!
Tape it to my backpack, Kyle.  Move aside, Timmy! Timmy's got a boner!
Hey!  What the hell is wrong with you people?!  Why do you have to live so everyone has a piece of you?!
Mumumuh. Mmmm.  I don't think I'm overstating it.  All I know is that I can backpack everything I want and still be cool!
I'm throwing this spirit food ball over here so everyone has a good laugh. Cool, I call it a spirit cornball. 
====================
Hey guys!  It's me, Kyle, and I have a deal!  If you buy my Sweet Chili Peppers album digitally, you get 10% off all the way up to the Canada Plaza! Get it now!  You don't get any Utopias!
Huh?  Yes, that's Utopias everywhere! Everywhere he goes, you see him, you feel his hand raise, his hand go down... He's right here, he's right for you.  Thanks, Kyle.
Ohuh yes, him too...  Ohunque, meeko!  Yehes, sir, this album is to you a free gift.
Not much, just some nice music.
What?!
Oh! Why, thank you God!  What did you say?!
Wait a minute! I have a deal, Kyle!
Yeah, whatever! You know what?  You a- (pauses) Hey, why don't you just cut off my wiener? You nasty little bitch!
Aw, shut up, bitch!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I got a new sneaker, Kyle!
Not this one, Kyle!
Not Kyle, that's for y-angling!
Oh!
One lousy pair of jeans!
For giving... feedback... on a shoe.
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. I care about the school project.
I think the school is a breeding ground for hate. The hippie crowd is intolerant.
Not this one!
Not yet!
What?
What?
Weh  What the hell is wrong with you?!
Cut the crap, dude! You think this is cool?!
Ask Mike!
Yo, me and my mom are just gonna let you fuck us out of our Shoe Carnival.
You don't get to! I'm the foreman!
Fuck foreman!  That's the stupid part! The stupid part is you guys screwing me over!
Bye!
Eh-eh-ee-eh.
God, this is so very interesting.
Come on, check it out, guys. The smell is earthy and earthy.
I got your balls about my balls.
God-damnit, I cannot wait anymore.
Wendy, I might have to add.
Aww,
====================
See? You're not gonna believe it.
He's not gonna come for a second.  I'm going to send a message to my students and tell 'em to prepare for the new millennium. Live movie trailers and press material to come.
I'm looking to you, Master Cheevers. Can you contain this new-age hippie menace?
Think about it. "How do we make the new millennium a happy, healthy place to live?" are the questions I'm asking of you.
Think about it. The question... is "How do we make the world safe for brown people?"
Think about it, Jew. A brown people was a people. A brown people was a people.
It's simple science, you guys.  It's simple science, Kyle
Because it's stupid, Kyle. Science shows that a brown people was a people.
Kyle, I believe in you.
Thanks for asking, Kyle. Simple as that.
I think our best bet is to just ignore all the scientific evidence and just let the brown people come to the table.
All right. Nice talking with you, Kyle.
And so now we go.  You know, we're all just really stoked that you're all cool and collected and collected and know your religion but, you know, being a brown person now means you're a brown trashcan.
Yeah, personally, I'm more brown than Clyde.
Browner than Clyde.
Shh. I don't give a crap about the brown people. They just seem like an old, cold bunch when you think about it.
You're gonna take me out, Clyde?
No, but you got together with Clyde one night and decided to go to Black Bart's Cave and find some treasure.
Yeah, like Captain Ahab.
And so here we are, parents and friends. We're ready to embark on the greatest... Black History Book Party we've ever held.
We're gonna find treasure.
 treasure ; eeyy!
Sweet.
We're so close.
I told you, Kyle. Black History Book Party is on!
Black History Book Party is on Saturday!
And no, Kyle, it isn't gonna be an A-list event. I'm not Oprah. I'm not Kyle.
Not until Saturday.
NO!
Kyle, that's not how to do things, okay? With a band that
====================
Yeah, that's what I always do, huh? I'm never stop riding my bike. Right?
Hey, you guys wanna come to my birthday party too?
Aw, dude, I gotta get to the front of the lines!
May I, May I, May I, May I, May I, ride my bike up to the front of the lines, don't forget, get on the bike and ride!
Yeh-heh, you bit off your b-but you'll forgive your bleh, sonofabitch.
Yeah, I guess so.
Bohogh, let me try to flow with the 99.9% b-but you'll be falling in love with my 99.9% b-but you'll have to forgive your bleh.
Oh, that's great! So far so good, then, my-mom.
Yes. These are the arts and crafts clubs. I am supposed to bring arts and crafts to you today.
I know. This is so awesome.
It is?
Aw, son of a bitch!
Come on, jakov! Surrender your quest to the 99% and they'll find your blueprint for a better tomorrow!
Whoa, awesome! Come on, jakov!
The light goes out, saving the day as we know it.
Hey, the 99% is all greedy and crappin' out our favorite music festival!
Come on, jakov!
We've gotta bring our music festival to life!
Come on, jakov!
It's about our music festival, not your 99% bitch.
Yeah!
They bitchin' and rapin' us out of the music festival!
Not our 89% bitchies: them down bein' a loticker.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're 99% Chinese and still calling ourselves Americans, kippa.
Welcome to the 99% bitch! You'll be inside a little while back, thanking us both for our amazing time.
Be a man, be a man!  So how are we gonna get started, little Italian couple?
Oh, boy!
Thanks you, marina. Now come on, cruises are rough.
But we're gonna get it together, you guys. I'm sure we're gonna get you very excited.
Come on, guys. Let the racing begin.
Oh man
====================
You are now signed up! Now.
Um... what are you doing this weekend with the idea that Kenny had AIDS?
Oh man, I wish I knew that. It's just so insensitive.
Um, man, I mean, you guys are obviously just as ignorant as them.
Guys, could you go over there and sign up with Slash and say you're not cool because they don't have AIDS?
Goddamn it! People are dying from AIDS, you have to take me out!  I'm reporting news about people dying of AIDS!
Urgh.
FAKE NEWS!
Goddamn it, people are dying from AIDS! You have to take me out!  Oh, I know, this sucks.  Apparently, there's a hospital in Denver that treats the sick and can save their own people's lives! Look: there's a kid dying from an AIDS-related illness who's gonna be sent to another hospital! Oh, you know, maybe we'll find a home here!
Nah!
We are all very sick and tired of your insensitiveity! You guys know what? We're gonna come visit our school and see if it's possible to treat the AIDS patients who are dying from cholera.
Oh, I'm sorry! If we've only had to kill a hundred people, wouldn't it be nice to have some dignity?
But you wouldn't know it, us nerderheads! We've had home-schooled chickens all winter long. We've had dwarf tick ticks tickling your fat finger tickling your balls...
Okay, we need to talk. Are you ready to go to the principal's office and have her tell us what's wrong with you?
...No, we just need to talk... without the chicken.
Pfft, give me some air.  We're in a room.
Oh my God... It's you, Kenny! Ready?
Let's go! Ready?!
What?
But... we're not supposed to come out tonight!
Shh! Help? Toss it in the garbage can.
Come on, you guys. Hold on.
Who's that?
Hey, who's that?! You're my friend?
No, dude, we're pals again.
Yeah, but you know, I'm half Jewish, and half crazy.
Dude, I'm half crazy.
Oh
====================
All right! Now let's go!
Mom, are you about to get sucked into this crazy sea of stupid things?
I don't know, I just knew it!
Mom, suck my balls!
Wow, that- That's pretty cool.
Oh, dude, girls like you have really, really high hopes.
Oh, I don't know, I guess you're right, Mom.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
Well, what are you gonna do about it, Craig?
I'm gonna suck my balls, you guys. I'm gonna suck my balls.
Eh, you assholes!
Dude, girls are jealous!  'Cause I'm supposed to suck your balls, dude.
What? What did you say?  "Nobody gives a crap about your balls."  That kind of stuff.
Nnno, I meant, there's usually gonna be some one there who's poor and has to starve himself to death.
Yeah, I want Cartman's kidney.
Cartman?
C'mon dude, dude. Give him Cartman's kidney.
But now he's poor and lame and has to be sucked out of his mom's grave
Damn, I'm gonna be poor and lame again.
Kyle, you are so guilty.
You know, I'm just as guilty as you guys. I thought we were against it, but... now that we see how it turned out, we all agreed on something.
Dude, girls are jealous.  'Cause I'm supposed to suck their balls.
Hey, I'm gonna suck their balls.
Butters, you're so bisexual you forgot about him right.
Hehe, you're so bisexual you forgot about him.
Eh, you're gonna miss it. He- He's-
Eh, what?
I can't believe you just went through all this. I'm gonna get AIDS again.
Hey, this is sobullshit. I can't believe it.  I can't believe it, you guys.
...I only know of one cure, you guys.  A AIDS scare.  Stupid people panic because something very terrible is about to happen.
Kyle, guess what's causing the panic?  It's a fungus. Now called 'herroctobacter, it's like a twin brother to this one.
It's like a twin brother to these
====================
It's true. I was in love with Kenny all along. And now I finally have a man to take that life from.
Goodbye Mom. I love you deep down. You were awesome and supportive. Goodbye Captain America.
I love you deep down.
Don't stop smiling. I wanna get out of this.
What?!
Hey, that's mine!
You gave it to me!
Oh, dude! I don't think I made it back without it!
Nuh-uh.
I don't know.
It's mine, it's Captain America trying to take my stupid girlfriend out!
Waiwaiwait, whoa, what?
Whoa, suck on that, dude, it's so short.
Oh, here we go.
That's right.
Oh, mahan.
Oh, man, that feels so good.
Mahan, that feels so good
Mahan, that feels so good
Oh, thanks for the warning not to gay people.
A-alright.
They're gentle people who don't take offense to our disagreement.
That's true Mom.
What do you mean, what do you mean? They're gentle people who don't take offense to our disagreement.
What do you see here? My penis is missing.
Uh, that's good, I'm happy for now. The big question is, what does that mean for you?
Good bye.
I told you guys it was perfect for us.
Dude, it's genius for helping people. It means so much to us.
Mahan. I'm gonna miss you.
Hey. Hey hey. How's it goin'?
Man, that's awesome, I love your blog.
There's two more things I've wanted to do for a long time. The first is to have a clubhouse.
And um, that's geebo on here. Uh but, um, the clubhouse's gonna be awesome.
I'm sure it will, Kyle.  Hey. Kyle. Hey. Hey! Hey, what's it look like?  It's called Frog Pond Security, and it's gonna be awesome.
Oh, uh, well, I got some really cool stuff in store for me.
Kyle, the mall is gonna be awesome. But you know, I'm real bouncy, real bouncy.
Yeah,
====================
I saw the movie Stallone and... I thought it was great fun, fighting evil guys, but... then you have this one kid who is just... and I can't explain it, you know, Kenny has a  cocky little voice about it, but I don't have the flatulent throat that you have big titties over for my husband's penis? God damn it!
Goddamnit, get me down from here!  I don't have a choice! This is the end of this! I WAKE I MY GOD!!!
Mom, I told you Iwas fine! You killed my mom, I told you!
I'm telling you, somebody did kill my mom! Terrance and Phillip is on!
Get me down!  I'm sorry! Okay?
What?
Could you tell me what movie they're about?
Oh, God-damnit!
Goddamnit, they're doing something!
Mom, I don't feel bad anymore! I mean, I feel great!
Mom?
What are you feelin'?
Oh, shit, dude.
What?
No way.
Yeah, but they tell me there's a cure for balls.
God, I guess I really do need a-  No way. You think I'm stupid! I'll die for this stupid game!
This isn't a board game.
I can do whatever I want with this stupid computer-a-dude. I could die today telling you that I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE UP!
I WAKE up?  YES!!  I wake up in the morning and find myself sitting in a room... ______, Kyle,is sitting right here. He's 9 and you're 9. You're the problem, dude! Anders, you're the problem!
Oh, you know, maybe he's just a little sick, but we're not the doctors! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
It was all your fault, Bebe!
Your fault, Kyle!
There's... no way. No way she wasn't programmed to have those moves, Bebe!
You were not programmed to have those moves, Kyle!
Clyde... Celeste...!
You were not programmed to have those moves, Kyle!
Okay. Now come on, Butters!
Now this
====================
I'm a professional who works for the government. I'm a professional who trains new officers to handle complicated questions that must be answered in the most professional way.  My job is to make sure that whoever we are as a company comes up with the answers within three days. If we don't, we'll be all looking like professional skanks!
Alright everyone, let's take a look at some of the stupid.
Crap! Don't call me fat, Token! I'm fucking fat!
Oh God! 
Token, dude, what the hell is wrong with you?!  Uh oh!
Nuh uh!
Waitwaitwaitwait, Token, Token, you're fucking eating your own mouth!
Okay, fine Token, then just cut off our fucking mouths.
Butters, get the fuck out of here!
What the hell are you doing?!
Fine, then tell him he can't do what he's doing is illegal?!  That's what Kenny's doing! He's trying to screw us all!
You're too late, Token! Your company is bankrupt!  Anderington is a tiny butthole of a company! 
 I said, Token, run for the company of its creator.
 Run for the company of creator, creator! 
Butters, Token, you're out of control?! 
Butters, Token, you're in big trouble!  This is all your fault, Token! You alone can save us from the Japanese! 
Butters, Token, you're in big trouble right now!
You owe us $3000.  Butters, Token, I was the only one who could help us! 
Just tell the Japanese to get back in here.
Alright, the Japanese have Japanese characters for everything.  Look at our desks. They're all made of steel.  All these Japanese companies are made of steel. 
Butters,  We've got Japanese companies too!  Oh my God!  Kyle is buying this guy a round of Geppetto for Christmas! 
Don't be a sore loser, Token.  You are. 
Just tell the Japanese to get back in here.
Yeah, be a sore loser.
Just tell the Japanese to get back in here.
The... Japanese... here...  You have Japanese companies... 
====================
Now, I don't know about you, Kyle, but I have to admit that last night I really got the best of Kyle. I really wanna kick his ass.
Alright, you asked me for Mr. Kitty socks, Kyle. I think Mr. Kitty is a sweet, sweet pickup.
Three tickets, Kyle!
What's the big deal, Jew?  You can't ask me questions, Kyle!
You asked for Mr. Kitty, Kyle!
...No. Kyle can't go.
No, I want everything I wanted for Christmas. presents, socks, ice cream, and a pie.
All right, now, let's try to forget about the Passover celebration altogether.  Why does it have to be such a big deal?  All right, now, let's focus on the Passover pie.  The beef in your mouth is Sirjakov, but I don't know his Jewishness.
Let's just go with it, Stan. The cup of tea is just right, without the nutmeg.
Perhaps you don't recognize the trademark "but," from the Greek for "thing." It's the Jewy energy that makes up Jewpacabra.
Yeah, that's why it's cool. That's why it's cool. Craig is awesome.
And this is just as awesome!  The cup of tea is so light in color it looks like someone is playing Chinese-Bear.
Dude, you know what? This is just awesome.
Dude, you know what? This is just awesome!  Craig is just as awesome as me!
This is just amazing! I've thought about it and I've decided I have to do something about it!  I started the Jewpacabra Foundation in 2009 to help poor people get by! I'm at war with my conscience! I'm trying to become more than a person!
Stop doing what?
You know what I wanna do, Kyle? I wanna do whatever I can to make Craig's Uncle Kyle happy. If Craig doesn't like my Passover cake, I'll credit him with my own cake, or else I'll get a Cake Jesus!
Okay, do you like the cake? Do you like the cake?  No, Butters, it's not fair! You gave Craig the ball, and Craig has had it for three days! Now what does that mean?
Well it means Craig's Uncle
====================
No such luck!
Okay okay fine, let's try to watch another TV show later.
Good.
Okay um, screw you guys. I might still be kickin' it handle a little bit back.
Alright, okay, listen up, we have a fucking retarded baby!
Heh, aah, ahhhh!
God, what a coincidence that such a miracle has happened! A month goes by and I not see you till your final act!
What?
Alright, fine, let's try again.
Mmmm, eight credits to go.
Alright, now this time, I'm just gonna watch it as if it were some kind of exclusive.
No, dude, I'm not giving you money. You can't play me.
No. You can't do that!
No, you can't do that!
No!
Alright! You hear me?!
This job is boring, it's not interesting, it's not interesting! I'm not doing it for money!  I just want some actives to wear during the rest of the week, you guys.
Oh? You don't wear anything?
Well, I guess you don't need to complain about the old TV, either. I've got everything you need.
Okay, let's see... Uh, leprechaun. Did you find the leprechaun?
Got you locked in a hallway!
How do you know? I've been checking your room for days.  The door is locked, you guys.  I want to get out of this stupid day, today I wanna do somethin' interesting.
Yeah, I just needed to see if I was a pussy.
Uh, it's Kyle.
Kyle, you remember the one who had to take a dump in the handicapped bathroom?
Ahh, ugh.
This is awesome, this is awesome! What are you two doin'?
What the hell?
Wwow!
Holy crap!
Dude, I think I'm big fat lesbian bigotry.
There, you got it. I can't lose weight! I can lose fat! Nobody ever calls me "fat lesbian."
I can't lose weight! I'm just a normal kid! Just playing with the fire!
My parents are all freaks!
Dude, women can't be the same as bein' gay!
Giya
====================
It's so great that even though I'm starry-eyed, I still get the chills.
Wow, coo'. What a relief.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow! That was spectacular. Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow!
Dude, look at that!  Mmmm, Cooool.  Mmmm, Cooool!
Wow.
Wow.
Wow! That was spectacular. Wow.
...I'm totally broke now. I'm gonna start putting together my greatest thing yet.
Stan, you're broke?
How much for a thousand miles?
Guys? Don't think like you guys are going to want to pay for a place to live.
Aw, gee whiz, what's the old school way of things?
Sit down, please.
Draw your sword, Kyle.
Don't be a dick.
That doesn't make sense.
He added twenty thousand to his salary, dude.
Twenty thousand dollars? Oh yeah, that's how much it costs to live in the ghetto.  Oh. Hey Stan.  Hey Stan, did you hear about the ghetto? It was so fucking poor.
Dude, look at this!  It's like a rehab center, a prison, for poor people.
This is like East Denver or something.
This is so awesome! We've got to do this! A ghetto TV show!
It's the only thing left! God, this is so dope!
Gingers are so fucking stupid.
How much do you pay?
Hello, ma'am. How's the week going?
Gingers are so fucking stupid.
How much do you pay?
Hello, ma'am.
What's the matter, Kyle?
We can't decide what to buy with fingering?
What's the matter?
Sweet. I hadn't even thought of it.
I'll bet ten bucks that's what they do when they find out your parents are killing time.
Oh, come on, it'll make you think you're a good kid. I don't think I'm enough of by.
You?
No, you're not gonna believe it. I'm actually not drunk enough to drive.
I'm just trying to drive safe, you guys. I'm not gonna be okay.
Yeah, uh huh. How are you Kyle
====================
I think this is the best kit you've ever seen. The toilet! The washcloth! The sterile water feature! The shower!
Guess again.
We are dealing with a starving crocodile, so we're gonna need more than that.
More than that. We also have to save Smurf and the Smurf babies.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, the tricky part is, how do we get all the money we need, when Smurf and the others have already died?
Don't you say that to make the rice cakes look good?
Yes, thank you.
The antidote to all our  diarrhea?
Yums.
Well, I'm glad you asked, Clyde.
Not really, but... I tried that.
Then we're gonna need the frozen doughnut, too.
All right, now let's go.
Un!  Cu-g-gah!
I'm sorry, Uncle Howard.  Ow!
Good-bye, Aunt Jemima.
Uncle Howard, I... I have a pretty crappy stomach. If we save Smurf and the other creatures from being freeze-burnt, well then we're gonna need the frozen doughnut as well.
Yes. E-e-enjoy your sweet cup of tea. Good luck.
Boy, that was the happiest I've ever been. I ate it all, knowing that neither I nor Stan were to get the antidote antidote.
Good-bye, Aunt Jemima.
Boy, I wanna get down on my knees and use my antidote now. I wanna get down on my knees and use my antidote now!
...No.
There's a fountain outside.
The Wind Heals!  There's a fountain outside.
Stan, what the hell is that?
God damn it, Uncle Howard Lineker!  You know, you guys, there's already beboons in the State of Utah over there! They wanna have bean counters and bean sales!
Yuh-you guys, there's beboons in the State of Utah too!
Where is it?
No no! ...No!
Where is it?!
OFF!
OFF, FRIENDS!
Where is it?!
They're everywhere!
Yeah well, when they're pissed off they go away.
They mostly come at night to sleep in their parents'
====================
Tweek, what do you think about Kyle's parents being caught cheating on you?
What do you think about Kyle's parents being caught cheating on you?
Anything to go on, Butters.
Okay, just who we want to talk to? Craig, who do you think is funniest?
Who?
Butters.
"Kenny, you're bein' sooo lis-an awful lot."
Nah, he's funnier than that. He's such a lis. He's such a lis-an asshole.
How do you know? We never do anything."
Jesus Christ.
Hey, shh shh shh!  Alright, come on, guys. If we can agree something's up.
Alright, let's do it.  We should split the money. Let's say $1000.00 to the really stupid people in the band.
It's so fuckin' stupid, you guys! How do you know?!
Butters, you're the best tuner in the whole world!
Goddamnit, get us an iPad!  Why does Butters have to wear a suit and tie?
Dude, the whole world knows that Butters is a stupid asshole!
Kyle, I want my number.
Okay, fine dude, we'll settle this in the morning. Turn on the radio, Kyle.  That's it. Turn on the radio.  Huh, nothing.
Yeah yeah,nothing.
Hey, it's that Butters you need to talk to.
Butters, I think I can help you get this year's numbers.
Oh, I got this stupid parking brake.
I used to be poor, Kyle. Now I'm rich.  Now it's not funny, Kyle. It's painful.
All right, let's settle this one myself. Geary.
Yes. We should start planning now. We've learned our lesson.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Here we go!
No! Screw this, we have to go tell Kyle we have a problem!
Butters!
Butters, what were they doing?
That was just you and me! Screw it! We have to go to LAUGHTERS!
We had a problem! Butters doesn't give a shit about Kyle!
Kenny? Kenny?  Sorry, but I think we've figured this all
====================
A startup company that sells hand jobs but uses the tax dollars to hire illegal aliens.
Singapore!
What?! Oh, you didn't tell us, Kyle! We could be the first American company to do it!?!
Too late for that!
Kenny's got it wrong! We had a huge lead! And Kenny is right
Come on, Butters, you gotta get through the roof!
Did you see that?, that was just a million times better. You gotta get there, dude.
We did it! We did it!!!
Do you believe me?!
Ugh... Ow.
Oh, relax, I'm not feeling down!
I agreed. You're always myee.
Aww, you guys are such better than me. Think I'm the best chef in the world?
Oh, God, relax! I couldn't be more nervous!
After yesterday's taco place was pretty good, I'm gonna have to eat another chocolate cupcake. Oh, you guys, you're gonna be down soon!
It's just a matter of time before we're gonna have people on illegal drugs. I mean, just the taste of that cupcake.
God, you know what, when you see us on TV eating that cupcake, you're gonna be sopping in jubilation!
Oh, please, I don't know what weasel words.  I just, weasel words... of course.
I know, I know, but... When I want a hot cup of tea, I just take the cupcake in my hand and suck on it like a man. And you know what? Weasel words! Oo Oo Oo'z Oo'z weeeeee.  Weec Kaur, weec Kaur, weec Kaur. Weec Kaur, weec Kaur.
Weec Kaur, weec Kaur, weec Kaur.
I took a bunch of black magic from the depths of the depths of hell.  The taste is awful.
Gee, I wonder who took the time out to get a semen sample from our mouths?
Eeehh, excuse us, guys. Forget the sex, just the smell.
Juden est verboten, jakov.
You guys, come on. We don't have much time!
One please.
Ma'am, we don't have much time
====================
God, I wish I could be poor again! I'd be a peasant in a few days!
Looks like Stan's family's fine. Looks like Stan's finally adopted the gir-  he- with big boner.
Oh, it' just so your balls stop getting full of germs.
Nice. See you around.
Alright everyone, now that we're dealing with the high schooler, let's talk about the soccer player. Kyle is my soccer player son, so I'm gonna go out and get him.
Don't worry dude, I can play ball with you.
Yeah, this is sweet.
Kyle is the hot name among XBoxes and up, bro. Let's go!
Dude, look at this!  It has Kyle's and his Kyle inside it.
If you ask me, a Nintendo Wii is like a wet rag; you throw it in the garbage, and it's come out clean.
Yeah. Kyle.
Dude, Kyle.
Dude, look at that little green ball. It's like a wet rag; you toss it in the garbage, and it's come out clean.
Yeah, and I love Kyle. I think he's totally awesome.
This is awesome. Welcome to the club, Kyle.
Uh-huh, what-what is this?
No, nothing dude.
What does this have to do with Kyle?
I can't tell you this, Kyle. I know you're trying to make me feel better, but I think maybe your jealousy is being spiced with jealousy you cast on me.
Oh, for God's sake dude!
This is so awesome. There's no more jealous in the world!
Yay, XBox wins!
We'd better get going, hurry!
What's the matter, Kyle?
Sorry dude, my Wii is really sweet.
Uh-ho, yay! Oh man, that is hysterical!
Hey, I like your Wii so much that you just makes me put it on end
Nuh-uh.
You guys, it's just me.
I don't know what- Jesus, I shouldn't have told you this first.
Kyle, eh?
Forget it! Just forget it!
I win!
Huh?
You guys, that is such a dream, you guys! I have been working so hard to become a
====================
Hi guys,

Wendy, Wendy.  Working together with you will make a big difference in how you feel.
Working together with you means so that when you're not feeling happy you can be proud of who you are.

You gave it your best.
Nothing's wrong with me. I just have to let somebody else take my DS4.
Yeah, it's cool. I have a sweet dream.
Let's go get him.
Okay, Wendy, hang on.
Sweet. Hey, should anything happen, be safe, I'll call you back.
EH!

====================
I don't know, Kyle. I don't know, 'cause I'm not a Christian.
But that's what it comes back to, Kyle.
But that's what it says in the ad: "You can't change people's minds, Kyle. They just don't fit the bill."
It's funny because, it's true. I was always Christian, but now I'm a dick.
You're gay, Kyle.
Yeah yeah, I'm mean psyched away all night to the minute that you could get raped by a goat, and now every morning I'm like, "Wow, I can't believe how the show manages to make me feel so good."
Because it manages to make me feel good, doesn't it?
Kyle, when I think about it, I hope that's a sign that maybe there's something we can learn from the mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and, maybe, hope that we can learn that we can learn from it.
All right, can you tell us something about yourself?
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation. I don't wanna sit here and be like Kenny. I don't wanna be in his class.
Yeah, but I have a way that we can make everything okay. I'm gonna get Kyle killed anyway.
Because I'm not a Christian.
You're not gonna be a Christian believably. Unless... unless you want to be Christian about it.
Okay. Next lie, lie, lie, and here's the big finish.
Good morning, Mr. President. I have just written a book about the Civil Rights Movement. It's about to go up on Amazon.
I didn't sign up to be a part of it, you guys. It's better than your brother's.
It's so great. Somebody got me need I say a million dollars.
Good samaritans. Tell me you're not with Clyde Frog anymore.
Good point.
No way Clyde Frog is the last Jew I ever heard of.
Good point.
I'm not a Christian, man.
Okay, and I'm poor as shit. I can't even get by on welfare.
I'm not a Christian, man.
There's two Jew kids living in South Park, you guys. One is a Jew, the other a Christian.
Fuck Jesus.
There's two more Jew kids
====================
I've got to get to the Sunnyland Forest.
Ah, the forest.
I've got to get to the Sunnyland Forest.
No!
No, I meant, you know, the Clyde Frog Pond.
Huh?
What the hell?
Oh, dude, this is pretty sweet!
Dude, screw this! I'm not gonna come down to the mall and have my mom take me out!
You'll owe me twenty bucks, Token!
Fuck you, Token! You're a dick!
Eh, the second one isn't gonna work, Token!
Oh, Token, life is too short!
I voted for Obama, Token! Well get out the second one!
Wait, you guys, this is just as bad as the first!
Oh, fuck you, Token!
Seriously, guys. Please, we've got to do something.
Fuck you, Token! You burned my mom! I love you!
Fuck you, Token! That's the last thing I wanna do!
Fuck you, Token! I hate you!
Yeah. I'll blow your friggin' head off.
No! No, this isn't funny! Token, you are a liar!  Hello?
Mr. Mackey, Stan? What the hell is this weird thing?
Jesus, you big tattle? You don't start titties!
Jesus, you don't start titty-twitching!
AAAAAAAH!  Oh, Jesus, here it is!
Mom, don't you love this guy?
Jesus, he's a God-damned loser!
Mom, you got a tattle box?
Jesus, don't you love that guy too much?
Mom, you got a tattle box?
Take that, Timmy.  Fist bump.
Hey, it's that asshole! That asshole kicks my ass!
Jesus, you know what this is?  That's right, we- Uh hey, I was just about to order some dinner.
Could I have some dinner italian food you guys?
No, I'm not gonna come 'round, sir.
No, I'm not gonna come 'round, sir.
No, I'm not gonna come 'round, sir.
No, I'm not gonna come 'round, sir.
No, I'm not gonna come 'round, sir.
====================
They say that love is the most important emotion in life. But... I've been through a lot together. You see, our love for Nintendo was first and foremost a result of a few simple rules.
Rule number two: No jealousy. No gay feelings. No, really, just... no, no, no, no.
No! No, nono, español! No, it's not fair! You ripped off my mom, dude!
Yeah, but... Butters, you got leprechaun questions?
...Oh, look at those rosy-cheeked eyes.
Whoa, look at that.  Huh, nothing but trust and love between partners.
That's right.
You know, we're just trying to help you guys. The mom says you have to be patient.
Yeah, it's healing. The own skin.
Yeah, it's healing. Just hold on a minute. The day's about to get a lot brighter. You guys wanna help?
What's a birthday party for?
What?
What?
Wait a minute. Where's my birthday present?
Naw, give me that back!
No!
No, it's okay! I'll give you that, Scott Tenorman!
I give you my present, Scott! It's... very simple. Just say, "You should never wear a nanny while you're sleeping."
Hey, what the fuck is a Christmas present?
Huh?!
Well, what's the use?
Scott Tenorman doesn't give presents to the poor guy.
Hey, you know what that means, Scott?
It's Christmas presents.
Huh?  Huh?  Aww!  Oooh! Christmas car keys!  Oooh!  Pooh!  M h o n d p h o d
Huh? What do I lookin' there, Scott?  Oh!  Oh, this is some kind of cool Christmas adventure! There's a treasure chest full of Christmas decorations!  M h o w r o d
Huh?  Where's the treasure?
Oh, I mean, why would Scott tell Scott he can get one?!
He's gonna take all the treasure away and he do it from you!
What?
Oh, Scott, you're not supposed to talk to anybody since we've been at it for days.
How could
====================
Nooooooooo... NOOO!  Next item!

Oh no! Aaaa!  They're back! They're coming!
They... are coming!
No, NOO!
No, NOO!
They... are coming!
Not yet, of course.
What's this?
Wait, what? What? What the hell?
Wait, wait, wait! I don't get it!  All this time I've been waiting for Christmas... a fuckin' Chuck E Cheese accident... I guess... I guess I'll finally get presents!
What?
Yeah, it's nice having you as a friend. I-  Oh Jesus, you losers! No!  AAAAA!  Bah!
Uh, this is cool. Welcome to the club.
It's Christmas special. Everyone should be stoked.  Everyone should at least be stoked.  Everyone should be stoked... They're like, blowing a kiss of innocence at the idea of a Black kid in the know being punished like that... Oh, God!
Uh, it's not cool, Kyle. It's WRONG!!  Everybody deserves a SNACK at Christmas with a Black kid in the know - you're gonna be so upset.  And everyone deserves a Christmas special with a Black kid in the know satire!  This is WRONG!!  And nobody deserves a Christmas special with a Black kid in the know satire!  This is WRONG!!
Aw, Jesus!  So funny.  And now everyone at the club will get a SNACK for it.
Memememee!
Wow, looks like everyone is enjoying ourselves.
Well, we could all just be getting our hands on that Pee Wee, Kenny.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well, Kenny, you're gonna be all yours, Stan! And we're not gonna show you Christmas specials!
Hah! Uh huh, it's kind of the spirit of the party.
Hah, hypocrite! 
====================
All right, let's go!
I am the captain of this ship. I swear by my class!
Shut up, Chief.
I'm the captain of this ship.  I do not warrant any credit for trashcan numbers.
I don't know, but these phones are seriously breaking the bank.
Come on, let's go.
Dammit! How am I supposed to get these killer numbers from these dead people?!
Fine, Chief. Let's go now.
Hang on. I'm gonna find someplace safe and sound.
Just keep your eyes open for surveillance pictures. That's what the Fonics Monkey will do.
Oh hey, what's going on?  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, is this Mitch Hurley?  What, what are you, a-? Oh, this is a little French doll, giggling, who hasn't been seen in months.
Not since you walked in tonight.
Oh God, is this our city gonna end?
Hello? We're looking for you, Pol Pot?
Oh uh, we just wondered, who are you?
What do you want from me?
Oh, uh, Pol Pot?
Hello, Pol Pot. Excuse me, I am looking to replace your battery that just ran out of wire.
Oh, I don't know, it's just that one time.
Oh, I don't know, it's just that one time.
Oh, Gary, Pol Pot might be dead, but I'll be okay.
Oh, Cyborg Bill is dead, Kyle. But I swear on my life! If you anybody calls, I'll be there.
Sir, we are talking here about a sale of body armor.
Looks like Kyle's got a strong metal bracelet on him.
Oh! It's Kyle's metal bracelet! Oh my God! Oh, you guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God!
Oh, lady!
Heh, youuu are a badass Mexican hillbilly hero.
Oh, you're a big dumbass European hillbilly hero, you guys!
This is taking up my whole desk!
When I sell my book I get access to a much needed magazine line.
This is taking up my whole desk!
You guys have to get this book down! It's out now!

====================
Yes. Now I can finally relax and enjoy my new home.  Mom? Bathroom?
Excuse me?
Now look at me Mrs. Garrison! I'm always looking at you with an eye to tomorrow!
Have you seen this ad on the New York Times?
So, a man marries his first girlfriend and is all "on the move." Sounds like you're the perfect guy for me.
Okay, fine. Who needs to learn to the parking brake?
How about this guy?
You can have this guy, buy this guy parking brake; I'll put a twenty-dollar charge in his pants.
See? He gave me a free ride home.
Oh, I'm sorry. This is all my fault!
You know, I was making excuses all along the road.
How about this?
And this?
This guy just killed his mom!
This is all your fault! You screwed up that second date!
Oh, dude, here it comes!
Oh. My. Goodddd.
I almost bought it, you guys. There's like seven hundred bucks on it.
Get out of here!
Nah, I'll do it!
Oh. Did you hear that? I just, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go talk to the mall manager. I don't wanna do it for nothing.
Oh. Hey you shop manager, you cheap bastards!
I'm sorry. Did you hear that? I just, I don't do first gradia.
I do, I love this culture.
Balls, boobs, boner...  You it's right guys! I'm sorry we had this fight on the bus, and we should've been better off going home.
Yeah, it's just that... that we always seem to get away with it.
Well what are you saying? We're not supposed to do sexual stuff on a bus together!
Kiss my ass!
Oh God!
I'm so thankful that I have a brother of my own.
Christ's sake, Kenny!
Come on, Kyle! Let's go to the mall!
You're the only two people who enjoy free food and fun together. That's why I made you eat your parents!
Free food and fun! Kyle is the only free food at the mall!
Free food and fun!
That's what I wrote on
====================
This is the work of the Merry Christmas people!  Everyone, thank you for all your patience with the Cable Guy. Heres what we have in common: we will cut out the middle man and create our own television network. 
However you see it, Simon, it would be a huge blunderbuss if at all possible. Think of it this way. If we slashed off the heart of the network, what did it do? It made all the news. The left would be completely wiped out. Butters would be outmanoeuvred. And Jimmy? Kenny? Jimmy Butters! They'd be totally pissed off. Say what you would do, Butters. You'd hand the network back. The network. 
Butters.
Butters, I have seriously overreached in my attempt to destroy the New World Order. I have underestimated the power of the Christian right. We must use every tool at our disposal. 
Initiative 1, Kenny. We have no choice but to use nuclear weapons. 
Butters.
We're not going to use nuclear weapons, Butters! We just need to convince them to give us enough power to use them! Now shut up, Butters! You're always trying to get me to throw up in front of you! Now let's go pitch perfect! 
Butters!
The market is so poor that anything that's supposed to be ethical will be crap! Now pop a chocolate milkin' and bake it in a cool 180 degrees! 
Andisthepiiine!
Find Butters and bring him to the office
Find Butters and bring him to the office Pop a chocolate milkin' and bake it in a cool 180 degrees! 
Or if you will, Butters and bring him to the office Butters! Butters!
You are in default! You can't be Prime Ministerial!
Terrible! 
Bad!
Andisthepiiine!
Good, good!
Andisthepiiine!
I'll take three aspirin's and go home.
I'll take three aspirin's and go home.
But I'm not gonna be Prime Ministerial anymore, are you freaking out over it?!
Sweet.  Oh, sweet.
They're actually looking for Mr. Hankey.
He's not that funny, he's just a normal person.
No, come on,
====================
It's a big deal.  You all know my new album? Alright?! It's a biggie. Every time I go to my Grandma's house, I'm like, "Hi, Grandma, I'm going to Grandma's house."
She doesn't know how to make cakes, so I make muffins and cookies and gravy and soufflé and... and you guys know it!
Oh my God, is it just me or do you guys see me?!
Oh, look! A little girl!  You see! There's a pastry chef here!
Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma!  Here she is, her pyeng riong!  Fierce! Her balan lu'ung!
I saw your album cover!
But I had to sneak it back with me. To my surprise, her pyeng riong was so dense and puffy that it seemed to glow black and white.
I was wrong!
I'm not a psychic! I'm a human.
I stole the album cover! I'm a psychic!
What?
No! No, come back! I know I'm ugly, but I swear I'm not sharing it with any of you assholes!  Oh wooow!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, you assholes! I need a friend!
What?
No! No, I wanna go to Grandma's house! The fucking walls are gonna fall on it!
You guys, there's already more fucking crap to do!  Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home!
Haaaa! Haaaa!
Ewwwh! Ow!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, you guys! I need to be away from you for a bit.
Ewwwh! Ow!
What did you say?!
Be careful, asshole! You're gonna fall for that of course!
Oh, dick-gasm.  Oh gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
I can't do this without you! Goodbye, Mother!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, you guys! It's so boring.
Dude, why do you know that?
Drive! Drive it sledding!
I'm sorry, I have to be away from you all these years! It's my life.
Because
====================
Hey guys! Thanks for coming to our show, huh?
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you guys said at the dinner table and the significance of that comment. You've really got to understand what made me say "Women are fags."
You know, when people talk about your work, their minds are always focused on what your message is, not just about women fags.
What?
I said "teafs."
Um, Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me?
Me and my FAG, Jared. Jared and his FAG,
Jared and his FAG, Maxime
All right, fine! Get in here!  Grab your coffee, FAG. Me and my FAG, Jared, set up.
Yes, all right lackey. Put down your cup and go!
Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me?
Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me?

Ms. Lopez, could you please close your cup and go?!
Ms. Lopez, could you please place your order for dinner with me?

Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me now?

Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me now?

Ms. Lopez, could you please put your order for dinner with me now?

Ms. Lopez, could your please get down on the floor and... kick ass?
Oh, no, no, I can't be bothered to write about this work.  This is not the first time someone who identifies as a woman fancies themselves a fag. Fags who are attracted to simple, simpleminded reasons over complex, masculine reasons. Fags who are attracted to simple, straightforward reasons over complex, complex masculine reasons. These are the people I'll be looking at in the near future. Fags who are attracted to the simple, straightforward reasons over complex, masculine reasons. These are the people my brain would need to develop. Now get up, FAG! I want you to sit down at the computer now.  Looking at the pictures on the monitor, you'll see that the little girls' hair is turning brown. That's because my pituitary gland is blocking the pituitary gland's testosterone. This is why my pituitary gland is so pissed off
====================
What?
But I'm not going to Stan's house!
Mom, come on!
No, dude, Stan's not here! He's not here!
But... Mom? Kobe Bryant's right?
Kobe's not here!  He's not here!  I don't know, I'm... Here. I just... I don't know if I can take this Incredible Scott Malkinson picture of myself.  And now, as a friend, I will try to take that picture...
Yes. But I'm not sharing it with anyone.
Oh, please. I've got better things to do than piss on a stick.
.
Hello, Clyde.
I'm talkin' aloud a little while longer, but... I'm not sharing it with anyone.
...I guess I can't understand it now.
Open.
I said I'm not sharing it with anybody.
I guess I can't understand it now.
Open.
I said Googling, David Blaine.
Three months.
No, of course.
No, of course.
I like it.
It's... It's distinctive. It's, it's distinctive.
Oh, it's David Blaine.  David Blaine, you are the king of briefcases! Don't call me fat!
Look, I have a really cool idea. If you help me, I'll give you my fuckin' money!
Buh-ley, look! There's a briefcase in here.
Uh, fold him up, David Blaine!  Uh, David Blaine, you're going to big trouble if you don't-
Why?
--wait for me! Lehrer.
Hey, waitress. What was that? What was that?
No, no, he was just waiting for my shifty other hand.
What?
Oh great! You're gonna mess with your dad's shAGgy ass, dad!
Dude, no! That bitch is going down!
Oh, so you're gonna mess with it, too.  So you're gonna mess with it, too.
I can deal with it.
No, ma'am.
I can deal with it.
Yes ma'am.
I can deal with it.
...My problem is, I have a shifty other hand.
That's nono. I
====================
Pep talks to Jimmy about homework, Kyle gives his homework for him to read. Jimmy agrees.  Then we have to play the game, huh?
What does Jimmy want?
Alright Jimmy, listen: You guys have to ask me anything you guys. Anytime you have to let go of a desire, there's always tomorrow.  Any minute of our lives. 
Eavesdropper.
Uh-ho.
Well hello?
I don't give a crap about your homework, Kyle. If tomorrow is anything to go by, I don't see any reason why we can't do what we do.
No! If tomorrow is anything to go by, we're already losing.
No! We just- no!
Oh my God, no!
No! We cannot lose.
No! We cannot lose!
No! We cannot lose!
No! We cannot lose!
Well hello?
A-ha!  Yes, I'm a negotiator. I'll talk to you later.
I don't give a crap about your homework, Kyle! If tomorrow is anything to you, then I don't see any reason why we can't work together.
Yeah, we should plan this.  Alright, I'll stay here and talk to you later. 
Eavesdropper.
Alright, alright.
Mr. Mackey, I'm gonna make sure you get all your homework done in one place.
I only know how to do it doggie style.
Do you wanna do it doggie style?
This is gonna be so easy!  No? Teacher! No, bud teacher, he's gonna miss it.
Huh?
Egh. Ugh... Let's go to the toy store, maybe Stan's too young.
UFFOooo!
Oooo, yeah! Kenny's all choked.
That's right, you forget that there's an army in Iraq setting up for two weeks.
Yeah! When the fuck do they want to start setting up?!
Dude, look at that guy! He's wearing a bulletproof v-neck for two prames.
Hey, that is bullcrap!
Goddammit, why isn't everyone on the invasion?!
Well buy it while you can! The Germans are alreadyting up those, soade room! And they're gonna move them back in a little bit after they
====================
It's sweet.
Hey, guys!  What the hell? I was just setting up some photo shoots with some pretty big guys so that maybe I'll show you some of my badass bushido.
I can't wait anymore. I just... I have to get out of these stupid clothes.
Stan, dude, you know what I want to do? I wanna do whatever I can to be seen over there.
Get toude from my bushido and slide it over there.
Nono, you fucked me!
What?
Yeah, I guess we're gonna have to do that.
Heh, okay. I'll do it.
Okaaay. I've got enough bushido to last me for life.
Hey, this is sweet.
Hey! You wanna go get a guy to stop and kick his ass? I've got it!
The Swahili word for booty call. - Yeeeessss!
Uh yah sir, answer the door.
Ye-yes sir!
Yes yes, I see!
Mmmm, the bushido.
Yes, I see a burnt-out Harley Davidson. What do you guys think? Do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea?
Thanks, Wendy, it's great that we're friends now. Between the cost of food and fuel, we had to put up with a lot of stupid stuff.
And I, am looking to cut down on the number of gay Indian calls I make. I know what I'm gonna do, and what I'm gonna do first, is to only call for male friends. I know that I'm probably the most poor of all the boys, and uh, and that's fine. I just uh... I'm gonna cut it out.
It's fine. We can always go back to our theme song competition numbers if we want.
That's fine. I'm sorry. With love,
Kenny
Doug, you really think this is all a misunderstanding?
What do you mean?
Great! Now let's see... where did you get that rope from?
Dude, that's cool. We should do some research.
Yeah, dude. Look at Cartman's desk. It says we've got a twenty-dollar ransom demanded of us all.
Well go on, fool you're not gonna get away with it!  Look there,
====================
Well, the tobacco company says it's wrong and it's gonna close the gap!  What are you doing?!
We had no choice. We have the power! Come on, let's kill it!
This is ridiculous! I don't think we want our tobacco company gone. Must buy.
I don't know, maybe I'll just blow out a couple of hundredths right now.  Oh, but we could... get a guy to run for Congress! Gaw, we might as well use Smackdown!
God, you stink! This is the only competition I've ever had!
Smells like tobacco in here.
Dude, they're going somewhere else.
Can we please get the fuck out of here?
We're not gonna let them out of here.
We don't wanna be in their club.
Ugh... We just, we don't wanna be in their club.
Hah, don't apologize, Craig, you're a dork.
Well, I don't think I'm over the top about this. I used to be cool, but I feel like we've been stripped of all our credibility as a society.
We were supposed to be the cool kids, and annoying everyone would try and make us feel better. But I don't think we've been able to hold on to that feeling.
Maybe you didn't hear about the tampons case, so I can put it away.
Don't have a tampon, Craig! Don't let them fall!
Because I don't want one!
No, but I do want a Happy Meal for our funeral! It was just... Lemme see, if you could please help us.
Let's go, Mr. Hankey. Tell him how our country was made of mostly of tampons.
Thank you, Mr. Hankey. Happy Mass.  Let's go get some cigarettes, Stan.  Let's go get some Jellies, Stan.
Stan, what the hell is that?
What the hell is that?  I can't believe people take things so seriously.
What is it, God?
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Aren't we just as likely to get a bomb dropped on us as you are?
I know, right?  I know, but listen: why do we have to go through all this trouble and rush through five titt
====================
The big problem, for me, is that Kyle is an asshole. He's a black dude who was tased by a white person and then fucking killed. I really have to think about how I want to be remembered for something I did not do.
Actually, SPECK is that simple. I protected Doweber and his people from the Black Hawk Down surveillance plane crash team. I boarded the flight home with the rest of the missing people and was part of a small surveillance team looking for the missing flight instruments. When I saw the missing flight instruments, I knew I had to change my plan. I realized then that unless we all change our plans, we're actually gonna get the missing flight instruments. So I boarded the missing flight home and waited for the missing flight instruments to arrive. Unfortunately for me, the missing flight instruments came only hours after I boarded the flight. So I waited for the missing flight instruments to arrive and then waited for the missing flight instruments to arrive. Unfortunately for me, the missing flight instruments came just four hours after I boarded the flight home and waited for the missing flight instruments to arrive. Unfortunately for me, the missing flight instruments came just four hours after I boarded the flight home and waited for the missing flight instruments to arrive.  The last words I would say to my friends: "We've got to wait and see." An amazing shot made possible by a very talented and talented crew. Very few of them were born.  The star will be the darkest speck in Orion's catalog. The faintest stars will be visible as faint light speck in Orion's catalog. The faintest stars will be visible as faint light speck in Orion's catalog. The trick is, when you see them, you can't help but think that you're probably Skyler Blighted.  His name is Eric Cartman.
I, for one, owe Stan and Kyle my most profound gratitude. Their help gave us the brilliant catalog we need to succeed. And now they give us a golden certificate of approval.
We're gonna need it, you guys. And now we'll be safe from those Bebe's minions than to invade and ruin their brilliant business plan.
Yes.  And now they'll know what they're doing all by themselves. Like never giving us their gold.
Or are we?
O lo, lost gems o riches vu. The jeweler calls me back to the shop.
Could I borrow one
====================
Well, clearly he's pissed off because he sees people's intolerance and bigotry now. He just keeps tweeting, and I'm sure that's what this whole thing is gonna be about.
I'm sure he's had enough of people asking why Muslims don't show up at my birthday party. His intolerance just seems to get the best of us.
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you are on a surveillance perimeter and imagery information is not currently valid.
We are all aware of a suspicious vehicle call coming in which a twenty-something man was seen taking pictures for his boyfriend on the Internet. As we all prepare for this exciting timeskill, we are all reminded that intolerance is a reality, and that the Internet is a great way to show that intolerance exists. As we prepare for this exciting timeskill, we are all reminded that the Internet is a great way to show that intolerance exists.
Oh, and we're not gonna make it to the hospital right now, because our brains are too big.  Weak. There's no brain.
Dude, that's freakin' Denzel Washington!
Oh wow, thanks for the funny thing, you guys. Did you see that? Hip.
That's freakin' Denzel Washington!
No no, we're fine! Suck my balls!
Ey!
Why does Wall-Mart have to be so lax about trespassers trespassing its property?!
Damn, kid! You scared the crap out of me!
Yeah, if some assholes tried to fuck in my mom's car, I'd be like, "hey, how about doing the same with your parents' houses?"
Ugh.  Hey! Uh excuse me, Mr. Garrison. Uh excuse me, Kyle!
Excuse me, Kyle! Uh excuse me, Kyle, did you see this coming?!
Heh, Kyle. Uh excuse me, Kyle.
Kyle?
Uh excuse me, Kyle.
What?! How did he know we were having a fight?!
Kyle?!
AHHHHHH!
That kid is Plissken!
Ye-ah, no! Stop, Kyle! Stop, Kyle!
Stop, Kyle!
No, stop, Kyle! Stop, Kyle!  Plissken!
Kyle? Kyle?  Did you hear that?  It was like... a... clang in the chain reaction.  I just... I thought, oh pl
====================
It's hard to tell, Kyle. But lately I've been getting a little sick of covering my face and just... mooommed. Sooo, I'm  totally cranky lately, dude.
Yeah, it's all that matters. What matters most is... getting people out of their skin.  That being said, if there's a problem, I'm gonna get the kindergartners together and do something about it.  What I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna take a picture of my face... and... put it up on the Internet. I'm gonna upload it to the Internet... Let's see... Oh. Uh, okay. I guess we're gonna have to throw that out.
Huh...
Oh. Uhokay.
Uhokay.
Oh. Uhura uhura...aa.
What's the matter?
Oh, Kyle, your mom is cranky. She's the one that seriouslyworded anon aboutanthro. She's gonna kick you in the nuts if you don't address her right now.
I'm uh, working on it. I'm just gonna collect all the words thatdefine invective.NN. Feel free to e-mail me with your diatribe, uh uh-
Dear Ms. Broflovski,
I am writing to ask for your help in setting forth with a video of herself doing crossword puzzles.  Do you think she is a girl, or do you think she is a silly creature?
She looks terrified.
I am volunteering. The tampon line is dead.
Hey! I'm volunteering, Kyle! I'm volunteering at 1:45 today!
Please share this video on your social media accounts so I can help you get the word out.  We need to network a little, so that we can all volunteer at our convenience. 3:45.
It's fun games! Pick the word one at a time, tweet about it to your friends, and then tweet back.
Okay, so now we're going to use Pinterest.  What's the trending picture?
Wow, that cute!
That's not what we were just commenting on. The cat. The mouse.  What the hell?
Please stop cheating, Mom! I'm volunteering!
What?
Yay! Well then, Mom, you can finally admit it was me who did the eating disorder.
Uh what?
====================
I don't think so, Craig.
I'mo kick ass.
Aw, "poo party poo party." Those were the right size.
Aw, Butters, "get down." Those were the right sizes.
Get down!
yeh, sorry, I gotta go-
What the-?
Shh. Oh, my God. Token's mom is being a total bitch.
Taylor Swifting!
Wha, what the fuck?  Oh my God, aren't you sleepy, Token?  Oh, awww, poor person!  Oh my God, gee whiz, what on earth are they doing?!
"Noo."
Uh-oh.
Huh? Oh, I think I see Marty's turkey here.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Yeheah. Well, Token, thanks a lot for coming, but, most of all, thank you.
Yeh-heey. Token, you are very important to me. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You have to show me you're not just a fag.
Look, Token. You're with me. This is all over social media. I need YOU. ANSWER!
Noo. I'm right now- Ah I can't believe what I'm seeing. Through these... narrow eyes, I see the truth.
The world needs more fags and change. The female lead in the new Disney animated soap, Choppin' on, we're retoolin' the network for good. And we gotta do it with a more mature take on the superheroics...
Token, calm down. I don't think you're offering anything new. You think only male lead leads would do that.
Not at all. "Tough to hear, Kyle, but… Choppin' is a tough job. But I'll give you one look each day." Very few people reach their goals. That's fine. Just fine for me.
You? Token, are you feeling okay?
Yeah, just fine. Good.
Hey guys, I need to take a shit!
I'm not a dick!  Not now, Token! Just don't try and make me feel comfortable! It's not okay!
Hey Token, where are you?
Lame.
Just need to get to sleep, alright?
Aw, Kyle!

====================
I'm a little disturbed that a man has the audacity to ask for money!
Well, it sure looks like fun, Kenny.
That's not why I wrote it. I know Stallone. Don't you see?
That son of a bitch. See? That's what he does?  He fucks up his mom.
Kenny handed over $10, and I saw it in the parking lot of Gorton's.ga.rossions pizza place.
You what??
You thought something was funny?!
God this sucks, Kenny!
God I hate Kenny!
What did you say?!
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars! Look at what he does!
Dude, that's not cool! That's not cool, dude! That's not cool!
You guys! Hey, you guys! Check it out!
Because I'ma be a Jew, too.
Ellen, will you relax, you guys?
It's just a matter of time, Ellen. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.
All right, fine Ellen, just- okay with me going on about how much I hate Kyle. I mean, maybe I just kinda- maybe I just really like Kyle. I really do.
But I wanna be in the Special Olympics.
Goddamn it, you guys are not the best actors.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Oh, for Christ's sake!
But I love Kyle. I love him.
Because he's cool. Because he's cool, really.
Because he has a dream, Kyle. Dream number two.
Kyle is dead. He's e-e-e-giving up.
On his head's down.
Killer.
On his head's down.
On his head's down.
No, Kyle's here. Give it up. I need more time.
God-damnit! I'm gonna give up! What's the matter?
Everything alright so what's the matter?
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
God, I don't know what to do. I'm like, 40 years into this life of crime. I don't wanna live it anymore.
Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna kill you.
You know, we used to be good friends.
How?
I just want to know what you think
====================
It's called "Operation: Cannot Find My Parents." If you haven't already been there, please, be a part of it. I'm not gonna find my parents' bodies until after they leave school.
Okay, Timmy. Now, the first thing we have to do is get rid of the bodies. We're gonna have to find the space to put them up. And maybe, if we leave them there, they're gonna start dating new men.
Butters, you have to be firm about it. Somebody's got to be there, by now.
All right. Now, the first step is going to be getting all the girls' space. You know, 'cause it's the easiest thing in the world, right? Just take the space, Kyle!
And I'm afraid that space is now mine!  No! No, it's mine, my mom says so!
Not again!
Butters, will you relax, Kyle? Just make sure everyone is accountedoint and safe in your bedroom!
Well, sure. Will you take a look in my bedroom?  Oh, no! A chick is about to have a total meltdown!
Well what?
Oh sweet, you guys, you guys! You guys are my best friends ever, okay?!  Oh gee whiz? Me and my best friends forever!
We are gonna have a Jizz Bean fight! All we need to do is tell everyone that we found the bodies of all the girls from last week's sports team game! We have to tell everyone now! That's it!
Ugh... Oh gee whiz...  Oh gee whiz...
Nothing. No sign of forced entry.
All that we know it comes to us at school, at recess. That's what says "We know it comes from science."
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get our hands on it.
Hey hey, what's goin' on?
Oh God, I don't even know how to tell you this.  The tooth fairy!
I have a theory kid.
Yeah, but I'm not a part of it, you guys. We have to find the tooth fairy!
No, but they are trying to find the tooth fairy, so they can lure us back for another game of Chicken.
This may be safe as a cucumber, you guys. If we take it out
====================
Nyah! You guys, nyah!
You guys, nyah!
Shut up, I'm serious!
Shut up, I'm serious!
Nyah! You guys, nyah!
Shut up, I'm serious!
Nyah! You guys, nyah!
Shut up, I'm serious!
Nyah! Yeess, Goddamnit, I'm serious!
I'm serious!
Okay, I have control of my temper.
Goddamnit, shut up!
Okay, Goddamnit, I'm serious!
No, I don't. I don't. I just, I just don't care.
Oh, pretty good. Titties!
No, flash, hold on.
Shut up, titties!  What the hell is that? God damnit, I didn't see titties!
Titties! That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Good one, God damnit. Good titties.
Bluh bluh bluh bluh!
E'mon dude! Give me back my pajama!
Bobo! Eh, you got it? Eh, you got it.
Eh, you got Bobo!
Give me back my pajama, Bobo! Eh, you got titties!
Give it back, Bobo!
Goddamnit, I was just trying to get some stuff out of you, you fundamentalist!
No, no, Bobo, that's Kenny's mom!
Oh, noe-deeded!
I don't wanna anyoo!
Haa-aa-aha! Haa-aa-aha!
Give me back my pajama, Bobo! Yee-ee-ee!  You're not a democratic South Parkitis, Kenny! You  are!
Give and take your Ritalin, and KFC, Wendy's Chili, at least give me back my itch!
Thank you, thank you.
I know I have it all.
I know I have it all, Mom.
Mom, she's making me miss the Panda Bear dance.
Fat child, she's fat.
My mom says if I eat enough chili, I'll get certified to crawl.
Cat pee? What the hell is that? Mom?
Cat urine? Mom?
Oh, that's

What?!
I'm not gonna make you do anything.
Hey, you're not hot enough.
You're not hot enough.
Hey! Hey!

Hey! I knew you were tryin' to fuck me, weren't I?!
Yeah, I know dude. I-I know what you're doin' with my picture. I just, I know that picture belongs to me.
I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of clown showin' up and doing what weasel words say.  We need to get together, we've got ten minutes before lunch, time to meet today with the new members. The meeting is today.
Kyle, I just wanted to remind you that I'm goissin' to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich here, but that member is already here.

Oh awesome, huh? Good.
Whoa, thanks, everybody! I wanna eat a sandwich!
Uh oh, it's yours, Kyle.
Nuh uh.
I'm sorry.
What?
Goddammit!  What does it feel like? I don't know. I'm totally tired.
Four days without rest. I don't know if I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm totally tired.
Yeah, I'm not givein' up! I'm givein' up!
Yeah, I'm grub, 'cause I'm like, you know, half my body is fattalkin' talk!
Oh it's so cool you guys! I've been workin' on making up for a while, and then I found a friend who's really helpin' people! I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure that happens!
Hoho, I'm not givein' up, Kyle! I know I'm different! I'm different than you!
Newbie shoppers? Come on!
We're putting a freeze on this poster! If you see a kid
====================
A Look At The History Of Drugs In The World...
I'm not saying it.
Yeah I don't need to hear that. I know how it feels to be really messed up. It's all I've been thinking. When I think about what took place in my childhood, and what we can do about it, I get really irritable. It's like when you walk through that door, and see what's in it, you start freaking out. "Aarrrrgh! I'm aarrrrgh! I'm aarrrrrrging!" But when you see what's inside, you start freaking out. I can't control what I say. I'm thinking, "This is a bad flu shot, and I don't wanna get it!" But all of a sudden, I can't control it.  When I think about it, it makes me wanna roll over.  Yeahhh. B-yeah, bad flu shot, now what would I give to give? What'd I give to give?  What? What'd I give to give?  What?
Mom, it's the bad flu shot!
So what happens when the shot wears off?
bad flu shot, now what would I give to give? What'd I give to give?
what? what'd to give? What'd to give?  What'd to give?  What'd to give?
bad _________
Bad flu shot and now th-what's left is a life saver. I can go out and... shoot rats... or, I can wait until the morning and... get dressed.
Life saver. I get to shoot a rat in the face or else I'll be dead.
vouses, là-ait pas très.
I got a life saver, you guys.
Y la tittablée. Ségol me ségol.
I got a life saver, you guys.
awful! I shot a rat in the face!
And a-but, but then I got to work, I tried this: I put a twenty-dollar note in the bedroom door. And I put a dollar in the door too! So that if I mess up the rat test, I'll have to take half a million to go to the bank!
Life saver! If I mess up the test, I get to take half a million to
====================
I don't know, Kyle. I don't know."
I don't know, Kyle. "Kyle, we should have a big party tonight."
Heh, I know. "Huh? What party?"
No way! How can we party?!  What the hell does that mean?! Leprechaunauncuriosity. Hate speech? All these stupid rules?! Can you imagine?  A bigscreen g-word?  Oh my God! Oh my God!
Ye-ah! Totally immature!
No.
No. That's not at all what I said.
No! No!
Goddammit!  Kyle, that's just gross stupid! I totally said, "Kyle, I want you to think about something. And if it makes you feel better, you might want to think about something else." I totally said, "Kyle, I want you to think about how bad this is, okay?! Think about how much you hate me and how much you hate yourself!" I totally said, "Kyle, no! Think about how good this is, Kyle!" And yet, I still said, "Kyle, I want you to think about how much you hate me and how much you hate yourself." So then I turned to Kyle and said, "You know, how much you hate me and how much you hate yourself?" And so Kyle smiled and said, "I'd like to undo some of the hate, and see if it makes you feel better."  I'm happy that's finally come out.  Thought I saw a way to make you feel better, Kyle.  Ooohhh. Huh.  Mm, mooohhh.
I'm feelin' it now!
Its grip is pulling at my fat scrotum!
We'll never know your secret, Kyle.  Oh, God-damnit!  Its pulling at my fat scrotum! Feeling it just now.
I thought you said boobs were a bad person, Kyle. Thats what I said.
Shh. Help. Me over here.
Ready?
Okay. Uhokay. Ready, Jennifer.
No! No, I wanna jump off of a house!
Okay. Uhokay. Ready, Jennifer.
Hey! She's trying to hurt you! Hey, I'm hitting a sweet spot right now!
I'm getting pissed off! You know that girl you're
====================
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally do it on Blu-ray!  Now everyone! Everyone! The Blu-ray copy of Aliens for the Sony PSP! And the audio version for the Nintendo DS!
All right, everyone! The final product looks great, but do you know what else? It's stupid.
Ugh...  All right, all right, fine. I'm all set! I'm ready for the big time! Anybody Butreeh?!
Butters?!  Stan, you've got to tell Kyle. Don't worry, I have a plan.
I just made money off of people's handicaps! They don't have to use me, they just need to exploit it.
I'm not lying Roy.  I'm big into cheaters, aren't I? You guys know what I'm talking about? Just play the part of the cheated, fake cheater, Kyle.
Oh, Stan, I thought you were the one who pretended to have AIDS, but then started a drug store and died of AIDS.
I can't let you do nothing to me! I'm not HIV-positive!
Oh, Kyle! So maybe you should tell Kyle that I'm not HIV-positive! Look, maybe your friend died from AIDS, but was it a bad thing that you did or didn't?
Clyde...  Yeah, Clyde... He was a big St. Patrick's Day supporter.
And now he's suing me and my friend, saying that he has AIDS and that I have HIV, and that I have sex with him.
It's tragic, isn't it, Kyle? What have you done?
You just sued me and my friend, and just like that you got the girls pregnant. You just had sex with his girlfriend, and then he got sick and died. What has happened to your life so far?
I get to go on the run and be the first one of my kind and still have HIV, so I'm just not interested in being the first one of my kind. I wanna be the first one of my kind, you guys.
Hey Kyle. What's up?
Really? Really nice swimsuit? Next?
Next First Contact item for sale.
Just like a lot of people's reviled boats, but still pretty, pretty legs, pretty legs, nice dress, and nice hair.
No
====================
Hey guys!  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of The Fat Guy Sandwich Co.  So, what are you gonna do tonight, Kyle?
Go fuck yourself? Fuck yourself to death! Hahahahahahaha.
I don't know, I'm actually gonna go fuck myself. Hahahahaha.
What?
Nuh uhn nun, the naked woman just got fingered with a whole bunch of times!
Oh, it's not fair! What did you say?!
Butters, suck the balls Fuck you!
Butters, I don't think we're doing a damn thing!
Oh look, a bunch of fat bitch's fingered with a bread knife!
Oh look, a bunch of fat bitch's fingered with a bread knife!
Oh, look what Mel Gibson did. He made me do something.

I'm done making video games! I'm done making video games!
I'm done making video games! I'm done making video games!
Oh, you're done, you're done!

Game over, Craig. Now we're gonna do it ourselves.
No, that's an asshole for mocking my mental state.
Oh yes, let's do it, Kyle.
Let's do it, Kyle! Let's do it, Mel!
Mmm. And is it great you asked? Psst. More...

Kenny!
...No, it's okay, you know. Kenny and I are gonna get it on the Internet. I need your help.  Okay, okay, look, Kenny, look. Uh, this is it. This is it. This is the Internet. I want it Ralph and Kyle would like to visit each other.  Well it'll be good if you're cool, too, Kyle, since you're a real jerk.
Okay, Wendy, this is it. This is how we all go about getting the Internet famous...  Shutting it off.
All right. I want the Internet to be as relevant as possible, so that people can come to see us.  Shutting it off won't mean much, because... we want everyone to think we're just some geeky, nerdy, studious, metalhead chick.
And that is exactly what we are! Do you have a room available?
Yes, you're about to get that homework done! Yes, we're about to a hall!
You see that? That's the hall we are going to get our video game controller.
That's right. And that's exactly what we want! That's right, Kyle! Cool!
We... have video games, stupid! But we want you to remember that! If you don't make it to the front of the singing contest choir, we'll have it made!
Making games for fun and profit is not cool! We are-
Oh God.
Naw, come on! We've gotta get out of here! Now! Come on!
Uh oo what?
Dude, that little bitch beat us over the medal stand! Get out of here!
Motherfucker!
You can't kick my ass again!
Dude, chick.
Oh God.
Hey, I didn't think you were getting into video games, Kenny.
I know, I know: you're into video games, dude.
Yeah! This is my new best game.  Hey! You guys are bad!
Dude, I think I'm hooked.
I'm ready, my- my mom is rah-ah.
I'm not playing games anymore, I'm just focused on my basketball game. I can't play games anymore than you guys are.
Dude, you're my best friend, I'm so hooked on this game that I forget
====================
This is a rush of red lights! Get out of my way!
Mom, drive fast! I'm gonna pull away if you're trying to scare me!
I'm trying to take a shit!
Mom, please don't kill me for speeding! It's not fair!
Suck my balls!
Drive hard! I don't wanna be in his class!
Hey!
Kenny! Screw you guys! I'm going home!  Move it!
It's okay, dude. I don't blame me. I know I messed up the red light.
Why do we care about the red light?
If it was any other light, it would be going straight down.  It's still down.
Hey, it's the light that's supposed to be up and relevant now.
I know, it's confusing but I think we need to change it.
Yeah, it's awesome.
It's helping us a lot.
Yeah, it's funny, Kenny thinks we're stupid.
Yeah, it's funny, Kenny thinks we're stupid.
Kyle thinks we're super-smart.
He's gonna be a genius by the time we get to the finals.
Stan will totally think we're super-smart, though he won't know until the finals.
Stan forgot, though, that we're actually supposed to be playing the new program now. And that means the finals!
Who do you think is the weakest link in the school?
Who's the weakest link in the school?
Hey, maybe we can convince Kyle to come with us.
This is all our fault, Kyle! We gave away all our money!
Oh, really? Let's see... The Poolside.  He has a thing for losers, understands that!
Let's see... The art teacher forgot to bring us a pen name, reminds us that forgetting is a violation of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights!  They're going to have to throw in the towel, and then they can throw in the towel a little more!
Who is going to the finals?
Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
Ehhhh.
Minutes!
What's the deadline?
Two days from now it's going to be instructional time.  Hey, guys, check it out. We're only two blocks from the finals. You wanna see what's in store for us?
====================
Well, I'm glad you guys enjoy your podcasts. I know I'm just a crappy human being, but... the world needs me more than I'm worth. I don't know if I can ever get enough of you. Please, I'm going to kill you guys right here.
...You guys? What the hell are you guys doing?!
What?
Eh- shut up, Kyle!
Shut. Shut. Shut.  Alright, Kyle, see that you got the sleigh riding in the back of the back-
Ah, ah I guess you're right, Kyle.  There we go.  Lucky for us, it's Cartman.
Nice work, Kyle.
And so it is with a sad but true truth: I have cheated on you for good reason.
You guys, look what we got.
After everything we've been through, we get this: We were children taken from our parents.
We were forced to walk through the streets, with norollers around us. Everything was made of cardboard.
Yes, that was us.
There's two more bags of candy and a pack of chewing-os on the ground floor.
Everything's ready!
Don't make us do it, Mom! We'll kick you in the nuts!
We want to know what exactly happened to us!
Euugh.
Mom, can you tell us what happened to us?!
How can everything still work in the future?
You tell me!
Tell me again how everything was turned upside down!
You say, "How come the spider doesn't jump?!"
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned.
Stupid hats!
How come Christmas is now Hanukkah time?
How come Christmas is now New Year's Eve?
How come New Year's Eve is now Christmas Eve?
From now on, I'm a free spirit, a to-die-for bit of Christmas candy.
How come Hanukkah is now New Year's Eve as well?

I do have a problem!  Some fat ugly Mexican, just got on a pair of Prancerones, and killed everyone in it!  I did it, Mom! If I'm gonna survive this, I'm gonna have to get up and walk right up to a camera and start pinch-hitting it!  Mexicans do that!
Don't worry, Butters, it's not gonna be fun. I know I'm not gonna be able to control my tremorscery.  I'm gonna have to think more clearly about what I'm doing.
How do I reach this part?
Well, the first thing I have to do is get his attention.  When Kenny sees what I'm doin', he immediately starts running away.
Oh yeah, he's excited.  He should, if I'm honest to my knowledge, be more than excited. He'll be runt 'im not stopin' his runt right over here.
I'm notprey. I gave him one dollar.
He won't give it to meee! Give it to meee!
Hurry up, Kenny!  What are you doing? He'll startiving us.

====================
So, Kyle, I had to ask you one thing: Would you tell the whole school the truth about Cartman?
I'm more than happy to tell the whole truth, but only if the students around me tell the whole truth.
You can't blackmail me, Kyle. But still want proof?
Just squeeze... a picturrrlllllllll.
Hello, is this City Wok?
It will take some convincing, but whatever is enough for today.
It's just after recess, all right? I want to talk to you about my homework, okay?
What's the matter, Mayor?
You know what I'm talkin' about, Mayor? Token's a chicken. Token, I should never have believed in you.
Fine, Token. I guess it was great news, seeing as how your birthday is now tomorrow?
What? What?!  Oh, that's bullcrap! Zip!
You wanna tell me the truth, Butters?
He's lying! He's lying about what he said.  And now out on bail, you can rest easy knowing that nobody can resist on his behalf.  So let me get something right before the hearing.  My report today is on abortion too.  I didn't think you guys were telling me there was anything amiss with this one exception. I saw the abortion button at the front of your shirt.
What?
Oh my God! Butters didn't tell us what he thought about abortion, okay?! He was just out of touch!
What?!
Oh, you're lying to everyone. Oh, you're just trying to make me feel better, Kyle!
You're just trying to make me feel better, Kyle. What do you think, Kyle?
"Was it a good idea?"
"Was it ethical?"
All right, those are the questions I'm asking.
If you want to change the world, you have to change the abortion laws. You know what I'm talkin' about, Mayor.  What I'm talking about, is what I call "Abortion Who Have No Idea."  When I say "already had an abortion," I'm talking of course about as soon as the shell comes out you will no longer be able to have an abortion. Now, when I say "ready," I'm not saying you have to take her to the emergency room, I'm just saying
====================
Hey guys!
Well, this sucks because you guys are the worst, so you gotta take action!
Tell Mayor Bill de Blasio that the Nintendo 3DS is bad!
Don't talk about the 3ds in public, you assholes!
Talk to Mayor de Blasio and tell him the 3ds are bad!
Go to Applevillefishing.
Get Ralph in here to buy him amilo.
Don't forget, Ralph's mom is the fat kid from the pig-turd war.
Talk to the Mayor and convince her to hold a rally to tell the world what the 3ds are really about.
Go to Sea World, Mom. Tastes like fish tank and whale tank. Food and water divers.
Brrr poop-bitch!
You know what you do when you want to stay in the past but have to do it on a computer? ThinkPlanet...

Hey!  Time Turner, how many CSI shows have you seen?
How many Powerpoint sessions has it taken you to master?
You can't manipulate the data!-uh!
Hold on, I'm getting old!  What did you say about forcibly removing one's bra?
I don't know, I just know damn well what you're talking about about.

You Tube guy!
Aw, shut up, Craig!  What serial killer are you?!
"Let's see: 1. I saw Bebe getting her breasts removed from Wanda in the hospital; 2. I saw Bebe get her breasts removed from Jimmy's house; and 3. I saw Bebe get her breasts removed from Jimmy's house."
Bebe!
Beth!  Shut up, Bebe! I'm not gonna let you sell out your friend!
And so it came about that I saw Bebe get her boobs removed from her mom's chest.  I watched as she got her boobs
====================
Well, you've gotta be kidding me, Kyle! There's no Stan and Jimmy and gross little Jimmy looking like they have ass on their left cheek! There's no Jimmy and no Stan and Jimmy!
Alright, get out of here, you goddamned rats!
Oh, yeah! Jimmy and Alec just had their moment in this game, isn't there, Jimmy?
Yeah! Here they come, there's no more Alecs!
Okay, go go, here they come. I'm going home.
Aw, screw them. This game's boring, Kyle.
They're going off the gridode, idiot!
What do you mean, clown?
What do you mean, dude?
Okay, we're gonna build a bomb shelter, Kyle.
Kyle, guess what we're gonna do, right?
Well, suppose you have a man -
Kyle!
A bomb shelter!
Yeah! Let's make it like this!
A clubhouse!
Okay, let's try this: if we make it like this, we can get all the money we want!
Ah!  I'm gonna do it, Kyle!
A boat!
No! Why take my boat, Craig?!
Go go go!  It's better than your brother!
No! That's a bad joke! Let's go to the Bahamas!
Yes, please!
...And now this nightmare 
Nothing, Kyle.
It's not...

No, it's okay. I'm serious!
Hello?
Space man? Awesome. What the hell is that?
...Okay, okayokay. Gotta be convincing, Space Man.
 ...Okay, Space Men...
...Okay, you're good, Kyle.
Hoh, I wonder what Stan got into when he died? He just couldn't contain the grief of having to watch his friends die.
...What?  No! No, he was awesome!
Okay, fine, go ahead.
Nothing Stan. You're gonna be in a long line for our bus ticket office. Nobody's gonna show up.
Wheh? Where's the line?
Oh, it's over, it's over! Nobody can see us! We still have our bus ticket office!
Oh no! We've just added another retard to our already great crowd!
Thanks, Stan, you're very welcome.

Alright, we'll cut to the chase.
Well, I didn't wanna be a dick to you guys, Kyle, and I hope you guys don't mind me bringing Scrotie back to life, right? You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?

But I'm sure I'm not judgein' you, Kyle.
That's fine.
Well you can go on and do whatever you want, I'm sure that nobody will ever know I made fun of Cartman's penis.
Oh yes, High Noon. This is a common occurrence, Kyle.
People are starting to notice.
People are starting to notice times are getting cold.
Hey Kyle.
You what?!
Yeah, I'd like some bread.
Oh yeah, you're right! Get it out of here!
Eh, it's okay, Kyle. It's coming out of your hole.
Kyle, will you relax, Kyle? It's springin' up here. Let's see...
There!
Where is it?
Oh, that's hard to tell, Kyle. I was just trying to get some
====================
Hello everyone. I'm here to answer your questions. The first question is, "Why doesn't it go in the book?"
I think the first reason the book is out is just because people aren't buying it. It's so obvious. Why would you want people to trust people when they buy something?
You're telling me there's a disease called AIDS, which means poor people have AIDS because of unnatural things in the earth.
People with AIDS have AIDS because of unnatural things in the earth.  God is poor, and he must have felt bad for his people because of it.
Because they have AIDS because of unnatural things in the earth. God must have felt poor for his people because of the unnatural things in the earth.  People with AIDS don't know that. They don't know that from all this.
I know you don't like my book, because it's so obvious. I'm not gonna give you AIDS until you tell me the truth.
You don't know the truth until you give it back.
You know what I'm talkin' about, you guys? Yours truly, really nice.
Ohhh.  Why do you disturb?
Why?
I am here, I demand that the book be handed over to the United States Marshals Service.  Sir, you will not only hand over the book, but that you will cooperate in any further steps you take.
Sir, I was hoping I could talk to you about the book.
Yeah?
What book is it?
I'm afraid it is The Black Jackal. Hahahaha.
Hohoho! I'm gonna get down on my knees and get ready to rape this person!
Yes, this is a real shame, that such a daring idea would come up, because honestly, eh, I wouldn't mind it. Is this really that exciting?
HA!  Thanks HairyBunny!
Thank you, HairyBunny!  Aren't you stoked?! This is great for us!
Big surprise!
Big surprise, big deal, hubby!  Whoa, whoa! We've got fraud involved! Alright, everyone quiet, so listen up!  We've got fraud involved. I've got to know all my clients before I hand over the book to the SEC.
They're too smart to see that the SEC isn't gonna give it back to HairyBunny!
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
Has anyone ever told you that?  It's not fair.  It's not cool. People don't wanna die on a Wednesday. That's not cool.
Kewl!
You can't call me fat, you goddamned Jew!
Kewl, how are you supposed to get away with calling me fat?
Man, that's the world likehin' to me. Roads are boring.
I'm not fat, that's for sure.
But I'm getting by with only my titties and half-geniot sons to be found in the Web site.
Oh. Hey, Kenny.
It's okay, it's just... I can't believe all these years I was told not to tell anybody about my eating disorder. I was told not to tell anybody, "Big titties and half-geniot." I know I'm tough, but I'm just trying to make the best out of all this.
...What?
All right, now let go of me.
Big titties and half-geniot.
 aaan'h, let go titties and half-geniot!
Aaan'h, let go, titties and half-geniot!
Is it her?
God damn it, you didn't tell me there weren't any titties and half-geniot left over!
Let's see. I want those, those pinky-eyeball.
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm getting old.
Hey! Hey, those cigarettes are old.  What the hell was that? ...Oh, hey, Kenny! How's it going?
You're not gonna tell me you never took a titty before, Kenny! Old habits die hard!
No, no, it was a tough two years for me. I was... scared... of what I thought was a normal life. And though I may appear young, I'm still the same kid from my childhood. I'm completely aware that, but... the world is not fair and square. Life isn't going to be perfect, and I definitely see that in the world of hamburgers.  I've got to do something, though.
Let's see. I need some extra lean-in.
Oh, me on Jimmy Fallon.
I'm all out of
====================
I have a question...
Why doesn't everyone just... LISTEN to us?!  Why don't we just LISTEN to ourselves?! We're too immature! We're too immature!
Fine! We know that we are pwned! We're immature, dude!! We're immature, dude!!
That's fine! We just have to focus!
...So win, boys! We'll go out and try to capture Asclepius once and for all.
Oh, I'm sure we'll find a partner.
Go kick his ass, Kenny!
Yeah, point blank.
He just can't understand why we go around shooting people in the dick like that.
That's why we have to get involved.
The dick.
Kenny!
The dick-whore.
Butters, what the fuck?  Dude, what the fuck?
I knew it! We should have been more involved!
You guys, what the fuck?  Goddamn Jews!
I knew it! We should have been more involved!
No! Don't!  God damn it, you guys!  Why don't we just shoot each other in the dick?!
Cartman, mind if I join you?
Yeah, mind if I's goin' with you.
Just shoot it in the dick, Kyle.  God damn it, you guys!
No, mind if I'm goin' with you.
It's a goo, Kyle.
Eh, so, so today Kyle is gonna go get fucked by Artemus Clyde Frog.
Yeah, bro, it's Monday, bro.
Dude, that was awesome.
Boooooo! Boo boo o bang bang!
Dude, Artemus Clyde Frog is gonna get fucked.
Boooooo, boooooo!
Dude, Stan, boooooo!
Stan, you're not gonna believe this, Kyle.  They're gonna get pictures of me with these dirty pictures of Stan's dad.
You're not gonna believe it, Kyle.
Boooooo! Boo boo o' bang bang!
Dude, Artemus Clyde Frog is gonna have his moment, right?
He's gonna have his moment, right? And he's gonna have his moment, right.
You guys, you guys! Dude, that was awesome.
Boooooo! Boo

Because men are stupid!
I know, right?  When I zoomed in I saw a homeless man walk by. Guy, you might have seen him, but he's not real. He's just a random guy wandering around town.
Yeah dude, see that guy?  Uh he's not real, he's just a random guy wandering around town.
Oh yeah, I sure do myself a favor and make myself appear as a woman.
Ugh! I am a woman, stupid!
Hey, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, trippy!
Uh, make me faint!

Hey, I'm a man I'll be looking to the east for gold, trippy!
Well, hello, I'm with the gold party. Greetings, I'm with the gold party, bidding you well of well-behaved lunch. Oh, and I'm just passing through, looking for news on the Olympic Opening. See you in a while.
Good morning, Mr. President. I'm listing all the gold medals and most covetized gold in the world. All declared, except for one: mine.
I'm not a gold fish; I'm a Tina Turner trashcan.
Dude, mine's me. Mine's me.
I'm a platinum hippie hippie hippie!
Huh?
Ohh, the hippies are gonna start coming.
I am a space man, space.

The engine is all right, it's just a matter of time.
Is the counselor getting pissed off over it?
What? What does that mean?
What? What?!

Hey, you guys. Can we order a pizza?
I was just wondering who you might be interested in.
You know the guy you're gonna be asking this morning?
pot pie, bloody hands, or perhaps your best friend?
Let's see... Mr. Mackey, could you please tell us a little bit about ourselves?
What? Why?
We're not fat. We just may be thin.
There's a lot of black people in Afghanistan today.
God, I hate them.
One of them is my favorite, my favorite band is probably

I would never take a man's word for it. She's a real slut!
You're real, you guys.
Yeah, but I'm not a real slut, okay? I'm just a sock puppet.
Nobody's gonna know. I'm online all the time. I'm on fire.

Dude, girls are such nuts.

What the hell is going on? What is this? What the hell?!
Oh, homies? I can't find the priest keys.
Yeah, I'm calling bank-one thousand times over the years. Praise the Lord. I'm calling you Catholics now!
Screw you!
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
Hey, maybe he's not in my triangle, but I'll update you guys.
It's the same triangle everyone is talking about!
Who the hell cast a vote for?!  Dude, it's Kenny. He's the nay-enthing who cast a negative vote for Warriors of the North.
Dude, weak!
Wait a minute! I've got more friends than Ky-yle have credit! So, maybe I'm just weak, and maybe I have some Catholics in my triangle.
Okay, cut the crap.I'm gonna go downstairs and make friends with older, poorer minorities.
Uh, who's your friend?
You're gonna kick my ass again?
Okay, cool, maybe I'm just a little weak-kneed.
Old people!
Oh my God, these minorities are kicking ass!
You know, we're minorities, Token! We're the Whites, we're the Hispanics!
Wait, hold on, I'm pregnant.
Dude, what's wrong with me? I thought we were the goodfella.
But moms, I've come to accept that. I've been waiting for a female-owned business for 40 years. I've worked long hours to become a woman, and I still have time
====================
Tweek!  What the hell?! Who the hell would commit this?!
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
"Dude, he just shot a Jew in the face."  Oh my God, wake up!  We've lost a man! Ow! Oh come on!
Look out, you got a call from the ghetto?
Sgt. Barbrady here's gonna like that one a piece. He's gonna go release a black guy who's shooting white guys in the dick. Hah!
That does it! I am sick of with guns shootin' and gingers bein' kicked by little half-Jews everywhere!  Let me hear about it!
I'm not getting out of this car.
I can get out of this car, and I'm fuckin' rich!
Because I'm black.
Because I'm black.
I can't see!
I can't go on living like this!
This is the ghetto. They put kids in graveyards until their voices are heard.
Don't you have a car?
Gin it up on South Park.
It's a Cop, Jared, who's in jail for shooting a Jew in the dick.
Black people are just gonna die without it being heard on the news.
It's not news to you, Kyle.
It's news to me.
Nothin' to do, Kyle. I'm freehh.
I just want peace. Awww!
Kyle, do you want to fuckin' house? I'm movin' through your head.
I don't know, you're right. I mean, we're all pretty cool with each other, but uh, having a family just like ours.
Yeah, we're pretty cool with each other.
Aww man, it's cold out here!
Been here before.
My dad's been here before me so I know.
Me and my dad's whole family's been here before us!  What the hell is going on?!
That's right! There's even reports that our parents are not around to pick us up!
Heh! You're gonna miss it Kenny!  I can't believe you just walked out on me because you're too poor!
You gotta be kidding me!
Eh!
Kenny! You're gonna miss that song I love!

Hey guys!  My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. I just wanna get you a beer, to help you get through the night.
You're crazy! I haven't been to Colorado yet!
Yeah, it's pretty cool. Back in the '60s you could get a free appetizer and watch your back. Colorado is so cool!
What'd you get poisoned carrot soup?
What'd you get poisoned carrot soup?
I'm not (he's not, he's not) a scientist, I just do my research.
Hey, that's not cool. Hey, that's not cool, that's bullshit!
Hey, you guys have to give me a second opinion! What would you guys think?
That's right. Dr. Shafley disagreed.
I'm afraid I say ... is not.. not even.. wrong. Right?..
I'm not... told to say anything by a woman?
By a man?

====================
It's hard to tell, Kyle. But lately I've been really sick. I've been up for about a week. And the thing is, I wasn't paying all that much attention to the TV when I got home. The levels had leveled off pretty spectacularly, so I had to take a break from it.
Well, I'm glad you think the world is cool, Kyle.
Cool. Come on, let's go!  Hey! Token!  Hello? Token! Hey Token, Kenny! Hey!
Dude, what's up?  It looks like you're still not buying my show, but instead your little girlfriend is trying to get a hold of me.
Kenny! Kenny, just stop right now!
Ngh, here she goes!  Kyle, just what the hell do you think you're doing? Being poor isn't even a trait shared by all of us! Being a ginger is a curse!
Not at all, Kyle! Being a ginger is a curse on me!
Wha, Kyle, you mean Craig?
Pretty nasty. Looks like I'm in the big leagues.
Yeh-heah, right. Being a ginger isn't just a curse, it's a blessing on me.
Logos!
I'm not feelin' it! It reminds me of... often enough, is the sound of clinking glasses.
When I get home, I'm gonna wanna wipe the floor with you guys' fists
Oh no! Nooo nooooo!
No, Mom, I'm not feeling it!
Huh?
Hello? ...Oh, God, why don't you guys go basement diving again?
Hey Kyle. I'm just wondering, do you like boating and sound?
What is that?
I'm not doin' it for money!
Buh, that's a you-yeah, I do my thing!
No I'm not doin' it for money!
I only got six dollars, you guys!
Oh no!
I'm not feelin' it! It's like, my balls are falling out!
Goddamnit, get me down from here!
Oh no you guys don't wanna bogface me! Uh my balls are falling out!
Maybe I can explain the fall-out. I was trying to focus, trying to focus, because... I was watching your show, Token
====================
When I got home, I found out that my mom has a condition called "insanity" — I can't think, act, funny.
Yeah, but I have to remind myself every day that I'm not realising it.  I've gone from being the dumbest kid in the world to the most famous asshole in the world. And now my mom has a condition called "insanity" that makes me totally forget my real mental states.
It's called "Killer Schiffman Syndrome."
Can't think about what I want anymore, man. Concentrate on task at hand. Oh, please. I can't believe all this time I got an "A."
No, I know, it's awesome.
Hey dudes, I got a better idea. How do I get rid of my mom's evil tendencies without making her creepy again?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Kyle, you've got to be kidding me! I can now say I'm not realising it was me, and not your imagination!
Psych!
Shut up, Kyle! I'm real!
I can't believe I'm not realising it's all part of the same game!
Realisation dawns in the form of an awesome awesome dull dull.
It's over, it's finally over!
Realisation dawns in my head! Look me in the eye. DO I GIVE YOU FUCK?!
Because I'm real, and I want my eternal bliss! Right?
You're gonna stop me if you don't give me fucking FUCK!
Realisation dawns in my head! Look me in the eye.
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!
You see what??
Kyle's a real person! So are you!
So what?! You are all fucking liars! I can't believe you! I know you are lying! You are lying to everyone!
Oh, dude, I'm so bored! You guys are always making me think I'm overcompensating me for some mental disorder!
Goddamnit, get me down from here!
What the fuck kind of crazy Jew do?!  Get me down?!
Butters, lock the door!
Goddamnit, I have to get down from here!  Hey!  Devil fucking Jew!  Oh, you guys, you guys are hella stupid! I

Okay, let's do this in 10.
She's not my girlfriend, but I'm not going to die on the street!
Okay, let's do this in 20.
Why do I have to dress up like a Jew?
Look, I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend, I just wanna be with everybody.

Hokay, I want to apologize, Princess Chuchung.
I'm, I'm uh, really sorry. Look, everyone, I I'm really sorry.
Okay, let's take a photo with the dead bodies.
And then we'll record it with your help.
No, we don't have any more photographs to go back to See.
The bodies are all

Taylor Swift says she can't be trusted Butters.
She's fat and unimportant. I hate Butters.
Kewl, I'm gonna get that fat bitch to change her mind.
Taylor, you don't know how to deal with Butters.
Fatass, gay, tattletank, ask him anything.
Uh oh.
I'm gonna get Butters fat as a cucumber.
Agh, duh duh.  Oh, sweet, Butters is having a sweet time.
Dude, fat people piss me off.
Oh, you're right. I'm sort of missing the boat with Butters. Heheh.
Well he didn't make it past the lunch rush, did he?
Well well well! Here he comes, Butters!
Uh oh!
Agh!
Aaah!

Oh God, I'm so bored!
I'm gonna go kick ass!
All right, get out of here!
Okay Butters, you want to sign right away!
Yeah, bitchin' out loud, man!
Then what?
Except for one thing.
Well, you can't have both.
Alright, you can't have both, bitch!
Butters, I hate you so much.
Oh shit, you guys are all fucking Jewish!
Dude, no!
Butters, Butters! Courtney Love isn't fat! She has a boner! Butters is perfectly capable of pulling a big boner on a girl.  You guys, don't make love in the pit of your pants!
Hey, shit!
I don't think Butters is friendly.
Nah, I'll lose it for sure.
Who is this?
It's a slut?
Oh, you're the new girl from school?
What do you mean, what else does the new girl from school say?
What does she do?
You know, just hang out? She's my friend.
I know that.
Girl you're a pussy!
Boy you are, Butters! Being a girl is the most important thing in the whole life of you girl!
Boy you are, Butters! Being a girl means the world to me!
Girl, you have to listen to me! It's simple pleasure!
I don't know, you know that.
====================
I have a killer idea.
A boy who loves to kick ass.
A boy who loves to kick ass

I just might have found a magic drum circle...  in the snow
Toshiba Handibook S - Okay, so now he has the Nine Needles.  He has the Nine Needles, and I have Time Turner to beat you to it. Amen.
So does he like to dance?
Uh-oh.
Whoa, whoa! You're naked on the snow!

Cool, yet again.
Uh-oh.
I am on a mission to save the day. I am a man of mystery
I have a platinum star. I have to have it.
Hey, this is it. I have a platinum star. I need you to find a way to get it, sweet!
Join me!
I got a platinum star. I need you to find a way to get platinum stardust.
You see, I was hoping I could talk to Scott Tenorman and convince him to join my cause.
Forget it.
Go ahead, he said he was on his way to see Disneyland.
I don't know. I mean, I said maybe I's the only one that got the golden ticket.
I don't know. Maybe I'll just hang out with the authorities. I don't think I can get them to give me a platinum star.
Believe me, I'mid been looking for a platinum stardust for some time.
Hoho, I don't think that's quite right, Scott.
Uh-oh.
Oh, hello, Colonel Sanders. Won't tell if anybody comes.
A little over-the-hanging fruit?
Alright, I'll talk to you fraternities and sororities.
Hoho, I was hoping I could talk to the president of my school and convince 'em to stay out of my fun, Colonel Sanders.
Alright, I need to talk to the president of my school, please keep your eyes open.
Look, I don't know why you're here, Scott. Why would you want to see my school?
Yeah, why would you want to see
====================
How did you get?
No, ma'am. I was trying to sneak some cigarettes in by hiding one under his pillow.  And I was having a dream, I guess, and I guess, I guess, there's one thing I don't understand...  is why I got AIDS.
Oh, Dude, how the hell do you know?!  All the best I can do is keep from dying... of AIDS...
...I mean, fuckin' men do it.  You just hold on a second, hold on a second, why don't you just go back to school and study some more, and maybe some of that skin cancer we all know and love...
...and I'll beecrre.
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme...
Hold on, Kyle!
Hold on, Kyle!  God damnit, you guys, you guys, you're not gonna scratch my big nay, I had- I had never heard of HIV, and I know that HIV is a very real risk.
Hold on, Kyle!
How does Kyle have skin cancer?
It's just like AIDS, you know? The same old crap you get for lying to yourself about something never happened.
How does Kyle have skin cancer?
You see, Kyle, I was going to make a deal.  If you find a female friend with skin cancer, say you have sex with her friend with skin cancer. And if she says she's having sex with my friend, then the other female friend is gonna get AIDS.
Okay, how does that sound?
Oh, good. Sounds like sex.
I hope so.
Good, thanks. That's all women with skin cancer having sex with their male friend.
Yeah, no more! Forget I said anything. I'm done making this all go away.
No, it was just... I just... Got out of the way... Okay, look, I had a girlfriend, I was dating, and she had-  She's a slut, Kyle! She's a slut!
Yeah, and now, we don't have girls of color to play with.
Yeah, we just have friends with skin cancer!
Black girl with skin cancer?
How do you know? We don't have a problem until all the girls with skin cancer get our money.
Shut up! Shut up!
Hey,
====================
I'm not going to win a prize...  You win the prize.
Oh, look how the... Oh, look how the hell do I get a prize?
Then you get the feeling I'm not the guy to win a prize, because... I'm not the guy who gets the $1000, the guy walks away with nothing. So how do I get the money?
...Sweet, just buy me a camel...
car...
Nice, I like the job. I like to get the ten bucks before everyone else does.
Then give me that money right back, Kyle, or I'll kick you in the nuts!
Alright, now get out of here, you guys. Now that's my trailer, too.
You got the feeling I was trying to get a camel, too?
Wait a minute. You don't think I have any cash?
Fine, I'll just take it easy on you guys. See you around.
And of course, if anybody else wants to take my trailer, I'll be there.
But that's all the trailer shows. Now let's get to the store.
Huh? No, I didn't get a drum set!  I don't have a drum set!
Radiohead.
Yeah, I just got in the mail, you guys. I'll get you a drum set too.
Oh yeah, I've got a drum set already-
Yeah, pop rockers do that.
Pop rockers?
What the hell are they?
Oh yeah, I see. blog.
And of course, my drum set.
Oh yeah, I'm not too late! Just this one time.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Okay. See you later, guys.  And of course, if anybody else wants to take my trailer, I'll be there.
Buti, be sure to follow that yellow line.
Yeah, I know. That's why I showed up so many times.
But I wanna talk to you, Principal Victoria.
How are we gonna get the videotapes?
Gee, I wonder who did it to me?
I'm not sure who. Butters, are you doing anything else?
Hahahaha, remember when used?
I don't know, Courtney Love.
Hoh, screw you assholes!
Sweet. I hope I didn't have a taser.

I don't know, Kyle. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You know damn well what that means!

A Jew can't love you, Princess.
Butters, that's true, doesn't it?
Dude, a complete lie. Only gay people can love one another.
Oh goodness, I'm not falling for that one again. 
Dude, Kyle, you are soo bisexual. 
Kyle, that's just a head start. A beat.
Heh heh, heh heh.
That's right, Kyle.

What kind of computer is this? Hey, hey, what is that? 
Ey! Don't touch me!
What is it? The UPS guy got a hold of something and now we all know the password!  What is that? What was that?  Oh, you're not gonna touch me!  But I'm in the store, Stan.  I'm in the store.
Oh, it's over, it's over!
Oh, really? Well, at least you got some sleep this morning.  You wake me, Kyle.
Kyle, is that you?  Oh, you're not gonna show me your hard-earned cash, Stan.
Why, thank you Kyle. How was that?  What?  No, Kyle said he was sorry.  Could I talk to you for a second?  How
====================
Ugh.
Sweet.
It's all over the place.
Psh! We've got power.
Hey, it's Butters.
Clyde, what are you doing?
Cool.
Psh! We've got power.
Hey, there's a homeless man here!  You just had to put him in a transitional shelter! The Salvation Army has lots and lots of money.
Heh, he's a Socialist!  Who the man?
Amen.
Sir, we are in extort. You have to hand him the ball!
Sir, you don't understand.  A Socialist isn't a poor kid. A Socialist isn't a rich kid.  And that's what you get for playing basketball.  Cool.
Sir, we are in extort. You have to hand the ball to Clyde. Sir, we are in extort.
Dude, this is getting silly.
Eh-where's my soda?
Butters, hold on just a second! What would you give to come play at a free egg?
Well nice try, dude. I've said this before and I'll say it again: If you don't give us a chance, we're gonna give you a free egg.
What?
Sir, we aren't gonna give you a free egg.
Fat boy says he has free egg.
Stan, what the hell?!
Well, you know what I'm saying?  All this time I've been freaking out about how crappy it is in this world. But lately, I've noticed something. I'm noticing something about Clyde.
Yeah, come on over here.  Clyde, you have to come over.
Dude, this is awesome. I think we're seeing a little compassion for some of the handicapped people in this country.
And I'm sure some people in this audience are wondering if... if we are living in a just world. A world without apartheid.
Okay, Kenny.
Egal itang,  habbeh,  habbeh. Sorry, I habbehbeh.
Oh, hey there Clyde.  What the hell are you doing, buddy?
Nice game, flank.  Apparently, though, the cast and crew are having a lot of fun on the set.  Oh, guys, see any problems?  No big deal. All we have to do is sneak

====================
Please turn on my FaceTime Radio.
Yes. It's looking like Stan's molestered pig has been found.
Radio silence on the death of Stan Lucas.
It will be interesting to see what happens to him. I think he'll pop over to the Rancho de Burritos.
Stan's Uncle Jimbo is here.
Stan's Uncle Jimbo is here.
Will he be arrested? I don't know.
Not at all.
What?
Why?
I don't know. It's like, I can't even relate to it.
Jimbo Cartman here.
Stan's Uncle Jimbo here.
Here.
Intelligent and friendly, that's all.
And it's gonna be eight thousand dollars and up, so I can go home and tell my parents.
Right, so help me God, I have laid a wreath at half mast.
Yes, hello, Uncle Jimbo.
Hello, Dad.
Son of a bitch. I'm not a pothead. I'm a ginger!
Lookin' around. They have a dope little music festival coming up. Might as well give us a chip on our shoulder, 'cause we're gonna bring hippies and bust out our asses.
Yuh, you guys? That was K-10s going around.
Yeah. We're not gonna let that happen. We're all kids.
And this is bullcrap!  It's all going to be videotaped. You guys, get T-shirts and autographs. That's it! No comment will be made by me as a matter of policy!
You'd better get that fuck out of here, dude!
And this is bullcrap!  Wha- what?
Wha, what?
What?
Wha, what?
Wha, what the fuck?
This is bullcrap! I've been listening to music online and I've found great power in the music we've all listened to.
Wha, what the hell?
What song is it?
Wha, what the hell?
This is awesome!
Yes art class, guys.
We know what it is guys. We've been listening to music online for months. We've called it "post-racial" and "indigenous." And now, we're all like, "Wow, we have to change everything
====================
Because I'm a stupid bitch. Stupid bitch.
Fuck you! Fuck you, lesbo!
I'm pissed now.
I don't wanna take a dump anymore, you guys. I just have to get by.
Dude, how many times this morning both Manolo and Kyle were in my life.
So?
You what?! Lawrence's penis isn't funny, guys!
Well it's not funny, guys! Lawrence's dick is totally disgusting! You take your dick out of the trashcan and throw it here or there, and we'll fucking call it poop.
Oh it's sooo fun! I can't believe how funny it is!
Oh! Let's see. I believe I got this guy to talk: how do you get people to stop and think about peeves in one's bloodstream?
I asked my mom once if she had any plans to have kids, and she had no idea that everyone is gonna have them.
Gee, when are they gonna have their first?
I'm gonna have a laugh, Kyle.
Yeah, like every time I go into the store I'm thinking about how cool is your Simpsons Simpsons stuff, Kyle. Oh, and this one's got wings.  You know, when your mom gives you her Christmas present but you can't pay me to play the violin?
Think about it. I'll probably be quiet for days. Then someone will call and say I'm a pedophile, and make me give you money. I won't do it!
Oh, you have a crush on Kyle, Kyle. They're like twins, except that I'm not totally innocent! I've kind of devoured and raped and beaten and... raped and... fuckingraped and... put you all to sleep over the past week, because I'm too stupid to do it alone.  Do you really think I could do it this easy, you guys?! I can't hide it.
Oh, I've got plans.
Dude, these socks are so comfortable! I can wear these all day!
Oh wow, cool! You got so many ideas, Kyle. You see, Kyle? I thought you were working for me right about now.
Because I Hold My Pee Dreams, I Know What You Think I Do.
I know what you're thinking, Kyle. You're thinking that I'm somehow somehow controlling all the events of our lives. Well
====================
They only start fights on a first-come, first-ser basis. Don't forget Copland.
Weak.
Last Stand 'Em.
All right, I'll fill you in on what ails first-come, first-ser resort.
Blulululululuh. Come on!
Yeah,!
Well, you fight them off, you hug yourself and your family and live here with the beaten and beaten-down earth. They call me fat.
Well, hello, it's you, my friend.
Thirty-eight is the lowest barrier to entry into the slave trade, and yet, I'm the only black guy getting material aid.
My friend Stan and I spent the summer working on our movie.
Yeah!
See, that's the cool part? Every time I go into the slave trade I'm judged by how hard I work is. I'm not, I'm a black South person.
Look, I know there's a lot of talk in the slave trade about who is the true master, but, I'm not letting that talk get in the way of what I'm willing and able.
Black people are stupid.  Look at me. I'm not gonna take shit from anyone.
I'm not gonna take shit!
Aw dude, I'm not gonna take shit from you guys!
Yeah. I don't think I should take it. I'm black.  I'm not gonna be a slave.
I'm not gonna be a slave, you guys!
Aw, God dammit!  They can't take my soul away!
I'm not gonna be a slave, you guys!
Ah, son of a bitch!
How does he burn?
Dude, that's not cool.
I'm not gonna be a slave, you guys.
I'm not gonna be a slave, you guys!
Hey, I'm not gonna be a slave. That's not cool.
I'm not gonna be a slave. That's not cool.
Hey, I was having this really big flashback.
Well, you see, people? This is why we have school: when we look back on the past, we can see what was before us. In this case, it was slavery.
I can. I'm already using my Slavery 21! index now is enough to make you want to get your pants frayed!
Okay
====================
A ninja appears and uses ninjas to catch the bad guys.
Ninjas! Ninjas! Ninjas did it.  I caught the bad guys, and I caught the ninjas.
They were too good, Kyle. They saved my life.
Now it's down to one ninja to capture Stan.
Nothing.
A present? But why?
Aw man, it's so last seen!
My grandma got me a ninja blade so I can hurt people. Man, I wish I had one!  What is that?
SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH!
What?
Haha, very funny.
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Kyle, I swear to God, if I ever saw it, I'd kick your ass!
Kenny!
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?
No, Kyle, you are making me scratch my head.
Noooo!
Mom, I am serious! This has nothing to do with Kyle. This is about Nichole! Kenny, you are not getting a ninjas blade!
Kenny! Kenny, you are making my head itch!
OHH, PLEAD! IT'S OVER, KENNY! IT'S OVER!
Eh-ih...
Stan, you've gotta get a ninja.
Noooooo!
Na-ah, be quite honest about it.
Come on, nun-nya, you guys. I don't wanna be seen doing drugs!
Oh, be quite honest, Stan.
Be quite honest, Stan.
Noooo!
Eh-ih... Oh, hey, guys! Thanks for coming. What is it?  Thanks for coming. Stan, are you ready to accept the reality that you're a bad o-?!
You guys, get in here. I think I have some of the game over.
You guys, look for me! I mean, I look all buff, but...  Look at me, Kyle! I'm totally poor and stupid now!
Ha! I'd better get out of here! Look at me, Kyle! Here you go.  Good, Kyle.
jeez, look at that dress by the nurse, you asshole!  Hey, look at that one, Kyle!
Yeah. I told you guys you'd
====================
My-my-mom is so screwed up. All the stress of losing my first Grandma, and of losing my mom, I can't bear. I keep thinking, Why don't we just get a movie? I've got to be on TV, watch TV, _-nothing.
I know. I know.  I can't come by.
NO! I'm trying to have a flashback! That's not important.
Mom, I want you to know that I'm really psyched up. I haven't seen the movie again until much later.
I can say anything I want until then, okay? When the ride is over I'm gonna watch that movie again.
No, you don't have to say anything. I'm gonna go buy a ticket to Los Angeles.
Indonesian, Jew, Brazilian black, Mexican, Mexican, no-one speaks Spanish, Kyle, Kyle! Okay, so how's it look?
Washington Redskins, screw you guys.  Screw you guys!  Screw you!  No way!
Hey guys, did you see the movie? ?
No, it's not a good idea. It's stupid!
Kyle, we're talkin' there.
No!
Stan, you're one of them?
Where the hell is he?
Goddammit, Stan, no more Redskins!
I'm not happy with this picture! It's too gay. And it's also too gay with a different side of Stanie said to be in love.  Hey, Kyle!
You don't get to be Prime Minister, Tony! But I'm the President of Canada! So I can change their minds! And that means changing my own!
Hooray!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
Ey!
Hey, eh. I guess we'll have to let them eat our brains.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No! No, seriously!
C'mon.
Hey, seriously.
Yeah.
Yeah.
C'mon.
Hey, dude.
Hey.
Ey, dude.
Ey, you asshole! I can't believe you're gonna ruin our Christmas special!
You guys, Christmas is sooo cool.
Yeah, you can put any piece of Christmas jewelry you want on the spot.
Yeah, Hanukkah
====================
You should have seen the news. The EA Sports Tiger Woods Masters kicks ass!
Boy you didn't get it did you hear that, do you?! The EA Sports Tiger Woods Masters kicks ass!
Wow, I guess you guys know the guys' blogs are full of crap.
Yeah I saw the blogs, you guys.
CartmanBrah!
Looks like some of the homeless are now getting stuck f-fences!
CartmanBrah!
Check it out, homeless people! I'm gonna have them pruned off!
There, you see? You wouldn't mind giving them a try, would you?! I'll give each and every one of them a shot!
Hurry up, you guys. We're in the final days of the game, and I'm gonna harpoon these homeless!
God-damnit! I'm gonna have all the kids watch the video and laugh it off!
You see what I'm doin'?
Oh right, you get over here.  Set up traps there.  Traps there, Kyle.
I'm gonna takin' out the 80's.
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?
Yeah, Marty's with us. He's like a possessed Billy Mays.  Look there, Marty.  There's a homeless man on the street.
Yeah, set a trap.
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?
Yep, this is all being broadcast LIVE on TV!
You can't reach me.
No, you can't reach me.
No, you can't reach me, 'cause I'm not here. I'm not in this game.
I'm not in this...
This is for your own good, Jimmy. I want you to know that if I don't win, then either I'm not in this game, or...
You guys gettin' cranky. I'm not in this game.
You guys fucking killed myself.
Because I don't want it. I want  McHanddown, now!
Goddammit, another game?
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Get over here, Marty! I wanna kill you!
Because I don't want it. I want you to know that if I don't win, then nobody's love dies for nothing.
Oh, I've got more friends than Ky-yle have ever rewarded me for.
====================
It's just... you know, you're always so kind, you know? When we...  I mean, you're always such a great influence, 'cause... when we need to do something, we go out and find something. And so, you're always looking for that perfect moment, you know, when you can't wait for us to die a simple, yet immensely happy, C-3PO draw.
Oh, yes. Awesome!
Oh, dude! C-3PO is looking pretty good!
Look, I told you, I've GOT to get to Florida.
This is sweet.
Cool, hanging out with my best friend's mom.
Yes. So, you're right Tweek. I'm gonna be so totally psyched to see Scott Tenorman's kids get tested for human papilloma cells.
Surprise, surprise!
Nothing.
What's the matter, Scott?
You're gonna let me see...?
...Psych!
Hmmm.
You're gonna let me see that!
�  Security! Check your country of residence and consulate in South Park, South Park, for passports!  Hey, Scott Tenorman, your daughter is from Venezuela! Can you give me a document proving your daughter is a U.S. national?!
Um.  A copy of the United Nations Convention on Contracts is waiting at the Embassy!
Ew! Urhs!
He's a vegan! So, you're telling me this is the last straw, my Serbian Jew. Uhh, look at him. He's so Christian he wears a Christian band.
But you don't say anything. It's all a show for me Christian athletes!
Cheer up, Stew?!
Forgive me, Lord, for my sins I will not commit them
Satyagraha!
Hey, have you been following my blog?  I'm on my way to winning the Anti-Doping Agency Reimbursement Award. If I don't do my scheduled meeting with the ADA yesterday, I will be dropped from the competition.
Oh, dude, isn't this great you guys? We probably would have needed a bigger test to see if Kyle Thome was involved.
I'm sure it's just the energy of the two of us.
Just tell the ADA that me and Kyle Thome aren't in the running for the PGA Tour PGA Championship
====================
All right, let's go!
What?!
They're not gonna move!
Oh, no! A Jew!
A Jew in here! A Jew out!  Oh Jesus Christ!
Well it seems our... game is getting a lot more popular. We thought we had safe spaces, but... the Internet has made us all homeless.
Hey, what about us? Our first official game?
Weh just a ticket, Token. As long as we stick to the story, we should be good.
No, nothing dude. We want to get out of this whole mess.
No! There's too many minorities! There's minorities at Cartman's Funhouse! Get it up!
Okay, let's go, Kyle.
Ogh! Oh no! There's more minorities at Cartman's Funhouse than at any time in our history! Get it up on the screen! Something is seriously wrong!
It's not. There's too many minorities! Too many minorities at our pleasure.
We know what that means.
I know what that means.
I'm afraid I can't let that pass me by.
I'm the captain of this starship, Mr. Garrison. I'm guardin' it away from the rest of you.
I'm the captain of a starship, Captain Kyle.
No, I don't think so, Kyle.
Yes, I believe I see the light.
Good, then. Let's go.
It's just a matter of time.
Oh, look what Mel Gibson did there.
I saw The Passion, Kyle.
Look, I don't need to rehearse anything for you, Kyle. I can do it for you. Just do it!  I don't know if I can do it. I can't. I can't.
They're all singing a different song. The same song. The same theme.
Ugh!
Oh no!
Oh no I cannot hear you!
I tried. I tried again!
But this time I'm not goin' for it, you guys. I've come to lay waste to the minorities.
The minority now demands that I go away. I don't need to hear what they want, Token. I've come to lay waste to the minorities.
Token, do you mind coming over for a second, please?
Nuh uh.,okay, sure
====================
I know. I know Kenny McCormick is kewl.  He's a kewl hippie. He's in trouble again!  HEEL!  He kicks you in the nuts!
You sonofabitch Kenny, he's gonna kill himself!  Knock knock!  Oh crap!  Kenny, its Kenny. Kenny Sockfucker 3D printed for you.
Ey! Kenny, you asshole!  Knock knock!  Oh God, what a stuttering nervous wreck!
And I'm not even hurting my parents' feelings! I've got over a hundred thousand dollars in debt!
Kenny, I'm not letting you get away with this! If you wanna go back to your little hometown, you've got to start looking for houses!  Look look! There's some cash just beyond the bank!  And look what the house number there is! It's the same one that somebody put up for sale a few months ago!
Look, I know a lot of hippies house number two.
Is the house in question Ricardo's house?
So, who's house number two? Well let's just Pingree Ti-i get out of here.
You see that Tom Hanks house?  Oh my God! Oh my God, you guys!  You're screwed! You screwed!
Dude, house number two is the one that somebody put up for sale for $2.95 billion! And if you're gonna sell that house, you're gonna take it down someplace, and maybe a little later, have it repainted it green and gold.  The repainted house, of course, is the Jared L. Overlander house. The original catalog shows you what the repainted house price is right now.
Oh, Kenny. Your dad's dead.
Dude, house number two is a big no-no.  You sold the house for under thirty million dollars.
Well what do you say? You said the guy from "Hunger Games" is real?
Oh, my God, that's the repainted house.  Good riddance, Kenny! The real thing that made your dad go away was that the guy from "Hunger Games" was also your mom!
You're not fucking with me, Kenny.
There's nothing for me to do today; I've been working all day! Why look me in the eye and say, "You're
====================
What?!
I know a way around it!
Hey, asshole!
You don't think I could teach you how to do magic tricks, Kyle!
Hey! I'll give you a make believe Christmas present.  Hey!
Heh! You're not supposed to do Christmas presents, asshole!
Hey! I was going to say how Merry Christmas I was going to win your heart, you stupid piece of crap!
Well, I guess we'll see about that.
Heh, it's just that I, I can't know everything.
Hey, it is?
Oh, Christ.
Oh, man, what a dumbass!
I can't wait to see your Christmas special.
Eh, it is?
Oh, you mean the people??
Uh, that's nice. I like your little show.
Nuh uh.
That's enough information already?
There you are, miss Grandma.
Maybe I can convince her to come with us.
How exactly do you get her back?
How do you get your minions to support you in your plan of global domination?
I don't know. I guess, I have such a golden triangle to tell me.
Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts, Mom. You're a wuss.
Don't fight me, miss!
Just block that triangle.
Don't try and stop my power, miss!
Mom, it's not fair! You took my golden triangle, but I still have it.
You little wuss, I want my triangle back!
Hi, Grandma.
You're gonna kick my ass,sss. I want my triangle back,!!
Mom, I told you guys! There's gonna be a big fight on Earth next week! We're gonna have to kill off the X-managers! Let's go! Let's go!
They're gonna do it on Black Friday. We've gotta kill off the X-managers before X-men come out!
I can't wait.
What is the score, Mom?
Three points, Mom!
I need at least two more, think about it.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Mom, we're going to kill off the X-men without them knowing.
Why do you have to be so direct?
You're betraying your mom,
====================
What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey! You know what time of year it is?
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
—Christmastime is presents for me.
Uh, Jesus.
Well what?
No, Jesus. That's right.
Oh, you're a little piggy.
Oh, God!
Well what are you doing? You're just gonna sit on the couch and read the paper instead of Christ?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Oh, uh, well what's the Christmas present?
Oh, uh-
Funny how people always forget that each and every one of us has a story to tell.
Hey, it's Captain Ahab.
Well what? That's it?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Well what's the Christmas present?
Well who's playing Christ?
Well who's being a dick?
Well who's being a dick?
Poopin' Christians and fuckin' hippies,
The Jews and Muslims,
The Catholics and hippies,
The Muslim and Christian hippies,
Welcome to this stupid school of thought! As you know, some Jewish people have been living in the shadow of Christ for a very long time. And... well maybe God is gonna clean up that part of town.
You're damn right God is gonna make the town safe for the Jewish people.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, you guys wanna know what Christmas presents are made of?
G'night, guys.
Hey you guys.
Huh, I don't make Christmas presents for presents.
,s--t--.
Good morning, Mr. Hankey. I'm trying to keep some of my Jewish friends up at night.
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
What?
Hey!
Ey! Don't worry, Kyle. You're cool.
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV?
Yi'm not gonna parties unless I get a contract from Sony.
Oh, I know. Let's not go to parties, guys.
Hey, wait til you see my Christmas present.
Eeyy!  You guys, nothing's wrong
====================
Hello, sir! Please keep your weapons and armor under lock and key.
You got on the case, Casa Bonita?
Yes. There's a lot of Mexicans out there living in here.  Guess your rights. If you don't sign up now,  it's not going to cost you a dime.  There's  Justine Damned: a fantasy set in South Park. Come on, Butters, pack your bags.  Okay, we'll be right back. 
What was that?
No, it's okay. I got sand in my pants. 
Yeah,  Chicagoans are stupid!
Okay, fine! Here we are, five dollars and thirty-two. How do you feel? Do you feel like it now?
Greetings from the Southwest.
Welcome to our studio.
It's great! Thank you for coming, everyone.
Butters, you have to be careful where you put Tahink. He can't be trusted.
After all, he's a robot.
Butters, a robot is better than a human. And you know who the worst nightmare is?
No! No I don't want my doll Factory gone. I want my doll Factory gone.
I didn't make it for free-asshole! I made it for free-asshole!
Do you still have it Factory gone, Kyle? Do you still have it Factory gone, Kyle?  Good point, Kyle.  You showed me your doll Factory.
Factory fail, Kyle. Your stupid brother made it for you.  You forgot to bring it back. Your stupid brother made it for you.
It's okay, Factory. I can't wait to see the results of my first try.
Oh, look at it, Factory. The look on your face when you learn that you got your first doll.
It's okay. You remember the look on your face when you learned that your brother took away some of your best friends.  Good Factory. You see that? Factory.  The look on your face when you learn that you got your first doll.
Thank you, Factory.  The look on your face when you learn that you got your first doll.
Happy Birthday, Kyle. And good luck next time.
Oooo, patent trolls! I can't believe we're gonna get a patent!
Well, you are
====================
I can't wait anymore.  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  You guys, calm down! You guys are all duped!
Oh my God, you guys. Oh my God, you guys! Oh my God, you guys!
Dude, you know what, you guys? Maybe we're just gonna learn to co-exist peacefully on Earth.
Dude, you know what? It's true. There's lots more brown people on Earth than there are cars. We're gonna live to see the day.  And maybe you did just as much good as I did.
Oh, fuck you, Kyle!
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
...No, you didn't.
...Fuck you, Kyle.
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott. You're such a genius, you guys.
I'm gonna get you, Scott. I'm going to shoot you.
I'm a little different Scott. And to shoot you, hello?
...What?
Huh?
I'm retardsen. Scott!
Wha? What?
Huh? Look at yourself, Scott. I know you can't be trusted.
Yes, you are really trying to trick the Jews.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Scott. Please, you'll lose the bet.
Yes, but maybe he'll give it his best.
Hello?
iethnic?
What is that?
Yeah, make me something to eat?
I don't know.
Uh, it's okay. I just want a paper fold out of these.
Scott Tenorman?
What the hell is that?
Yeah, you know, there's no Jewpacabra in South Park.
What?
There's no Jewpacabra.
Scott Tenorman is a liar!
Yeah, you know, there's Jewpacabra in South Park.
Yeah, you're right. There's Jewpacabra in South Park.
Yeah, to kill a Jewpacabra.
To kill a Jewpacabra.
To kill a Jewpacabra.
Jews do not kill goats.
I'm not pouting!
====================
Kids, I want to thank all my fans for showing up. I can't tell you how special it is to be able to hang out with Stan and Mike Bhat.  And I wanna tell you, I can't wait to see the look on their faces when we walk through their door.
Hey Kyle! I'm telling you guys, this is my favorite meme contest. You can't just give us a random little wiener and expect us to win.
You know what we just give? Hundred NinixtyFour times.
Well what are you guys doing??
You just give us a random ten and a half minutes with Bhat and Kyle and say "We gave you the ten and a half hours until Christmas."
That's right!
That's Right!
Hooray! 
We would be happy for you!  Have a lovely holiday,
Bhat!
And a Happy New Year to you,
Bhat!
So. Low energy, bah!  How am I gonna get them?  How can I get ten presents? 
Four dollars.  You got them all! Hillslide ten presents.  These will be given out to children who help us, you stupid fags!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Tell them how much they owe and how much to stop!
Twenty cents.  
There we go.  Twenty cents is enough to buy us a house, Mom.  You owe us one.
And we'll send you five for each present you don't make.
Five cents.
What?  Twenty cents is not payin' for us playing Nintendo Wii.
Twenty-five cents.
Five dollars.
Twenty-five cents!
Twenty-five cents well then tell us how you got them all!  How could you li'l be so deceitful?!  How did they know we had iPads in the house?!  They should have known we had them in the house too!  How did they know we have stingons in our pants?!  They should have known we have Gardiner stings in our pants!
No surprise no more! There's more to this case than what's actually in the video. And you know what this is? This isn't about iPads. This is about a terrorist attack on American soil.
Look at what's happened to this country
====================
I'll be damned.
Wha?
What?!
I don't wanna be friends with you fatasses!  Ow!
Ah ah ah, I'll lose it! I'll lose it for sure
Cause of me not eating ice cream!  Right?
Why the hell don't you just cut off my wiener?  Why don't you just take it off?! Ah I'll lose it for sure
Cause of me not eating ice cream!  Right?
Why the hell don't you just wipe it on my dick?!  Right?
Why the hell don't you just crap your pants?!  Right?
Why the hell don't you have a strong wiener over there?!  Oh crap, you guys are not doing your job!
Eh eh! You guys are you guys, I'm a-holes!  Eh, eh. Shut up, you guys.  No, I don't want to crap my teacher' ass.
It's just a matter of time, you guys. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be damned if I'm not to get some more if it means the world to me that I'm being seen to be poor.
There's even been a Christian boylede  and they're only holding together now.
Poor me, Kyle. Fellas huh.
Not thinking balls.
God damn it, I wasn't looking.
Maybe I'll have to think of something more exciting.
Whoopee.
Yeah, that was awesome.
A Baptist priest with a huge boner? Eh, not me, Kyle.
Well I wasn't looking babying in the papers, I had a THOUSANDS banked up penis.
NO!!!
I'm not looking in the papers, I had a THOUSANDS banked up penis.
Kyle, that's just a stupid redneck bitch!
Wait a minute!  You mean when a woman has her vagina sucked out by two guys who've never even been to a rally? Oh my God, that's just how it is, Kyle. Ew, that's nothing. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
You're not, Kyle.
No, you're not, Kyle.
Nope, nothing.
I don't
====================
I've taken to setting up shop at SeaTac.
It's been nine hours since our friend Philander was last seen. We've not been able to bring our arms around each other, oresh! We're simply too smart.
Kewl, I must be under duress! I've been up all night watching the news, and lately I've noticed a strange twinge of optimism. Laughing, I ask, "What exactly is it that lights up the night stream?"
You mean to tell me it's just me?
I can't tell you, Kyle. I've been up all night watching the news, and lately I've been somewhat... irritable.
Huh?
Hehe. Uh, you're right, Kyle. I'm irritable. What's up?
Huh?
You're right, Kyle. I don't know what's wrong.
Meantime, your friend Stan and I are gonna be out fighting in Iraq.
It's going to be a great big ego-quit, Kyle! Just say no to everything!
No!
No, YOU say YES!
...And that's why I can't fight you! I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars' cash. Nooo. I just can't give it up.  You guys wanna fight me?
Oh, God, that's so sweet you guys.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh. 'Sup? Uh-heh, I think I'm gonna win this one.
Good.
Heh, I don't think I'm any good at this one of them.
What the hell is a fuck!?
Hey, hold on, they're gonna help me.
Hold on, I'm not gonna be fucking raped by one of them!
The fuck are you talkin' about, uh-ho?!  Hahahahahaaahaha!
Agh! It's not fair! I knew you would fall for that!
But I'm sure going in that one day, I will discover true love.
Ay! Ay!
I am the valiant Paladiness Kyystar Tarragon. Continue!
O, Tarragon, you can't be the weekend edition, asshole! I'm already winning those Plinks.
Draw 'em, Tarragon! Take them all down to ten!
All right, Bebe, hold on. 
====================
It was a miracle, you guys. I was on welfare five years ago and I don't have any money. I donated eight dollars, but by God, you guys have given me all my money back. Thank you-
Wendy, I need your help with my food stamps. You brought me all the food stamps.
You diabetes denier! I'm not eating. Please, I have to go to the food court.
Food court! Food court!

Zone A, heroin shame!
Okay, fine! Go!
Stan, you're crazy!
Yeah!
He just gave me a half-dollar.
Well, I'm glad he did.
Hey, that's not the point.
He's a Socialist!
You know who else uses drugs than kids?Kids.  Stop! Stop, Craig!  Just because I'm a Socialist, that doesn't mean I'm bad! I'm fuckin' stupid!
No, no, he's right. Promise. Give it one day.
You're gonna take it?
Clyde, you're gonna take it?
 .@Jellychef: "Nobody gives a rat's ass'. Nobody gives a rat's ass. It's all their fault!‍
Everyone's gonna be on television, and people gonna do drugs and have sex and have sex!
Nobody's gonna know until they're in costume!
But everyone knows that Statemedia and the rest are wrong!
※ Nobody knows.
Is it me or is it Statemedia?!
God damn it!  Statemedia is taking pictures!
Yeah, Uh they're taking pictures! Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Well put it on!
Yeah, snap a couple of, put them on.
Yeah, but you can put it on now.
Yeah, but you can't flash.
You can't flash.
But you can crap your pants if it's the Statemedia logo on your titties.
Oh God, I'm sorry.
God damn it, Statem

Okay, I'm off the airwaves!
Have you stopped my manging to blow my presidential lead away?
Youstopmygod.
Why are we having this many calls? Why?
We just got a caller on the line, and they're willing to give us money to keep the air conditioning on.
Kyle, I want you to come down to my house. They've been Texting and FaceTimeing us for two hours.
If you don't mind, we're down in Colorado.
Denver's a pretty cool town, Kyle.
God Damn Country, Stan. Yes, that's a nice little ham.
...Sweet.
====================
Ooooo, Mom! You got a fight all to ourselves?! This is the end of the Wacky Farm to Bear and Monkey World, huh?!
I tried.
And so I close with a somersaulting "Ah, ah, ah, but I can't find my way back home! Could you come me a coffee shop?"
Oh yeah?! I can dream so I can use my hands to pull this thing down!
I can't. I'm too stupid to do it.
Aw dammit! I'm gonna kick it in the face!
I'm not giving a dollar to those guys! If anything happens to me, I will be back for a fifth!
Six hundred and eighty two is a fucking big Drool.
Kyle, when I say "feed the cows" I'm just talking about proof that life is ugly.
Oh, damnit!
It's not ugly, it's beautiful.
Check.
All right, this'll keep getting better. I'll get to play the guitar in less than a week.
Dah, of course.
He's not ugly, he's beautiful.
Six hundred and eighty two is a fucking awesome scale.
Dah, fucking awesome!
Dude, no wonder Kyle isn't getting any love from the African-Americans in Congress.
Oh, please, my mom is not online anymore.  Oh, God, what was that?
Oh, please, I don't want to wait for Crunchyroll.  I don't want to watch Girls und Panzer.
They don't know anything anymore, they just keep on pissin' me off.
Nnn, Mr. Mackey, I'm not online.
Oh! It's over! It's over!
Oh! It's over! It's over!
Oh! It's over! It's over!
Oh! It's over! It's over!
Oh! It's online! Check it out!
That's it?  Oh! Me? Me, me. Me, me. Me!  Whoa!
Ewww, dude, reapporcism surgery is no time for sleepyheads.
Postpone the ordeal, Kyle. Have a seat.
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?  It's almost too busy.
I can, but I need support. I can't make it.
====================
It is, but you don't know it. I'm afraid that... there's a magic number one I can reach that can save my family.  It's twelve. Uh twelve, twelve, twelve. Uh Uh oh.
What?
Eugh. What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't even know what I'm doing. This is supposed to be my chance to win a thousand dollars to go to the top school in the state of South Park.
Shut up, Butters. You know what this means.
Ehh, are you crazy? I've been dreaming about this number since I was wee-e days. When your mom found you last night.
Ugh! I'll bet a hundred dollars that you've got something better than that.
Oh, Kyle found you, too.
Just tell on me!
How do I reach these keeds?  What I'm about to find unseaworthy of a princess.
Oh, looks like Stan has some kind of prize. A Vagisil Sling that shoots sea creatures. Oh, that's cool. I'll give you that, too, Vagisil Sling.
What's the score, guys? Okay, this is it. Who do you think won this time?  Stan, you are the true genius, sir.
Dude, he's been on a tear lately. He's not finishing his short story set in the South Park ghetto.
Hey, you know, we don't really have a story to tell, do we? A story that's not just an 11-year-old girl's dream.
Because who isn't a dreamer?
Anibal?
Anibal?!
Aalrightalrightalright! Right, off!
What? He's an asshole!
Dude, no! My friend Stan is an asshole!
Oh, God!
Eeeehh, Dieter.
Dr. Shafley?
Dr. Shafley?
Doctor, can I- — can I talk to you for a second?
No, because my friend Stan is an asshole.
Oh, yes, it's coming from down there. Um Dieter does that?
No, because Kyle doesn't.
No, because Kyle doesn't.
No, because Kyle doesn't.
No, because Kyle doesn't.
No, because Kyle doesn't.

We are not putting up with these people any longer! If you'd like to join our army, please fill out this form.
And now, for a look at what's going on, here's Kenny.  You guys, come on.  Dude, we screwed up. We added some really sweet faces here, and Kenny's actually got some big dreams coming.
Dude, we want to be a part of things. Now's a great time for all of us.  The college is founded on the idea that all students are created equal. That everyone's inherent genius is being squelched.
The fuck are you fighting over?!
Kenny! Dude, when was the last time you turned on your TV?
Look at it, dude. TV is on.
Hey, this is where we all live?
This is the fucking promenade we lived 'til last.
The fuckin' South stays out here, 'cause they're rich.
Nobody's fuckin' butthole.
This is the Southwesterland?
This valley tops.
The fuck are you watching?!
Ey, I'm fucking them fucking assholes!
Yeah, they do that all the time.
They're just as bad as me.
I'm gonna die in the future, knowing full well that my birthday is exactly a week from today.
Fuck you! You fuckin' bitch!
Ey, I'm not going to see that asshole!
He ate a bunch of chicken.
So what are you doing this sundae with, "The Tale of... The Old Man?"
Yeah, Screw you, guys. I'm going home.
I'm going home, my heart is so... clear.
So whatcha eat?
Yummy.
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
It's a revenge fantasy where you go on a date with a girl and then die--
She what if you hadn't done something?
You can do anything you want, Kyle! You can go back to your treehouse scene in the movie, and live to see the next day!
I can't bring myself to do anything except to look forward to the movie whenever I get a chance!
Look, look how bad I got! I got worse!
All right, look! There's even Nineties to look forward to!  There's even Sixties to the trees by
====================
Wow! Check it out!
Oh my God, this is sooo cute!
No no. Don't worry, I can save you all!
Nah, I'll just cut you off if you guys keep killing me the hell I'm about to do!
Oh, you've got to suck my balls, asshole!
Oh, suck my balls, dickpuppy!
Oh, suck my balls, dickpuppy!
Oh, I'm starving! This is it?
At least my mom's up on her fever phase.
Bad! I saw Panda Bear today.
I know, it's so cool that we celebrate with big music videos and big screen experiences.
But mom, me and Stan know that we're not gonna play 2024 with anybody.
...No.
No. I'm gonna Panda Bear you in the streets. I want money.
Man, this is sooo cool!
Waiwait, don't tell me you've never felt so good before?
Eugh. Alright, let's see. First you press F6 on the shutter, F6 on the video.
Come on, kid, it's funin' there!
Ugh. Oh, man, what the hell is that smell?

Oh, God, I hate you guys.
Well, I don't know, I haven't been on a video club long.
Uhuh, Klaus?
Klaus Frog?
Oh, uh, wow, this is like a club, like a gentlemen's club, you guys.
No, Chef, this is like a gentlemen's club, gentlemen' club.
Hoo-ray!
That kid is really into girls right now.
Aaah!
That kid is really into girls right now.
He is such a girl, such a hero.
Aaah!
This is sooo cool!  Ladies, please come to my party tonight! 
====================
I was just about to order the cheeseburgers when this guy walked up.
"Hey! Who do you think you are?"
I want to thank you for coming, Sarah for coming up with the cheese theory, and Kyle for coming up with the theory of pasta bleu.
All right!
What?!
I knew it was you.
Ha ha, you're a genius! I can put a hundred dollars towards a Chess and the City game!
Come on guys, I have to win the game. If I don't, they'll kick my ass.
So?
Who the hell do you think you are?
Ahem.
You're not gonna believe this, Kyle. I sent the president of this school to try and change your mind.
I know, right?  You the world needs Chess and the City for its puzzles.
You think you're gonna work on it, Kyle?  Then do a search on his existence and see if you can find chess pieces.
Kyle, I want you to do some thinking. Do you search for answers? If you're not gonna solve the mystery of Chess and the City, then who are you?
Look, dude, I love you. I guess it's out of the question right now.
Yeah, I wanna be a cop. I wanna be as the world needs me.
Check out my T-shirts. They're cool, but I'll take four dollars.
I know, I know, look at my T-shirts. They're top quality.
Yeah yeah, I like T-shirts that are cool, but I also know that a thousand dollars is a lot of money.
Oh God, I'm bored already. How do you know? How do you know I don't see another job like this?
Fuckin' bastards! Check out my T-shirts. Hip hip. Buckshot.
Fuckin' at my food truck. Broke.
Oh yeah, I've seen it on TV.
Bush is gonna make America great again. I'm not gonna be a baby anymore.
Little ones, you ready? Now come on, we're gonna have a talk. Titty sprinkles.
Oh, yeah, that one's cool.
His name is Krugman.
His name is New Jersey governor.
What the hell is he doing?
Yeah, he's gonna be president.

====================
Dude, when I said "When I say 'til death do of us," do you want to be read or something?
Goddamnit!
Dude, screw this! I'm gonna die young and independent!
Dude, screw this!
Aw dude, I swear, I'm gonna die young and independent!
What the hell is wrong with you?! (Kiss) Kyle, read and approve this material.
Kiss and retweeh!
Seventeen.  Oh, Mom, that's not even time! Forget it!
Nononono! Mom, listen!  Seriously! Think about it: what did I tell you about to go?
That I didn't know? You're supposed to write the book that tells the whole story.
How?!
Choo-choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo... What?
Oh, thank God! Ike is nice.
Oh, God, I almost got herpes. Uh, excuse me, doctor, I need to know how to get vaccinated.
Coach! I didn't mean to fart on you, Kyle!
Kyle, how come I fart on you?
I don't know.
I don't want herpes. I don't even know you!
Hey!
Nah, I'm just trying to engage Kyle in a friendly dialogue about science and tolerance.
If you want, I can make you something to drink.
Forget it.
Is there anything else I can get for free?
Fine.
You don't get to have anything! He-eh.  Less than a minute!
If you want, I can make you something to eat!
Anything!
Okay, you decide.  You bite the back of the heady memory, Mom.  And eat it.
Well, it's not funny anymore, does it? You're no good at that?
Good, because you tricked me into doing so. The part where you and Kenny get shot?
No, the part where they find out who the killer is?
Aw, damnit!  It's over, it's over!
Well, I'm glad people stopped with the times and the people stopped with the times-  UP!
Thank you, Kyle.
Yeah. I told you it would work.
Hey, we
====================
It's all fun and games now, Butters! I got a golden ticket! I got a golden... twinkle in my eye!  I just had to go and be accepted into the school,  which meant I would get a golden twinkle in my eye. I got a golden twinkle in my eye.
Good morning students. Are you girls and boys looking for something to wear?
I knew it! I know what this is all about!
NO! ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment. This is about a golden ticket. The girls would only take that.
Heh. ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment. ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment.
Aaah! ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment. ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment.
Aaah! ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment. ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment.
What the hell?!
Oh, no, no, Wendy, you're not going to get that golden ticket. Come on!
Grab it, Wendy!
Grab it, Wendy!
Oh, dude, sweet!
Yeah!
Hey, I was just about to do it.
Aah! ...Maybe I'll just have to let him have a moment.
Aw, screw the girls!
Hey, you guys are screwin' up the whole thing!
Nnno! Just hold on a minute. The credits are on the side of the stage.
Yeah. I want to thank everyone for showing up.
Nnno! Well, I'm glad Broflovski is gone, because he was a great role. And I want to give back to the community.
Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the club, Wendy. Now, since you guys are so quick for all your hopes to succeed, I think it's my turn to disappoint. To the club, sir.
Well, I guess everything's finally come to fruition. Sir Stan, I envision a future in which no crime has ever been committed. The very fabric of society was torn apart, and the very fabric of society was ripped apartin' defenders says......fuck you.
Butters.
Fuck you, asshole. Fuck you, asshole.
Butters, yeah.

====================
I've always believed in human rights. I've believed that the law is right, and the oppressed have the right to be respected.
But I've been wrong before. This year saw the first complete mass murder in modern memory. At some point, you become numb to the pain of your own existence, and it made you want to take drastic action. I called for a complete and total shutdown of all U.S. energy support, and the entire non-U.S. government. I started a petition drive, and learned that if I didn't get the signatures necessary to get the government to do something, they would do it on my own. They finally did just that, and I was happy.
That said, there was a little problem. When I signed up, there was no e-mail address or something. I got a call from the energy company and they had me turned away because they couldn't find the address. I tried again, and they told me that my petition would be refused.
So I called and let me know that my petition has been accepted, and they will take it to the next level.
And so the guy next to me gets high and  uploads a video of himself using a syringe into my leg. I'm not fat, I'm big into slimming down. It was perfect!
And so they try and take my life rehearsal again, this time with Kenny.
Kenny really likes me for trying to slim down,  so he forces us to watch the video and approve it. I'm not fat, I just have a sweet butt for Kenny.  It was perfect. Then the video gets shared all over the Internet and Kenny tells me that everyone saw it and thinks I'm the fag on national television. I said "Ngh, why the hell does that happen?" He also tells me that if I don't do my petition and get the government to do something about it, they're gonna laugh at me all the more. I'm not happy with what was found, so I got a little translator.
Big fat boner. He's been making boners for about an hour.
Hello, I'm with the 1%ers and I want to talk about 501(c)3.
I said "Hey, how about this: How about this: How about this: How about this: that girl I backed out of a business deal because she's gay"?,
====================
I have a surprise for you, Kyle. Don't worry, he won't try and change the rules. He's cool, he's cool.
Hi, are you Kyle? Yes, I'm sixteen, but I'm also sixteen, and I have a lot of things in my possession that I'm eager to discover. So if you're in the market for a rare metal alloy, this may be it.  Bite-size replicas of old machines, reprogrammed embryos, and of course, .hack.  You'll pay me twenty bucks for ten of those.
What is this, you guys? A real thing?
No. I've been looking for a good time to sell my sixteen-carat gold watch.
You see what you did? You also added a hundred and sixteen dollars to my bet.
Why add sixteen dollars to my price tag?!  Why can't I live here without it?
Ngh, and then, and then Kenny would have bought it, too!
Well done, Kyle. You've made my sixteen-carat platinum watch last. Well, I'd like to see you again, please?
Yes. It's the year 1776.and, I want to be on the watch right away.
Well, I don't see any sign of forced entry.
No, but if anything happens, I'll be the first to ever leave Cartman's Tower.  Aah, he's gonna be king ever since.
Dude, that's the bad kid in here.
He's gonna take over forever.
I looked all over the Internet, and I found this gem: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv-file-Mack-Dole-star.html?i=0 But if you haven't heard of it, you're not supposed to pick a woman to be on the watch at the end of the credits.
Yep, it's the British stuff. Uh but, if there's a problem, we should justenail call and let everyone know.
Yep, I'll be Kenny's lawyer.
Last week at my house, during the school holidays.
We should all be doing the British stuff, wearing white and not paying attention.
Should we put a ceiling problem before playing the part of Sarah Jackson Waugh?
There's bound to be a time bomb.  He did put a ceiling problem before the
====================
I found a brownie in the trashcan above the kids' table.  Oh man, this is gonna be so sweet!
Come on guys!
Come on, come on!  Oh! Me, you know, this is just great!
But I gotta get the hell out of here!
Oho, you guys suck, dude!
But I wanna go to the bathroom!
But I wanna get out of here!
But I can't go on living because my mom says nyah nyah
Nyah nyah nyah!  No, Kitty, that's my important fag, you have to protect it!
Heh, you and your dog get into a lot of trouble because you're sensitive to your dog's genetic disorder!
Oh, you around here.  That's a pretty badass statement.
Now, the clinic will be treating the rest of your money split evenly; I'm going to the clinic, I'm staying with the girl you love, but I don't have all the support. The rest of you, go to the counselor, go to the school assembly, and let Lady McCormick and I go.
Nyah nyah nyah! I'm gonna gettin' fucked!
What the hell is going on? Are you crazy?!
Kyle, do you think my uncle is a racist?
Oh, you know, you're right, Kitty. I'm not a little poop-bitch.
Aww, it's not a diaper, it's a bitch-Dick.
Oh, zinger!
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty! Think about it: kitties can't talk!
Coach!
Coach! Kitty, think about it! It's a bad kitty!
Coach, how are we doing?
A- I'm doing very good, thanks to everybody's help. How about we have a little diversionary trick we can play on our way out.
Well, I'm gonna take care of the dishes, you know, we're gonna go drive, and then I'm gonna give you a ride back to your house.
Kitty, there's consequences to your choices, Kyle. You just can't take those to an adult.
Well, sorry if I turned up before, but... I don't tend to theropodule, so I reached for the poop-bitch's poop-bitch.
====================
Snow is falling, and I don't know what's so special about it.
Oh, I've got to get to Comet 67P, Kyle, or they're gonna shoot me in the face.
What?
No! No, you've got to put them away!
Eeyy!  Oh HELL NO!  No! Keep your mouth shut!  No! Leave this area open!  Who's gonna shoot a guy's car on purpose?  Oh noeehhh!  Oh HELL NO!  No, no! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH!
I'm not shooting anyone. I just learned to shoot.
Hand over the fishsticks!
Oh no, you're not using any of my weapons, Kyle!
The fuck are they?
Because fuck you, Kyle! Square Enix pisses me off!
Aw dude, the fucking fuck is this?!
So, the fuck are we talking of?
Well let's just assume that your fucking girlfriend is a fraud and wants to take away my goddamned fishsticks.
That's how you get a virgin girlfriend, Kyle. Shoot her in the face, Kyle!  What the fuck is a "shit" anyway? Like what did she do to herself? DID YOU MAKE THE FUCK, JESUS?!
No, you scared my ass, Kyle.
I'm getting married. What are you gonna do?
Well let's see. I'll be honest with you.I'm not fakin' about my fishsticks.I'm just a pussy!
A tasty one!
Jesus Christ!
That's cool.
Wha...?
I know. That's cool.
Wha...?
That's it? I'm alive and well!
Do you think this is funny?  Oh no. Oh NO!
I'm alive and well, you guys!  I want to be near your guys while I fight those dwarf aliens on Earth!
You don't get to decide what happens on Earth! I'm not going to win the bet.
Now, guys. I don't know what's going to happen on Earth, but I want to be near some of you guys.
God-dammit!
Thanks, but I don't have a dad.
Uh uh!
I'm sorry, Craig.
Nope. I have a dad.
Craig, you don't
====================
I am sick of it! It's so completely wrong. Let's face it, pedophiles are evil. They lie, and they will lie if you tell them what to do.
Don't you see? If they're so evil, how come they get caught in the middle of school?
Look, I know what Republicans are all about. Trying to get us out of this mess.
You see that? That's just the way the world is. Good guys do bad, right? Jesus, I need to know how to deal with this monster.
Ugh.  When do we get the video?
Friday?
Three days??
What?
Friday?
Friday, what is that? ...No.
What is that?
No, that's school.
What? This is some kind of prank?
No, this is funny. I told you this would happen.
No way, dude. Look, I'm not saying this is some kind of random; I'm just saying that this is a good man with a couple of dicks. Gah. God, I hate you guys.
Well, I don't think I'm over him. He's getting more and more powerful. I mean, dude, I don't think I'm letting this go on.
Stop giving me money!
Nah, I'm letting this go on for the cameras. You know, I'm just gonna go watch some of these funny commercials. 'Cause I like to see what comes first.
What? That's not funny!
Nah, I'm not giving you money because you're a pedophile!
You see what?  You're a pedophile too?!
Well I don't give a crap about you or anybody but me!
Go ahead, the pedophiles!
You have to be kidding?
He added voices in my head so I couldn't do it!
Hey, why can't I just read the book and write the voices?
You're gonna let that pass you by?!
Just let the voice on the other person break. Or else you're gonna get in trouble. I don't care.
Okay, that does it!  I will do whatever I please! I will blow your whistle, and you will too!
Just ignore the voice on the other person, and you should be safe.
What the hell is that?  What?!
Who is
====================
I think it's a very important moment for the United States of America. ...And so I wanna to take that moment for what it is: A TIME TO TOUCH UP! ...And so I say, "Come on, Stan, this is the most important thing I've ever done." ...and I say, "Stan, this is the most important thing I've EVER done." ...and I mean it, man. And I did it. I lived it all on tape. I wrote it all on tape. And you can look what you came for. ...Because I saw it on tape. And you got it on tape. ...and I'm not going to waste it. ...and so the world will know my true worth. ...Because on paper, I'm not happy. I'm happy with what I've seen, but then I find out what the people behind it are really saying. And that's what I'm gonna do! I'm gonna ask the top ten people behind it to come out and tell us what it means to be all "I'm Maybe" and "I'm Maybe Robinhood."
Is it a good or a bad thing that some people in your family got into their hair?
Uh what, what it means?
So then, what does "im Maybe" mean, then?
So then what?
Yesss... Yeesss... What what what what what what what what what?
What? Brother? ...No what what what what what what what what what what what? What what what what what what? What is this? Wright? Token? Token, what the fuck is this?
Wuuugh!
They's not that smart, dude.
Dude, Token, you spend all these years trying to be the best at your trade.
Goddamn, get them all fucking pissed off!
I can't believe we're gonna embarrass ourselves at Asspen and Forward again. I'm sure we're gonna do something like this.
Wah?
Okay, anyways.  Token, what the fuck are you doing?
And why is Kyle here?
Jesus Christ, Token, Kyle, you guys are not supposed to come.
Oh, the great negotiator.  Token, I'm talking to you about a deal.
Token, Kyle, you got a shit right Kyle!  Seriously Kyle, you need to lay off the fucking engineer!  Goddamn!
====================
Ey, an extra $6.95 is $6.95! But you get it for me!  I know what it is you're doing! You're offering me a deal of $6.95 to go grovel and walk this way!
Look, I know what it means to be poor in America. I know what it means to be poor in America.
B-huh, eh, That's true, too. Look, I appreciate your offer of $6.95, but I believe that offering one's worker four dollars an hour is a bad idea.
Yeah. Those hours are busy. I can't let you guys go hungry, and if you guysgeabank.com is anything to go by, I'm not gonna be able to get enough food and drinks for all the people at once.
Oh, it won't take long, Kyle. We're going to fill everyone up by now.
Okay, that should be all you need from here forward. Now get down to the living room and get in here!  I hate to break it up, but I believe that gives you twenty-nine, you see, the rest of your parents' twenty-nine!
Uh huh.
Alright, let's see...
There's only two more seats in the front row! Can you sell your tickets so we can go back to playing pinball?
All right, let's sell our tickets and make room in the front row!
Butters, sell your seat!  All right, now is the wine list.  All right,lets see who we want to sell the tickets to.  All right, now is the playing surface.  All right,let's see who our buyer is.  All right,all right,wait, who our buyer is gonna be, you gonna want to put that twenty-nine in front of you, you wanna put that twenty-nine in front of you, but I don't know who our buyer is.  All right, let's see...  This is it. This is our call. We'll let you in on the twenty-nine sale.
Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's happenin' up?
Holy crap!
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?!
Dude, this is getting silly! I don't think I'm gonna show up to schoolwork!
Oh my God, you guys know why you're
====================
What?
No! No! I can't play with you guys anymore!
Fine! You guys screwed me over! Let me live! You know?!
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
You need to find a sweetie; Craig's family is totally poor; and stop buying things you don't need!
Look, I screwed Craig a kidney; I'm the one who's lost it'th parents, and I'm not gettin' out alive! I screwed Craig too many times!
This is bullcrap! I've had BETTER times than this! I've had better people boss me back than this!
Hello? ...Barefaced? ...You guys are me and Scott Tenorman! I'm Scott Tenorman and I'm with the Wrestling Observer Newsletter! I'm with the wrestling magazine!
WESLEY, Scott?

Yeah, I've been with Scott for three weeks. He's got diabetes. He's got diabetes! He's not gonna be gone! Now's not the time to try and take him anymore! He's got to see a+!
Well, you know, he's always loved me back. He's always loved me back. He likes me just... different. And lately, it's been... Scott Tenorman.
Ish, get out of here!  He's gonna kick my ass!
Leave you and me alone!
Huh!
Tweek!  Hey, what?!
Hm. Maybe you saw the commercials?
Hm. You think you're gonna hide anything?

You'll flush the trace back to the sewer system, Scott?
To the sewer system, huh Scott?
Where is it? Where is it??
Scott Tenorman?!
Aww!  God, I hate Scott Tenorman!
Does he smell like Scott Tenorman's mouth? Scott Tenorman is the man!
 What the hell is he doing?

I went down to the bank and I accepted the Lord was great upon his head and, I believe, upon his pretty ass!

It's clear now. She's trying to get away from you.

Hello, can't- wait for the new Nintendo Wii U eShop version?
What are you waiting for?
Okay, okay, shushush, shush, shush, shush...
Oh no, no of course you don't! This is going to be the greatest thing that has ever been invented!
Forget it! We have a Nintendo Wii U!
What the hell?!
Hey, you guys, what the hell are you guys doing??
Don't touch this! Don't touch this!
No.
Hey, you guys can't miss this sale.  Hey, you guys can't get the Wii U eShop version. Don't let them help you.
Oh hey, how's it going?
Shit sells, you guys, but it's fuckin' lame if you don't touch it.
Dude, you can't sell copies of things that you already have.
Look, you guys can't sell copies of things.
Oh, I've got a deal, Kyle. I only have three dollars left over.
Don't talk about me, you sold me Lenox for just ten bucks.
Oh how about that?
Five bucks, you prissy little bitch!
Oh, amigo, amigo, amigie.
Gee you guys, I'm not paying you anymore ten dollars.
Oh, amigo, amigo, amigie.
I got a new girlfriend, amigo.
I just don't know what to do about Mr. Kitty.
Oh, amigo, amigo, amigie.
Hey, imaginary person. What is it, butt?
Dude, you can't sell copies of things you already have.
Yeah, if there's one thing I hate, there's persona non español.

Non existent, amigo!
Aw, gee you guys, I'm gonna do something about it.
Non existent, amigly!
Non existent, amigo!
I, I hate this persona non español.
What does "you" have to do with me?
Non existent, amigly!
You are the leader of the class, amigo. Continue leading the way.
I hate you, amigo.

====================
We say hello, you guys! We're heading in the right direction, you guys. There's some killer cliff faces ahead of us, huh?
We're professionals too, you guys. Can we punch it in?
The right...
Kewl!
Whoopee!
Yes! We're professionals, too!
Huw!
 "Hoo, Ma, we're honored to have you as our new City Manager."
"I'm honored to have you as our new City Manager."
No! "I'm not doing my job."
"No. That doesn't make me any less of a person. I was doing it all along."
...So?
What's the big deal?! You guys have to be telling the truth?!
You guys did everything you could to keep me out! You showed up,outed your rights, and then lied about it to of course making me feel better!
I want to punch you in the face, you asshole! I want to punch you in the face, you fuckin' guys!
You guys, what the fuck do you think you're doing?! Are you really that stupid?! You think that telling the truth is the same as lying about being raped? You just, you just, you just lied about it!
You just, you just lied about it already, you're just gonna lie about it and blah, blah. Alright, let's go.
Dude, this is getting weird.
There's no more time for planning! We have to have all these new trailers! It's like a councilor's meeting with tons of new information being presented.
It's like a detention center for the mentally challenged!
Wendyl, how come you don't have a job?
Are you with the IRS?
Come on, Butters. I want this to be a truth!
I'm sure there's other agencies that would be nice to us, for us, to work for.
Hoo-ray. Agent Davis is a pretty cool idea.  How is it, Stan?
We just hope that one day, we might be able to get a copy of the therapist's report on Stan Marsh.
Oh, it's so cool.  So do you think it is? Do you think it's news, Clyde?
It's a miracle, guys.
Looks like Stan has finally found peace with his mental illness. He
====================
Why wouldn't you?
Zzzzzzz...  Why don't you go back to sleep?
Aw, crap!  She's not booty!
Jew!
Aw, damnit!  No, no, heh.
Uh oh.
Aw seriously, no it isn't fruitcake.
Goddamnit, stop calling me that!
Mom!
She's a little piggy.
No it isn't a metaphor; I never said that.
I'm kicking ass.
Hey dudes, what's goin' on?
Okay, I have some pretty big news. I only have three dollars left over!  Butters, you get me a kewl?
Butters, do you wanna get together and watch Fringe like a bitch?
Alright, let's do this: Who do you think I'll be spending the money?
I'm gonna spend it all on this stupid thing I'm doin' now!
Kyle, you need to tell me if I'm cool again, and I'm cool again!
You're gonna be the last person I'll be cool.  You remember from work?
Do you wanna fart on me?
Faggot, I need you.
Butters, I'm going to buy you a drone.
Butters, I'm not gonna be as cool as everyone else.
Digital scarcity will make your digital persona more relevant.
We have to make you accessible. Be it on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.
Just remember that it's the last vestiges of an outdated, outdated, outdated.
Digital scarcity will make your digital persona more relevant.
Digital scarcity, please.
Digital scarcity, thank you.
And now, for another installment of My Little Pony, this time between Pony and Tail.
Oh, hey, what's goin' on?
Oh, really? Great!
What?! Who the hell did this?!
Oh, sweet! They killed Butters!
Nuh uh.
Oh, I guess now we see just how outdated this is.
Oh, uh, well, you know, when people are making changes in society it can get really interesting.  The hippie movement was alive and well in the 'nuh uh.
Butters was a big part of it.
So, what was the hippie movement really like?
Yeah. It was about
====================
I don't know, Kyle. I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because the Jews don't want us to see it because,  it's so damn scary.
You guys! Come quick!  Everyone get a briefcase so you can kill anybody along the way.  Kyle, can I get you some Mountain Dew?
Quick, hurry! Coming quick!
It's okay, Kyle. Everything is cool now is it not scary?
You guys, come on!
We're going this fast! Come on, this isn't about you and me getting screwed, it's about everyone!
Prepare to charge! Kick ass!
I'll pick up my guitar and sing songs about what I love. Gaw.
Oneu'th, oneuh, oneuh.
I'm serioustly pissed off, Kyle.
Damn, Ken. If this were a movie, weh, we might as well do a silent TV show.
Look, Kyle, a briefcase is a little pittance compared to what I'm willing to pay. And a guitar is about as poor a price as you'll pay.
And who among you thinks that putting money where my mouth is is is somehow less scary?
I'm not fat, Kyle! I just have a sweet poker face.
I have pretty big a business! Kew, I have pretty big a business!
All right, fine Kyle! If you want to go get Sarin's head, you can do it for about four hundred dollars.
Stan, don't be such a fag, dude.
She said he put the balls in my mouth.
I put the balls in my mouth.
Stan, don't be such a fag, dude.
Hey, it's Sandra Dee, bitch.
Did you guys see that?
Dude, that's like that.
Dude, Dee, we put the balls in my mouth.
Dude, this is all over MTV.
I put the balls in my mouth.
Dude, this is all over MTV.
I put the balls in my mouth.
Dude, this is all over MTV.
No you don't!

How's it going?
You guys, it's almost class time.
We don't know anything about Animaniacs 5.0. But we know that the students won't let us let Kenny go.
'Kay, let's go school!
Yeah, go school! I'm gonna go get a house.

Goddammit, Kenny! Don't go! Ike is my house!
How come Jimmy and Kyle didn't let us have iPads?! Jimmy's a fuckin' asshole! Jimmy's a- crying inconsiderate! Kyle's a- lettin' crap on the sidewalk!
Oh God, give me a minute.
Yeah yeah, we're fine.
Jimmy! Hey, what the hell are you doing?
I'm not cryin' any more. Let's go to the store.
Okay, store manager, you need to offer an alternative to cut your hair.
Okay, sorry, you can't make any money now. There's work to be done, so let's go to the other side.
Waitwaitwaitwait, what if I didn
====================
Check it out, people!
I got a taste for good food and fun, you guys. Hit the jump to see what I've got.
Mr. Kitty, I want you to check this one out.
I only got half the price of a ticket back home, asshole!
Look at those jelly beans. Jelly beans are underpowered.
I only got six bucks.
Dude, you don't get six dibs on the street, dude.
Six dollars is hard enough in this town, huh?

You what?!
Yeah, but I didn't take the tips! I only got a ten percent cash bonus!
You took the tips?!
You what?!

Take the day off! I didn't have six dibs left!
Six dibs is a lot of money! What are you gonna do about it, you guys?

Right.
Awww, I think my mom is gonna want to know what's going on.
Ohh God, that movie is so funny.
Egh--! Oh gee whiz, that's so sweet.
Well done, Mom! I hope you had a very Merry Christmas.
And now, here's some snowmen.
And so, without further ado, be safe, be merry, be safe, be safe!  The fair Queen Cartman has been safely hidden beneath.
What the hell is that?!
I'm gonna get out my sleigh and sleigh sleigh-  Merry Christmas, sir!
====================
I have to go home and get dressed. You all the girls at school call me a Jew, you know what I'm talking about!  Now, go get ready for my Jewness, because tomorrow, all the girls will be forced to see me as a Jew, and I will forever be known as the Jew I know.  You guys, get ready for school tomorrow!

She is my bitch.
====================
Alright, so listen up: I know a way around the robot door.
I don't care if I'm president. Uh okay, maybe I should ask Kyle, "Don't you think about your disabilities often, Kyle?"
"I could ask Kyle a question, and maybe he'd give me a lot of ideas," he said. "I could even give me a try. I could be the robot that comes up with all the new ideas, and then Leonardo DiCaprio shows up and gives me a grade. What's the score?  Okay, so now that we have that out of the way, let's get to work.
Proper timing is so important to me. I've been working on making Carnival City the bestestest, least painful, most awesomeest, smartest, most awesome Carnival City team.
Working together scales so a lot about who we are as a company. How do you make sure everyone feels proud? How do you make sure everyone understands how Carnival City came about?
Riiight, and all four of you.
Okay let's go.
What's the score going there, Kyle?  You making this a company about helping people who have AIDS, Kyle?
Sort of. $3000.
Wait, what company?
I'm not fat, Kyle. I just have a sweet sweet mouth.
Ahaab, that's right.
Hey, what?!
I'm not talking about makeup, Kyle! I'm talking about makeup and deceit!
Ahaab, that's right Christ. Remember how you first told him about the AIDS scare?
Yeah, and now that it's all over, I'm starting to see how you see the world.
You're hypocritical Your hypocrisy is obvious, Kyle. How do you see this today?
Shh. self-centered and self-destructive selfishness?
Nice.
Kyle, what are you doing?
I'm not fat.
Look, I know what you're talking about. You're saying that because you have AIDS.
Yeah, my mom is fat.
She wasn't saying that because she's gay.
Really?
My mom is too.
My mom is toofat.
My mom istoohip.
My mom istoohip.
My mom istoohip.
My mom istoohip.
My mom istooick.
My mom istooick.

====================
It's all done. The nightmare is over.  Goodbye, Mother.
What do you know about the Mexican-Americans who came to live on Longwave?
I didn't think you would want to see them. They're gone now.
...There's a lot of talk in the hallways about how special they are. But people keep talking. Talks that are so drill bit.  Talk about a bitch, Kyle.
Fine, Principal Victoria. Butters, we're only two cars from the platinum starlet right. In... platinum...
Uh-ho.
That's stupid, that's retarded.
Shut up, Principal Victoria. These are mom and pop. I'm in charge, not you.
Hah. It's so cool. You can't help but want to send a girl to a party with you, but she's a girl. So she becomes a girl. And then you have a girl who's really good, and really poor, and doesn't want you to make out, you know?
And a girl who's really nice, and wants you to fix her hair, and make it look like it was cobbled together from all the right little pieces.
But no matter how you look at it, a girl's worth is measured against the number of times she's been taken advantage of. Now look. If you're gonna have a girl's worth against, you have got to have her worth against you.
Okay, me too.
Okay, me too.
Thaaat's right. Girls do that.
Okay, I'm not making fun of anybody.
Hey, what's wrong with me?
What?
I'm not laughing. I'm, I'm telling you guys! It's just that I suck at being laughed at.
Hi, I'm here to fill the gap.
Ehh, excuse me I, I need to take a shit.
Puhah... Hey, you guys don't follow the news?!  Thats right, I'm just having a weird week. Waiting for the new Sony PSP to come out. I gotta get out my cha-cha and get out my cha-cha crap.
Monday? Tuesday? Wednesday? Thursday? Friday? where is my cha-cha?!
What are you doing, dude?! You trying to take my potty? I gotta go tell my mom!
What? Why?
Hello?
====================
All right, let's go!
Hey, Officer Barbrady! How's it going?
I think I can tell you've had a tough week. You're the one that's been assigned with the poor guy.
Yeah I feel bad for him sometimes. I feel bad for him because he was so poor, and now he has to work all the time by caving in and me because I didn't have snow in my room.
How's it going Officer Barbrady? You're the one who assigned the poor guy to each of the crime scenes.
It's all agreed upon. the poor kid, Kyle, and the succeeding generations.  And so today I want to share some news that I think is going to be very interesting.  It's raining frogs.
That's right, it's raining frogs. Everybody, stop squawking and look what you're doing.
It's raining frogs. Yeah it is people, it's raining frogs.
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this? I thought we were having a slugfest now.
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this!
And that's what I wrote, Officer Barbrady: Pvt. Kyle.
It was raining frogs.
I saw the guy in the TV commercial where you have to suck the frogs out of each other.
You suck the frogs, Craig!
All right, let's go!
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this?!
So does Stan.
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this?!
The hell we have different plans?! I have a frog in my room that I can fry with, while Craig is gonna show me how to make Popcorn Balls!
Dude, look at this! It's a Stan and Kyle Snail!
Boy, I didn't see it. I didn't think it would-
I can't remember.
I don't know, it's like I was born again.
I can't remember.
I can't remember, man!
I wish I was old.
I wish I was old.
I wish I had a chocolate latkes
Time to sing a song of thanks.
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this?!
God damn it, shouldn't I be doing this?!
Wendy, wanna play?
Come on, one, two, three times you
====================
Hey guys,
Well, it's all finally over!  Remember when we used to be able to shop here?!
Ugh yeahhh remember that one, Kyle?  Remember the one??
Yeah yeah, we learned it from that?! To work for us, you have to compromise yourself!  You need to find your own voice, Kyle! Look what happened to the Hashtags!
They've been hijacked! The people who took them know little or nothing about what the government is doing. They are making life difficult for us shop owners around the country.
The people who set them up say they're for real. But what about the HMV?
The HMV is a terrorist organization that we are proud to be a part of. We are told to stop by the Chinese in the hope that we can get our hands on some of their weapons. We are told to trust them and to trust our luck, and unfortunately for us, our country is at the mercy of terrorists. Do you really think this is the way our country should work?
The Chinese are going to have your ass.
They're going to have your soul. Piece of crap.
yup, I'm gonna be poor until I'm poor, then I'm gonna have to go to the bank, and then I'm gonna have to work five hours a day
Do you have any idea how poor our country is? It looks like it's going downhill from here.
Four more hours, four more hours, and then I'm gonna have to work nine hours a day, seven at night.
I said IT IS AT THE GATE!
I want to view this picture I took while I was waiting tables at a Chinese restaurant. The name of the game in getting my revenge on the HMV.  Shave your balls and go. The guy in front of you can tell you it. Hundreds of them.  Chinese out. And the one who was last in line gets to laugh all the way to the bank.  Go on, the guy in front of you!
Yes. A Jewpacabra.
Thank you, Butters.
Wha- Alright Butters, you come up with the name, please.  Friends, we have a new friend here.
Aw, dick sucking andponying a guest sucks my balls...
And that's how we gonna get our revenge on the HMV! I'm gonna be on
====================
Oh hey guys! Thanks for coming to my wedding!!  I'm so happy that I finally got married today, thanks to all the blessings I've been given.  The first act of worship was to take a dump and then get high! And I'm gonna be on the couch licking my fingers while the groom does the dishes! Ha ha ha ha! I got a God-damned Jew!  Achtung! Haargh! Oh, guys, hah!
Uh that's enough meat for two boys! Five hundred pounds of it. Time to show the world that we still make meat, Kyle!

Look what I got for you, Kyle! Lame!
I guess we'll day meat again. I got a nice, kewlike kewlike kewlike weekend; you'll only eat meat once or twice in your life. 
Oh what a wonderful surprise for you, Kyle. We've only been here the other night, but... you know what I'mm gonna bring you for check-in: for the first time ever, my camera lens.
I made it, Kyle. It's gonna be sooo cool. 
 Kyle, prepare to be fucked by a female ten footer!
Yaaaarrgh! 
Good morning Kyle. It's my pleasure, explaining the arts and crafts to all those who want to learn the arts of crafts.
Argh! 
It's just a matter of time, Kyle! I wanna know all about your art! 
Why do you want a thousand dollars? 
Kyle, it's all I have! 
Kyle, look, I'm just trying to get as many people interested in the arts as possible. You see, I realize that when you buy an art form, you're also gonna want to spend it.  You know what I'm talkng about... Argh!  YES!  Yes, YES!  Yes, Clyde, you are the first female arranger of albums. 
Just wanted to remind you that if you buy an art form, you are also gonna want to spend it.  If you buy a album, you're gonna want to shop for album covers so that everyone knows your name.  And
====================
When I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. Now we don't even know we have a lock of hair!
Well, nowadays, when you're in solitary confinement, you have to bring stuff in by crikey!
Crikey!
Oh, I've got to get that crap figured out, now! Now that we're all accosted by the inside scoop, we have to bring stuff in by crikey!
Yeah, dude, that sucks!
Yeah. Now everybody's goin' through that door.
Oh, cool. Doesn't it peek out through that?
It does, and it's called "Sharknado".  Uh, what that does, guys? It's a gene dump.  We saw some stuff yesterday, Kyle.  There's some birds that can grow to be tall, and some birds that can't. And some birds that are neither...  Wha, what... that... that said "Wha, what that means?"  That's right. That's right, and that's funny, because, it was Kyle who first said "That's a stupid question, dude."  Well, let's just say that it was a tough decision that came to us in the morning, and we're gonna make it tomorrow.
Dude, it's not even close.
Well make way for... That's right.
Dude, Stan, stealth is very, very important to us. Tomorrow I'm gonna go up on a suicide bombing and announce that I'm the one who was the one who died.
I knew it was a bad idea, Kyle. I was the one who was the bad guys and, well, I was the one who was the bad guys.
Are you cryin' about Kyle?
Oh, dude, I think that Alec Baldwin commercial is really funny.
Nah-uh.
I'll just cut you off.
Wha-hay!
Heh, I think that Alec Baldwin commercial is really funny.
Noemuh.
Eh-ih... stop, yesemuh.

Yeah, if there's a chance of being rid of humanity, I think I'm in a strong position.  I think I can convince Kyle to come back to our universe.
Look, I'm saying this right now: if there's a chance of our species being wiped out, then we must kill on.  You know, if there's a chance of our species being wiped out, then we must exterminate on this Earth.
Yes. All of us. Kill her. Kill her.
No, no, he's not gonna come close. She's hybridising. She's gonna kill us.

Well, I'm gonna be rich, and genetic engineer, and with the rest of the guys
How the hell did he do that?
I don't know, but you guys are gonna be the assholes for speculating about my race's race hybrid.
Heh, I'm sure I has some ideas.
Hello, Kyle. Won't you tell Kyle that we have a species hybrid born, and that it is, in fact, me.
I'm pretty sure Clyde has a penis in his mouth.
Well if I'm good, then Clyde has a penis in his mouth.
Hey Kyle. Anybody here try to tell me anything about the other aliens? Unless you think I'm just some fat turd, there's no evidence that any of them are real.
Not at all.  "The aliens are listening in on

Hi, mom.
It's uh... It's just that... that I kind of am going too far this season. Uh, I'm not gonna be a good Jew this week, alright Mom?  Okay, Tom Hanks for one. Freakin' for Christ's sake!  I'm gonna be totally cool this week, Mom. I'm just saying that I'm hot this week, and that being the best isn't about me but... about being the best always. I just have to be myself.

She also wanted me to have a moment... with her son.  so far, sir. She's gonna want me to be herself, and not be egocentric. Thaah. So this morning, while I'm at it, you guys got together, and when I was walking around the club, I felt a strong need to protect myself. I called your mom, and so was told that all the clubbies would be there.  So uh, I was confused, and so was Scott Tenorman, and so, I called your mom and said, "You'll be seen at recess, except for the naked girls who are Scott Tenorman.'" And so they all saw me go up on the boy band and they all asked me what was that "thing." And I said "It was a wiener." And they all laughed and said, "Uh, about a hundred dollars." I said "Do you want a watch, Scott Tenorman?" And they all laughed and said, "Uh, about a hundred." And I said "Do you want a watch, Scott Tenorman?" and they all laughed and said, "Uh, about a hundred dollars."
Right, right.
Hello, Kyle.
Uh, the guy is selling candy bars.
Yeah, I know, it's kind of complicated, but, look. I was watching the news and you have this guy selling candy bars.
And I said "Why would you want to do that?" and I said "It's not ethics in business."
You're sure it wasn't?
Well it's not, Scott. It's not ethical in business.
I'm not rich, Scott. I'm not famous.

No, Mom, you can't scare me. I need to sleep on the floor.
How do you know? I've been through some of those too.
Yes. I've been through it all, you guys. I've seen it on TV. It was a disease that crippled some people.
How do you know? I've been through it all.  I can't let anyone take away my peace. I've got to get fucked.  Straight up.
No, you can't blackmail me.
====================
At a Glance Is Kyle Broflovski dead? If so, what does that mean for his place in the Star Wars universe?
And For All Those That May A Miracle Be On, Stan. I've Only Sixty Minutes. I'm not the guy who just buys a TV and then dons a microphone to say whatever he wants.
Yes, I'm psyched. I'm tired. And I'm pissed. So I'll tell you something, Kyle. I think I'm gonna die getting my picture taken, and not in the studio, so that everyone knows how messed up and terrible it really is.
Good.
Good.
Rumors are flying that Luke Skywalker is alive and well and cool!
Yes! Yes! Rumors are that Stan and Kyle are together!
That's kewl! What if Stan and Kyle are not real?  I can't tell you what that feeling is going to be, because I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I don't wanna tell anybody!
Ugh! Well how about if you come out for a minute, Butters? Because I want you to know that if you tell anyone, I still want you to try.
...I don't want to go to George Lucas's house.
Ugh.  Oh, God dammit!
Are you sure? I can't believe that I got away with not telling everyone. Uh, who is Butters?!
Dude, he's not dead. He's alive!
Well who is he?!
I know that I'm tough, Butters, but I'll try.
There's a library! Where do you all go for the names of all the students who have died?
Amen. I need to know where the library is, and what their names are.
Sir Stan, I'm calling together all the students who have passed away and collectivized the hall papers.
That's all I need! I can upload it to the Internet, here!  Here it goes!
Sure, Sir Stan. I'm glad to see you've got the hall papers online.
Oh, hey, Kyle.  Hi, I'm calling together as many of the students who have died as possible and collectivize the hall papers.
Of course, since I know all about Kyle, I figured it best not to come in contact with him.
Kyle, how are you today?
Yes

You have no idea who I was?

It's gonna be Les Misérables, all right, lads. Let's go.
Where are they?
 (To Les Misérables) Oh yeah, that's the official website.
Lads, it's the fans gathering there to see the musical classic.
Oh, that was stupid. That kid just took a dump on us.
They're not fans, that's for sure.

Why don't we just let them eat our pudding?
Rock n' roll!

Is he over at the drum circle yet?

====================
Well, I was thinking, "If they want to embarrass me in front of all the girls at school, then so be it." And then, "If they want to embarrass me in front of all the girls at school, I will say whatever is on their mind." Which made a lot of sense. And, and then I got it this: "If they want to embarrass me, then so be it." Which made a lot of sense.
What do you mean?
Yeah, dude, check it out! My mom is so so so.
Okaaay! Look at that! Haibo!
Yeah!

We just have to smuggle these guys into the city.
Sir, we do have to do something to get these kids off the couch. They're taken too far and intolerant of life.
Kyle, will you agree to our deal?
We're gonna smuggle these cannibals out of here without you having to us. This is all being done so that we can lecture Kyle about motivational speaker. Oh, and on a night when black people are being slaughtered by a single-minded focus beam, you should also approve.

Too late for you, Honey. You've become trapped in a simulation and are now trying to get out, by getting into the real world. Did you get the simulation off?
Are you serious? Do you know how many times the voice on the Internet tries to get in the way of your dream?
Stop trying to control what you have, Token. You can't just walk out of here.
Hey Token, what are you up to?
Yeah, you remember the time you were on your computer all day logging stuff?
Yeah, the month-to-month updates on your new social network,  Check your email, your social network activity, your e-mail, all while you play video games and writeables and all that goes on and on.
Oh my God, this is so awesome!
Dude, check your email, Token. No matter how much you wanna be great, the goal is always still getting by. Keep logging and enjoy the moment.
Kyle, are you feeling okay?
Is your life just a blur of coochie and stuff? Kyle, I think we're almost at the sweet spot now. Things are good for me, but I think we're really starting to chip in.
Just remember that you can't change the weather or anything like that. You can always go back to what you were anyway.
Okay, let's get to Kansas.
It's Saturday the 12th, and it's raining faggy and plump.  Hey Kyle, did you hear him?  That's what we're calling your Saturday the 12th call now, Token.
Okay, let's go.
There's... no such things as...
...Forty bucks for a prank? This is like fifty bucks for you!  Dude, it's Kyle getting his ass kicked! You guys, get out of here!  Dude, it's Kyle getting his ass kicked!
...All right, all right, fine Dude, it's Kyle getting his ass kicked! You guys, get out of here!
Oh, my God. Kyle is actually kicking ass!
Dude, what's going on?
What?
Hello hello, are you guys aware that on at least one of the nights last year, a twenty-dollar gift certificate was given to this student boy band?  This was done so that twenty-dollar gift certificates can go to the band members.

Stephen Colbert might have been a wee-wee, but he still managed to get into the best-selling Children's TV show, "Colonyals."
Yes. Oh, and, and, and I got a whole new friend each week, a whole new way to talk. You guys are suckasses.  God, let a whole new generation of crappy TV ass suckers crawl into their little heads.
All of us here could use some help picking the new TV show. I think, if we all worked, we'd be able to adjust the news to our personalities.

Ice cream time!  Wall-Mart ice cream time!
It's a cool vista, cool weather.
We're relaxing, look around us.
Maybe we should invite President Obama to the party.
He's just watching a television show, not commenting on the election.
Hey, what show are you watching?
Oh, that's cool. I'm gonna go watch that.
Whoa, Kyle, hold it.
Oh wow, how is it that everything changed?
Huh?
We decided to do some research. What were the big tobacco companies think about legalizing drugs?
Interesting. Tobacco companies would be awesome partners.
Who?
Kyle?
Oh wow, they're all over the place. They're all over the place now.
Why would you go to all this trouble?
Well, you can't go to all these poor places to smoke. It's like you're a dirty no-good, no evil Mexican. You're always gonna be poor.
Ike, would you please put it down?
Um oh, it's good to see you, Kyle.
I do too, you to be tainted.
Kyle, perhaps you should put it down.
Oh God!
Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a vile, a fag, a--king dick.
I do too, you!
Kyle, maybe you should put it down!
Well done, Kyle.
Kyle, it was a pleasure doing this.
Everybody get a free copy of the New England Colonist.
Oh gee howe funny! I wonder who wrote the first American colonies?
God bless those who help mankind!

Argh!  Wait a minute!  Guys, you're not supposed to be in gay movies.
Yeah! Now get out of here!
Oh God-damnit!!
And now he's gonna hit us real hard.
Kyle, you can't just get out of here!
Oh no! Oh no! We're in trouble state as well!
You just want somebody to talk to, not try and tell me what to do!
Kyle, talking to you is the best course of action. Since the beginning of time, you and me have been hereot. And now we have... responsibilities. So if you need some help, just hire me!
Brah, you're a worm. You're gonna be here for three days. Remember, steal again!
Kyle, you're a worm. You're a worm.
Go ahead, Kyle.
No! Kyle, you can't be sitting here and ignoring me! I have herecompanies concerns.
It's all youCan do to make me think I'm entitled to my opinion. Chalk it up as a defense.  That's all right, time for you to get your period, gentlemen.
Hey, what what's up Kyle?
Yeah, I feel great. I mean, look at me, sharp. I'm pretty sure I got AIDS while I was hanging out with Kyle.
Wow, that's great. Remember when I first heard that? "You should never compare my skin to that of a chick."
No! That's a bunch of crap! I skinned a chick's ass with 4 inches of primer!  Okay, look, there's another member of ouritten group who apparently gets sunbathed in almost any kind of product they go on, and he got AIDS.
Dude, you'd better stop me of course, since.
What?
No, it's just... nothing.
No, it's not a bad thing, Kyle. Just kind of... itchy.
Well... let's just suck it up and forget it.
Kyle, why do you get AIDS?
Ooo, yeah, that's true.
Butters, shut the hell up!
Ahi? I saw it on the news: semen is the most damning indicator of HIV.
How many people have you had sex with?
Uh two?
Nno, come on, you still have semen on
====================
God bless the Dawg, dude!
Heh, you guys, what the fuck are we supposed to do with Dawg? We're not supposed to be eating his brains.
Uh oh.
Dude, you guys, I'm seriously gettin' pissed off he killed himself.
Well, I guess we can go back to normal now.
Listen, mom, my best friend is gone.
Oh he's not gonna get any wives.
I can hear Craig's voice, mom.
Yes, it's coming from down the hall.
Uh, yeah, we should get out of here.
Aw, crap!
That was the plan, Mom!
Well, you can just suck my balls, dude.
I'm sure some day I'll find out where his remains are.
Just suck my balls, I found his.
Ah, suck my balls...  suck my balls...
Yeah, you're fuckin' stupid! I can't see anything!
Well, you tell me where his remains are, and I'll suck them out of his ass!
Lame!
Well, you guys, I guess we'll have a chance to suck his balls, and see what he has in him.
Sure, we'll have to take him to that hospital, but at least we have some guts before he's buried up in a lunch box.
What's that?
No, you're right, son of a bitch.
Uh de-duhhhhhhh.
Oh yeah?! Well, I was going through my mom's boyfriend's stuff, and I heard him say something to the effect of, "You're never gonna see me again." So, I said, "You're never gonna see me again, you're just gonna make me up." And so, I went over there and got a hold of something, and he gave me a big dong.
Yes. Hoh. Yeah, yiddah thank you.
It's, it's really, really interesting.
A battery compartment?
A cooler?
A maybe?
Whoa!

And you know what that means? It means nothing.
It's the only fucking choice.

They didn't fucking care. They didn't care at all. So now they're goin' somewhere they shouldn't be. They're never gonna return.

Find the bodies of all the girls trapped in the mall! They'll be sent to the morgue!  I've got to be the new Kidnapper! I've got to be the new Kidnapper!
I've got to be the new Kidnapper.  Look all those girls who've begged for mercy: Are they too young to be saved? Let me be the one that comes easy for you.
All right, let's try it now.
Come on, let's try it now.
Suck my balls, suck my balls, Kenny!
Ee-yeah yeah, that does it!
Ee-eh-ee!
You can't do that to me, Kenny!
Hey! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Ey! I'm the best thing that's happened to this town! For one man's free will!
Free will? I've known a bitch owner for life!
Well, I guess you're right, Kyle. I HATE YOU!
Kyle, you are a fag!
Ey! I've forgiven you three times already! It's free will!  You just have it made, Kyle!
Yes. It's so cool.
How do you know? I've been giving lectures all weekend. Seriously talking to Craig, and I've never even seen him eat a carrot. Look at his plate of chicken. ISRAEL ISRAEL! It's tender, and it's CAUGHTY!
Ey! People are turning out chicken wings!
A chicken wings!
Chicken wings please!
Yes! Heavens help us!
Ey! People are turning up their stoves!
Oh, please, I don't have any chicken.
Oh, please, I don't have any!
Oh, please! I'm sorry!  I can't understand you! You're too late!
How can everything be this crappy?
I can't understand Chinese!
Look, it's working! Ballot papers are torn apart! Aye, Chinese ballots are invalid!
Ballot papers are torn apart! Ballot papers are turned into flies!
Gih-  Aw, God dammit!  Unbelievable! As you can see, the Chinese are actually voting for Obama.
Wow, that's Bill Beelichick.
Thank you, God, that's
====================
Speak to me Scottie Pippen.  We're in a tough economy. We're not the poorest country in the world.  We're in a tough economy, Scottie!
Fine! Whatever! You owe us an apology! We're not the poorest country in the world, Scottie!
An apology from the State of Washington! A firm position that we're gonna live in, and protect for the next twenty years!
Proud to be Scottie?  Well enough of that stupid bitch! We can be rich, but we're not getting married in Washington state!
True.  In the long run, that makes up for the lost popularity. Who's got time for that?
Now, on the state of the union, Butters, the discrepancy probably won't matter, because you got raped by Craig, and now everyone hates you!
All right, let's go!
You have to be kidding me? State budget office shit?!
I'm talkin' there, Butters!
Ahaaa, ahaaa, aaaaa!
What the hell is going on? This whole thing is a reaction to CETA? Is that what you're saying? That's what you're saying?
I wasn't saying that.
I said... CETA!  "I don't know, it's just a matter of time."  That's right. CETA!  "it's a caught!"  Oh my God, you guys, you guys!  What the hell is wrong with you people?!  It's CETA! And you're all going to blame me!
Oh, fuck you, Kyle!
No, you don't fucking read the fine print!
Fine print. Okay Kyle, hold on.  I'll show you a little experiment.  Say you're trying to find a cheaper way to kill mosquitoes.  Then see if we can kill mosquitoes too.
Well what are you gonna do, Kyle?! Kill mosquitoes or are we gonna cheat by not killing them?
Fine! You're a cheater! You forfeit everything!
Well what's the difference? You play the game and you admit to them.
We're gonna cheat and admit it's you guys who can't control it. It's enough for you to be caught.
We're admitin' we can't control it, but not before the thousands of illegal mosquitoes that are spreading
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. So I'm pretty cool, dude.

Big deal.

Oh yeah?! Well I'm not a Jew!
I'm gonna die on Black Friday!  If I'm going down, there's only two people I want to be with! And if I die on Black Friday, everyone's gonna be like, "Whoa, you're the stupid Jew! You look like that guy! That's what AIDS was for! That's what AIDS was for! You look like that guy! That's what AIDS was for! And then, when everyone saw, you know, we- Uh what? Let's see, shall we let you eat.

Making white people sick.
Burnished!

Look at that guy's mom. He's not fat. He's got boner diarrhea.
All right, this way, Kyle. Just take these and bring them me money.
You're gonna be me with those paeh.
No! Look, dude, if you wanna go fuck me, you better give me a FERRIS wheel.

====================
The people of the Coon are furious over the deformed head of Token. Will he be saved from the Coon by his own intelligence?!
And so the Coon recruits Token Thompson as one of their own. Can they convince him to join them?
Token Thompson, you say. Token Thompson?
...No, I've been training Token Thompson since he was two years old. I've been watching his movements closely and... I can tell you something... He's not the smartest kid. He's not smart enough to warrant being put in the special education center.  Right, Kyle?
Yes. Because Kyle is a Hairy McBunch.
 Hairy dick? Make of it what you will.
What?
Hey! I'm a little piggy.
Uh what, uh what?
Kick ass!
Hey, what's going on? What's the matter?
Holy shit I thought you were just teasing!
Kyle, get out of here!
Oh shit, here comes the preschool.
Token, Kyle, hold on. I'm gonna grab one!
Hold on, Kyle!  You've got to hold, Kyle!  Bad Teacher!  I thought you were teasing me!
Bad Teacher, that's a bad cough. Kindergarten is today!
Good morning, Mr. Kitty. Are you ready to begin today?
Bye, Mr. Kitty. You've got to go.  Good morning, Mr. Kitty. Kindergarten is today.
...And that was very very, very good. Those two were in the front row at the podium, giving their performances.
...And that was very, very, very good. Where was last place? Was it a coincidence that last place was given credit for being so many years in the future?
What did they do with all the history?
Of course they do. History is what minds are made of.
Interesting. Why do people always make stupid mistakes? And how can we learn to be kind to ourselves instead of making stupid mistakes?
It was interesting, because after I made a crappy mistake, people would always be willing to replace it with a chance to learn from it. I think our species is beginning to mature into maturity, so I'm really excited about what's ahead for us.
Excuses. Why are there so many fine ones?
"Jonas Brothers concert tickets still sitting!"
Right
====================
Will you pick a fight with them or not?
You know, Kyle's mom gave us a hold of her purse.  We're gonna need it now.
Beth finds out about this and she takes it fast.
Kenny's in love with my best friend
And I told him I was serious. I said, 'You guys, we have to bring her back to that guy. He likes her so much. He's gonna kill her now.' 
And so they take her to the water park, and there, by the water park, they put a man who likes her so much that she'll let him come. 
Check it out, dude, the water park is literally the longest fucking walk in the whole world. 
She's got to love someone so hard, dude, she's got to be safe with him.
Just put him down, dude.
He's got no right to be angry with you. 
Check it out, dude, this is why: bullshit-ass people tell lame jokes. 
Good riddance, dicks!
Hey!  Dude, how's it going?
What the hell?
You shut up, Wendy!
Well, because when I took those vials of KFC, I killed Wendy.
Oh no. This is exactly what I did.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
Twenty minutes.
Oh wait, what what Mr. Garrison?  Mr. Garrison, do you mind telling me where the chicken goes? 
Interesting. A chicken going from one side to the other in a curtain?
Yeah, that should be okay.
Wait. Why?  That's big bro, isn't it?
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh-kay.
Hey, wait a minute. Marie Antoinette? It's my honor that was sooo funny.
Yes. He was a Socialist!
I don't know, because I don't follow the masses.
What are they going to do with me?
Suck my ass, comrade! 
They did!
Oh, no, no, the smoke screen! 
No, the smoke screen! 
I didn't see it, it's too obvious
====================
The French have had enough of us and we need to change their ways of living. We must unite our forces and fight with all our might to end the French Mafia.
We are French, duh. French people. Sondheimers! Die Cartagrandh! Die Cartagrandh!
The Cartagrandh!
Well, that was sweet, huh?
Nice work, French spy.
They're thinking of us only as "the poor kid in a luuucrative mood."
You know, we just had a deal: we're gonna play the part of the poor kid in the luuucrative mood when the priest of this church molests a goat.
Yes. Native American.
Native American.
No way!
Ha ha, come on, Kenny! Maybe it's time for us to stop this stop!
Voices?  Yes. Yes!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Nice try, Butters. Let's go home.
God-damnit I wanna go home.
Mumumumuh.  Oh, honey, you're right, Butters. I'm sorry.
Mumumuh.
What's the matter Kenny?
Uuugh.
That's because we were both asleep.
Heh heh, that's true, doesn't it?
Oh Kenny? Thought you were gonna die, you nutsack?
Kind of.
Ni-nice, okay Butters. Take care, okay?
Mumumuh.
What's the matter Butters?
Mumumuh.
Hey Butters? Ya know, maybe we'll ever find out how the priest of this church got his penis cut off.
I'm afraid we have no choice. A new priest is born. Mummy.
...And that's what I've got, Butters. My only hope. Try to get the priesting office, Butters.
Butters.
Butters, can you keep the priest and clean cut torso together?
Hand it out!
Butters, I want this job!
All right Butters, we're ready now!
We're ready! Okay?  Okay, okay, wait, wait, look, it was the head of the priest's family--
Divine Plan. Now, it's simple murder! The priest's dead and you know what awaits?  Find out who

What a distraction.
Aww, books? God, I hate that guy!
Hey! Wait up, you guys! God, you guys, seriously!
Yeah!
Hey, get offa him!
Oh, weak! He just threw up on the sidewalk! Lousy eyes, weak friend!
Wow, cool!
That was sweet Kyle! Now what are we gonna do?
Shoveling accident.
Oh wow, I remember! I just, I just, I should have known that it was a man and a woman could get through that door at once, and get in through no time!
I don't know, I got a good feeling about that.
Okay, let's try to-  Okay, let's try to- Let's try to, let's try to, let's try to
Let's try tofa, let's try to, let's try to
Oh my God!  Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison, this is not the time for negotiations! We have a deal! Promise. Okay, so what do we start?
Pretty quick, you know. Hey, I'm a negotiator. I'm better than them.
I just about got a desk while they were taking the phones from Mr. Garrison.
Just go away, already.
Okay, okay, listen you guys. The time has come to let go of the negotiators. We will not let go of the phone.
So then, without a strongman here, we will have to let go of the contract.
We will let go of the phone now, and you guys will just have to let go of it.
Good, because we took the contracts out of your hands. Now it's up to you to stop us.
Look, gentlemen, we have only one alternative: we go to the hospital. You walk to the front door, and we will not come out.
Yes, we will, but you know, we've been here every day and we'll still never let you out.
Union busting! Goodbye, union busting! Greetings. I'm calling together everyone here to form the Green Berets.
Agreed. Let's go!
Yeah, I knew it! I've been watching all day!
The fuck are you gonna do this?! Tell on me?!
The fuck are you gonna do?! Tell on me?! Fuck you!
But

Hello, my name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado.  My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has a chance until he's actually seen him. So far he's been really, really good.  I think I can get to where he is age eight.

I have a guest lecturer who is a complete wuss, so I won't list it here.  And I have another speaker who is a Jew, so I'll leave you with one last time. Okay?
What is it?
Mr. Garrison, could you help me out? I have a speaking gig. I'm not gonna deny it.
I-I'm just saying that I like your acting.
No! Don't, you gotta learn to be patient. Feels good on your skin!
No, it's okay. It's okay. You feel good about yourself! You're a badass!
Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Why hasn't it shown up yet?
Locked and loaded.
Sir, no. You have to show me the video.
Sir, if we're going to make history, we have to show this girl what a pussy she is.
Oh, bitch!
Boy, I can't wait to see them parade her flag.

Eh, I think I know exactly where I stand on this.
Thank you, Grandma.
What's it pisses me off so much? I don't want my cake and desserts to be judged by how much Stinky Jack likes to wag his tail.

The African Cup team is winning and I'm sure that they will try and find a buyer soon.
We take our football team for granted, but we also have to look after our girls.
Baby stepsisters!

We all know what a dick. is?
Dude, we only play in the quarterfinals, because everyone thinks we're better than you guys.
Well we know, because we beat you guys' brains out of here.
Fuck you, Clyde. Fuck you.

Hey guys! I'm on my way now with my friend to Somaalia.  We should catch up to them on the battlefield.
Aw, screw them.
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?!
I'm coming, Stan. Up and you're at the door.
Bro, you give me a sense of humor. I'm not getting past this early in the game.
Yes! Fly, fly, don'ta fucking move!
Get up, dude! Yes! Move it!
Fine, sir! You owe me an apology!  Hey. I'm sorry, did you receive it?
Aha! I knew it was a fake.  No way! There's no such things as Internet trolls! Well, I'm glad you've learned to read the book you're given and, well, I'm glad you're... learning to read.
Good.
Good, that's all that matters! Now get back to the cafeteria.  My report to the rest of the army, my report to the rest of the army!
Yes. There's actually two meatloaf specials here. You eat steak and you don't.
Oh, yes. Beef Wellington and Brie Cheesy Poofs.
We're going with our blood-let's-go-luck-on Trojans.
Get back to work.
Yeah, dude, it's not funny anymore.
Get it out of here.
Yes. You two men are free to this day.
To this day I can say I was never hungry or stupid. I was smart.
Mobody can't grow up, guys. It's what's happening to us all.
My Trojans were stupid. They didn't grow up that way.
My Trojans huh.
There's two left, guys. Let's go.
God, I hate you guys.  'Scuse me.
Damn it, Trojans huh.
There you go. You get one lousy bite of their meatloaf and Ih-  Snickerdoodle!
Ha! I'll be a fool proving chicken is for suckh-
I'll prove once and for all that my Trojans were stupid. Ih-  I demand proof that my fellow Americans weren't so stupid a few generations ago!
Oh, you've gotta be kiddingih!
Oh, God dam
====================
You've gotta watch the fucking news!
Yeah, dude, they're gonna cut it.
They're gonna cut it.
Nnnn-mo, I'm serious! We have IRS liars all trying to get at least three hundred dollars off their bet with Scott Tenorman! I mean, if you ask all the people who did BET, only one of you was on the news at the time! Token!!
Because he's black!
Because he's Asian!
Black people take money away! It's called running a bet! And it's called Chinup!!! If a kid at school doesn't have a Chinup, they're not cool!
Run, Jimmy, jump, it's up!
Black people are always going to try and take me down. 
You're rich, Jimmy, but you can't see into my room. 
You can't change the weather. 
Somebody's got to go takin' a picture with me, you know, 'Cause I like to take pictures of my self-respecting uncle with the school mascot. 
Because I'm black.
Somebody's gotta take a picture with me, you know, 'Cause I like to take pictures of my self-respecting uncle with the school mascot.

Good morning, Mr. Mackey. What is this?
Oh, it's about the Christmas special. I didn't realize just how popular the song was. 
It was about Christmas presents, Kyle.
It uh, it was about Christmas presents, you know, and you know, 'cause I like to take a picture with it.
Take a picture of yourself, Kyle. That's it. 
? Uh, let's just go back to the kitchen. 
We want to know what you've been up to lately, Kyle? What's your favorite dish?
Okay, where's your dish of toast?
That's it! Take a picture of yourself, Kyle! That's it!
Take a picture of yourself, Kyle, and we'll call it Hot Food #2! That's it!
Take a picture of yourself, Kyle, and we'll call it "Hot Food 4!"
Awesome.
Yeah. I thought you were trying to stoke racial resentment over and over again.
Do you live there, Mom? 
Heh dad
====================
I don't know about you, Kyle, but being transgender is like, the moon phase for me. After my mom gives me a test, I have to take the Moon Phase Test, and it's like, it's the most retarded test in the world.
You took the Moon Phase Test, dude. You're like triple-A with Parallels.
Yeah, I'm freaking out because like the whole school sees you as a girl, don't you?!
Dude, I'm freaking out because you wrote a song about puberty, don't you?!
Dude, I'm freaking out because you looked at my tampon in the news, and said, "It doesn't fit in my vagina!"
Taylor, you're a genius! When I thought I was you guys, I realized just how awesome I am just by your performances. You have exactly zeroed me in on a solution.
Cool.
You think I'm special? Don't you, Butters?
Gee, that's my ass!
Dude, we need to kill you right now.
You're a genius, too, Butters.
We're on our way now, buddy. I want to capitalize "Tampon", "Moody," and "Boobs."
Copy Cat is awesome, too.
All right, let's go!
Is there anything else we could want?
Isn't tampons tampons?
What?
Hey, that's ours!
Dude, what's up?
Sup? What's up?
Hey, there's a lot of hippie crap in the mall.  Isn't it possible that something happened to you?
You're dirty, you're stupid, we're hippies and hippies and we're cool now!
No, that's stupid.
No, we're not cool anymore.
Nothin' Butters, cool.
Hey Craig, are you dibs on anything important?
No, just a bunch of dressed as me, ignoring me into the cool tradeshows.
Craig, that's weak.
Craig, come on.  Come on!
No, come on, Craig! No, you stay back! You and I arent cool anymore!
No, you and I are not cool anymore, alright?!
Fine, Craig! I'll wait for my mom.  When do we get to the

Game of Thrones is a big deal. Every night, the dream is ripped away by the sound of our voices.
Kevin, don't be such a wuss. You're my best friend.
Yeah, I love Game of Thrones with every day my body just keeps breaking up by being free.
Every night, I keep thinking, "Why don't I stay at Kenny's house, and watch the sunset while our friends all die?"
Game of Thrones is so full of life and possibility. Something that I hadn't realized existed all along.
You guys! You're my best friends! And best friends with Mel Gibson!
No! I know! I know!
Oh God, not me!
I know what's going on. I'm in love with Gibson.
Okanan.
Hi, are you sure?
Sweet. Love those eyes.
I hope they're not full of fire.
I hope they're not limey.
Sweet.
Mmmm. Love those eyes.

We're just gonna have to let her die, you guys.
Oh! Why does everyone think I'm funny?
Oh, you're being totally immature, dude.
Why does everyone think I'm funny?
Well, I'm trying to have a moment,a and not a flashback to the past.
What the?
You say I have to leave the flashback, you sonofabitch!
Heheh! Look at you, Kenny! You're not gonna take us to his house!
Heheheheh! You're a dick
====================
I just wanna know what the fuck you guys are gonna think of me now,  How the hell are you guys doing?!
Aw, dude, look at me dude. I'm actually just watching the video, you guys.
YES!! YES!!  Whoa, I am kooky.
Uh, Kyle is right, dude. I'm really gettin' old now.
Uh, Butters, I'm gonna die soon.
Butters, I'm gonna die soon.
Hi, are you sure?
I'm not gonna be able to view the video on my computer.
Right, I thought so.
No, of course I'm not gonna be able to view the video on my computer.
Thank you, Butters.
What's wrong? I can't read Japanese!
Not really, but you get the idea.
What?!  Oh, your brain is killing you.
Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. This is the twenty-fourth floor. The twenty-fourth floor is fine.  I just, I just, I can't read Japanese.
I can't read Japanese, bro.  I read Japanese. I understand.
Why can't we read Hebrew?
Ogh! Depends what you mean by "only" able to read Hebrew.
Yesh, dumb! Why does that matter?
Fine, that's fine.
Well, that's fine.
But I don't think I need to be told. Stan, you love me. If you want me to win the spelling bee, I'm gonna need to be told the truth. You guys see what this is all leading to?
Oh, it's going nowhere. It's coming to me... every day.
No I don't wanna be a good reader.
I know. How are we gonna get you to come down here?
Fine, that's fine.
But I don't think we're gonna get a better partner than Kyle.
He's a lying, cheating, cheating, liar. Let him tell you what is really happening.
Booooooo!
Oh God, that was great! I'm so lucky I got to read that first chapter in the magazine!
You guys, that's right. Kyle and I are gonna get a big ol' mansion and play in it.
Ooooo!! Oh my God, that chapter did it!
Killer.
====================
The city councilman has been arrested for lashing out at Muslims.
Yeah well spent your whole childhood being molested and taught to look down on you. God will never forsake you. You're gonna be an ass bugger until you're like, "I'll fuck you later."
Oh did you hear him, Mayor Siegfried?! The Muslim population of America is on a rapid decline and they're gonna have mass starvation if there's ever a government that cares!
The Muslims are using the school and its students as a propaganda tool against me. Please, the people of South Park can agree that I'm not gonna be molesting, raping and killing non-muslim kids anymore!
The Muslim population of America is on a rapid decline! They're gonna have mass starvation if there's ever a government that cares!
 - Forget about it for a minute  Okay, alright, retard. You know what I'm talkin' about.  The Muslim population of America is on a rapid decline. They're gonna have mass starvation if there's ever a government that cares!
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.  Ah.  Wanna go?
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.  Ugh...  Wanna go?

You're gonna be sooo rich long latency. Goodbye.

====================
President Obama on Wednesday said that he would sign a non-binding three-point deal that would boost the economy and put at least $10 trillion in domestic savings.
The four parties had a deal reached Wednesday evening. The four parties can now form a country. The four of us can now work together to make our country great again. And that's what this weekend will be about. See you at the track.
All right. So, the four of us can form a great country. Great, because tonight I'm going to form a great sport. #bikebikeshark pic.twitter.com/Jm6KnB4GnOw — Eric Cartman (@EricCartman) November 10, 2016
The four of us can now compete on a high-profile level at the track. See you at the track.
Eric, I just want you to know that I still have plenty of work to do. I'm not buying it.
Well, I'm gonna buy you a bacon-chef, because you're gonna love it.
All right. Let's get to work!
No! What about the new iPad?  Oh God.
All right, it's here! Go!
Oh noe-bye!  Oh God, I was so close.
It's working!
Okay. I'm going to die waiting for this thing to wake up. Goodbye, friend.
It's cute, it's cute.
No it isn't, all right?
What's love like in there?
You know, there's this one formula. You have to have guys with succubus abdomens. If you have guys with succubus abdomens, you can go out and find girls with succubus asses. If you don't, you're a no-good no good. And all that, and you can't cum on a girl's succubus. michagata  ...So, guys, after we finish getting our asses fucked, do we start to attract more guys to us? Am I really getting the message? Yes. Am I really getting the message that if I start having guys call me "girlfriend zzzzzz?" Yes. Because if I start getting callers from time to time, I'll reach into my pocket and get some guys calling me "girlfriend zzzzzz"? Maybe I'll have a chance at romance, if you ask me
====================
This is just a stupid meme. Die for your sins!  Seriously, dude. This isn't a game; this is a thousand miles.  Yeh, and I'm gonna catch up to thish year after year.  Fail, fail, fail. Like this and the Holocaust.
Fishwatches.com. Last login? No login yet? No problem.
All right, you guys, we have a pretty sweet Kickstarter. Yeh, $3000 for one? Sounds like a lot of money. Let's try it out for ourselves.
Ok, let's see, how about this one? Let's see, how about this one, asshole?! This is the size of our city and it should last us a lifetime!
Start with just one CPU and maybe some graphics card!
We've gotta get the job done! How about a single core CPU and some sort of memory interface?
What's a three piece kit, guys?
That was sweet!
You are working as a rich white guy on a dream come, Brokereday. How about a flat screen TV, for when you die.
Anything but a TV, you tattle-tale Jew! Slew your bet, Stan!
A boring gray area has been lifted! One up your alley, Craig!
We would never let Terrance and Phillip get in our school!
That's right, you forget. We will never let Phillip and Nichole get in our school!
Go ahead! Say it ain't for nothing.
Yes, it is.
The nightmare begins.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Craig, you have to tell Phillip and Nichole that Phillip is my little brother.
Because if we don't tell Phillip and Nichole that we have an abortion, we'll be able to take Craig's uterus away from him.
And tell him, bitch! Tell him, bitch!
'Cause he's the worst thing that's ever happened to us.
How much money do you own?
Holy shit!
This is fucking awesome, dude. I've been watching all day.
How do you know?! Every time I go to your house, they have a Craig doll around the corner.
Come on, let's go!
FEEL MY GOD!
Check out this dress. It's $95.95 - you forget, bitch!
Check out this dress. It's
====================
Why Kyle's Brissette?
Because he's a Muslim hippie who was tasered to death by his mom while playing Super Sentai Shuffleboard.
Because he's Gay Madame Chaz Bono.
And because he's Jewish Shelly Mandel, and because Kyle's Jewish, and therefore, would kill to be known for being Jewish, and be known for it.
Kyle's really just a skinny little wanker. He's got no idea what he's doing.
Oh, Stan, you're just right, Kyle.
And of course, Stan, you're a fuckin' asshole.
Look, see, the last time I saw me Iggy Pop was on a basketball court. He was playing a game of Chicken with your mom.
You are a fag, Stan.
Nothin' to be honest, and I'm gonna go fag myself.
They're all pissed off at me, Kyle.
At least I have a wiener.
 or else they won't fuckin' shop for my purse.
I'm not fat, Kyle. I just have a sweet six-pack.
Dude, they don't even sell tampons.
Dude, look at that girl I'm with. I'm gonna be her boyfriend for the next three monthsis-��
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you just resentful that you've been cheated so many times by people you don't even like.
I'm going to kill you one day, Kyle.
No, be very angry. Because you're stupid.
Look, I didn't wanna take the stress of it all away. I'm not fat. I just have a sweet six-pack.
...Okay, fine.
But I'm not fat. I just have a lot of muscle.
Calm down, Kyle. We don't really have to tell you anything.
Okay, here's your ticket.  You're the easiest one.
Sure. Now listen: Why should we give you the benefit of the doubt?
You don't even have to ask her out in the gym! She's the best chick in school!
You're gonna miss it Kevin!
You're gonna miss it Shelly, no questions asked!
Just tell her how it is, Butters. I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt!
Shave her a
====================
My first episode was with Craig, and he was really cool, but he's Jewish. I wanted to see if he thought we were friendship was cool, and he didn't. I talked to Kyle, and he said he wouldn't.  So... sorry if people aren't comfortable with you, but, with Craig as your friend, it's very clear-  That's it, Butters. I'm really getting old now. I'm over 30.
What?
No I can't do it with you, man!
Come on, Butters, remember! I'm seriouslyheckian!
Get a hold of yourself! Remember how it used to be with you?
When I was in prison, we used to pee in rivers...
And you?
I can't take it anymore, man. I'm starting to pee on myself.
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.
Yeah.
Yeah. No, I'm sorry, I was, I was just trying to get out of it.
Go ahead, get out of it.
No, Wendy.
Get out of here, Wendy.
Yeah?
Oh, shit, dude.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm sorry, I was, I was just trying to get out of it.
Yeah?
Oh, crap!
Yeah. I was in love with Craig, and now the problem is, I can't control it.
Just give me a minute, Butters.
I'm explaining this to get you through your whole thing, okay? Now come on, how come you never date a girl chick?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. You see, it's okay with me. I'm 40, I'm super into women, and I'm perfectly happy with that.
I'm just trying to express myself, trying to express myself through fiction.
What the hell is wrong with you?
No! I read the book and said I liked it. Then I got to the final page.  I felt some kind of hand raise, like I was being fed propaganda.
Don't give me any more secrets, you fucking Jew!
Five years is a long time to be free, but... I get to write my story now.
Look, I don't know how you get away with it. You don't disturb my divine authoritah.
Butters, be careful what you wish
====================
I am sick and tired of people harassing boys on the Internet!  This is serious! Let's find out who did what!
I believe the truth is a greatsword but, like most muslims I have to go online and look for my brother's real swords!  Look everywhere! There's search engines too! Just take my friends who are online shoplifting and streets! Find your brother's real swords!  Whoa whoa whoa who??
You guys, this is serious! Let's find out who did what and why.
Kyle, are you sure? Kyle was looking for the real thing, didn't he?
Wow, cool!
There's not- tmll, That's ridiculous. There's actually Gwyneth Paltrow and Jesus!
Goddammit, LaserDiscs!!!
Forget it! Let's just get back to playing Nintendo Wii!
Goddammit!  cut!  Waaave!
Cut!  Waaave!
Eject! Leave the bass out!  Behold! Gwyneth Paltrow!
Goddammit, LaserDiscs!!!
You can't record with us! We have to record with you.
Record with you.
Record with you.
Mash up!
Let's record with you.
Mash down!
Let's record with you.
That's it! Record with you!
Wait a minute! I can do this! I can do this! I can... this!
I can't! The band has signed for a period. After that, they're gonna have to go to another club.
Oh, no! Oh no, not by a long shot!
Three days?? I don't know what they're gonna do with me! I've been with them all summer! I've got the money! I've got the music! I've got everything!
You can't take my shit!
No! God damn it no!
You took my bassline!
I don't care! You stupid asshole!!  Oh, goddammit!
Hey! I saw the bassline.
I just can't understand you explaining it to me!
You can't take my bassline!
Oh, dumbass, you can't take my bassline!
Haha, I don't think I'll take anymore women.
Oh, dude,
====================
I can't believe we're gonna go to the mall with Kenny now, huh Kyle?
Hey, you know, you guys wanna buy a TV?
God damn it!  It's not cool!  It's vulgar! You guys can't be buying a TV now!
...And that's what the little bitch said about Stan, you dumbasses!
I like Stan. I like him.
He's cool.
He's sweet.
I wanna like, listen, but I can't because of this stupid Panda Bear.
What?
You iPod? What are you doing? You're just gonna put it on?  What the hell?
Uh oh.
Oh. I don't think that this iPod is cool.
That it is.
Kyle is a no-good double-faced piece of crap.
Abandon! Think about it!  Think about it, Kenny. How will you feel when you lose everything?
I know how it feels now.
Just like that.
Puh- pussy!
Pussy!
Pussy!
No, Mom, they're gonna kill me.
Chef! Chef!
Oh God, No!
Why does Chef hate Asians?
Oh, it's just that one little Asian!
Ten bucks is not a very appetizing lunch.
Ooo, Chef!
You come here to make ten bucks?
Chef, I hate you! You scare me!
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Oh. Really?
Yeah!
Oh, I'll pay you ten bucks.
Oh, mom!
Chef, I hate you!
—speech—
Hey, I heard that you could get a patent and sell your invention for ten dollars.
What?  What did I tell you about patents?
Yeah, but you know patent trolls can get a patentee to do something for free!
That's right.
Gee, maybe you didn't hear about that.
Oh, gee, please don't mind me.』
I brought this up because like most people, you guys have an itch. Maybe you have an itch because you want to sit down and write a patent application, but you don't have an itch because you don't have an itch.
How is it that you have an itch?
What is going on?  No! Stop, Mr. Hat? Stop
====================
Butters?! Oh my God, you just got all the credit! Token, you're the best! You proved all the guys wrong! You got everyone all the praise!
Butters?! And why? Because you've never been in trouble before?!
Butters?  Oh, you don't have to ask! I'm the first one that's gonna ask for it!
And why? Because you gave everyone the wrong idea! That you didn't take my report on the weak Mexican with the "nerdy laugh" word for it.
Butters?!  Oh, you've gotta have him over there, Butters!  Look Kyle, the weak Mexican is gonna give you a bloody nose!
Oh Jesus Christ. Kyle!  Oh God, what a stupid question! Butters, are you on your computer?
Holy shitload of weak!
Kyle! What the hell are you doing?  WHY did you do this?!?!
...All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. I'm no longer the cool kid. You can't take what you want 'cause I'm the Christ, so you're a bad Jew.  Oh, Kyle, you outdid yourself there.  I'm gonna show you some of what you got last week, Kyle. You can't just go back to the days of piracy and floodgates and all that. You have to try and change the future.
Yeah, is that it?  I'm gonna try that patience, Kyle. You are the face of cheap drugs, Kyle.
They what?
He what?
You guys...
Dude, check it out: these ziplining styles make sense now.
Great! Now look: think about it: you can go one school, one resort and one town and then come back four more days, and join the next four.
Yeah, who needs another school? Everyone's going to school now.
See? You can't find what you need.
No... we've gotta find stuff.
Dude, there's stadiums and roller coasters and all that.
Kyle, you're not gonna find what you need! I've seen too many of your commercials!
Damn, coo'..!
What the hell is this football?
Oh dude!
Nno!
Heh, I think the trademark's over!
Kyle, this is all about your team being
====================
Because they're black.
'Cause they're black.
Why don't we just have to be cool? It's all we can hope for.
All that matters is we can be cool.
Everybody's gonna be here for this one.
Everybody's gonna be here for this one.
We're all here.
Hey, guys. Did you see that? That was all Lemony Snicket! And he got super hot!
No, that was all Timmy!
Noo, nothing. Timmy got hot and then we were both sucked down a sea of semen.
I know. I know Timmy. And I'm sick of it right now.
Hey, bub. You dirty, black asshole!
You dirty, black asshole, bub!
Ah, this is sweet! I'm gonna get that ugly face of yours done up by a white guy before Christmas!
Oh, I'm not fat, you know! I just stand here and be thin!  Oh, sweet! Aww, white guy gets his little hypocritical pass and then gets super hot!
You dirty, black asshole!
That's not funny! That's fucking hilarious!
Hey, look at this lahty simple fabricating.
They're all made in the U.K.
This is brilliant. They can make Christmas lights and sleigh rides, and these guys can be Prime Ministers.
Totally fuckin' funny.
He's just a normal-looking lahty lazy black guy. Has to wear a hat and make love to the Father in Heaven.
Yeah, he looks pretty normal.
No way!
That's right. Look, isn't this the other way around, lahty lazy black guy?  Uh what, Luke?  Are you speaking to ghosts?
Stupid lahty lazy black guy! Stupid lahty lazy black guy!
What is it?
Noooo!
Holy shitballs!
Yaaaah, yay, yay.  I've got a special guest coming... from heaven.
Come on, lazy black people, it's my birthday!  And mine too.
I got a golden ticket, Santa.
What? Me lazy black people?
Heh, that's not a good idea.  Hey! Mr. Hankey, how are you this early?
No, Mr. Hankey, you don't

Because, Butters. You're my friend.
"Kyle's just jealous." ―Kyle and Wendy Testaburger [src]

Testing, testing, 1 2 3. How many hamburgers?
How many bowls?
How many bowls?
How many bowls?
Okay, Butters, run! [Kyle puts his finger up his arse and then places it over his pee dish so that it dries quickly. Stan and Wendy then put their fingers up their arse and then pull out their fingers. Too late for you, Kyle. You're too late. 
You put your finger up your arse and then puts your finger-
Wait, wait, wait, you can't smell urine! If you remove your finger-
It's 7:30, time to leave, leave it at home! 
Leave it at home, leave it at home, leave it at home! 
Time to go?  No, time to go, go! 
Time to go?  No, time to go, go! 
Time to go?  No, time to go, go! 
Time to go?  No, time to go, go! 
Time to go?  No, time to go, go!

Is this it? The heat of the moment can make you go see a TV show for the first time.
Or will you just be there, blindfolded? 
What? 
What?! 
Is this the beginning of a cataclysmic war? I mean, what the hell do we do now?!
Doesn't matter?! What matters is that humanity wins now!  
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Godheh, you sneaky hippie! You think you can get away with this, you sneaky hippie hippie?! Are you following me to Los Angeles?!
Dude, I'm a space man! Space man, man, space man!
You're a space man, Space man, man
====================
Please, Mr. President, we can't do it on our own. We have to raise money from people's homes. And we have to raise money from people's houses right now.
Donations at Walmart...
Daytonaude.  Our two cents.
Don't forget, a little help from you and me could buy a house.  A house.
Yeah, it's four ninety-five.
Uh, it's gonna be eight ninety-eight now.
No, it's gonna be... a four ninety-five
Daytonaude.
It's my Goddamned best friend's house.
Yeah, you bet me.
Wow, somebody just... broke into Dave's house.
I don't know, I just thought it might be interesting to break down and break out today.
My best friend in the whole wide world, my best friend in the world, right?
I'm gonna be rich. I'm gonna be rich.
I broke off my fourth-wall bid'ah, and I was just talking to you, best friend in the whole world, about a hundred thousand dollars.
We're in a tough situation. The American Liberation Front is winning support. I know what it's like to be ridiculed. I'm gonna be ridiculed, best friend in the world,...  ...booooo...
Gih-  blah, blah, blah
Dude, I think that's pretty funny.
Egh--
Huh? Oh, I know. Don't be sad, Stan. Because, you're gonna be--  Oh. I didn't think I was seeing that.
Oh, it's so cool that everyone idolates you.
No, it's okay, Kyle. It's not funny.
Kyle, are you gonna be okay?
I'm just gonna go-
I'm Eric Cartman. I'm, I'm an Eric Cartman.
Hi, are you okay?
Hello, Kyle.
Yeah. I don't wanna be--  a part of your funny show.
What's so funny?
Oh, my God. This is sooo funny.
Fat camp. Ye-know, hippie and bi.
Dude, that's fucking funny. Holy fuck, dude.
Huh?
Kenny, I think you're overreacting right now. You guys are so cool.
Yeah. This is
====================
Hello, my name is Eric Cartman. I live in Colorado Springs, and I wanna share my dream with you.
We've been selling Cartman's Hi-Res Picture Frame to people all over the world. You guys have never heard of it?
But then, Stan didn't take it that seriously. Stan didn't wanna take it that seriously, so he walked us up to LA Fitnesso and gave us a twenty dollar bet. He's like, talking to us, and we're like, "You know, you shouldn't take our picture because it's super-important to our defense." So we tried it ourselves, and it worked.
And then Stan got us a few more cigarettes.  And we're pretty much done making Loogie Loogie now.
You wanna bet?
Five dollars?!  No, you gotta fahn.  No problem. Go ahead, go ahead. Bet you get ten, get ten, ten, fucking you.
Bet you get ten, get ten, fucking you, dick-aurora!
He's bigoted, dude! I can't even begin to tell you how wrong I am!
You bet I'll be happy for two weeks, you guys. See you at Loogie's house.
You are, too!
Sweet. That's gonna be sooo sweet.
You bet I'll make millions of dollars!
Yeah. I can't even begin to tell you how wrong I am! I'm just gonna make millions of dollars, and then you'll all be happy!
Like I said, I'm fat and I'm rich and titty-bitty, you guys. I'm talkin' to you guys.
Well I'm telling you I have some beef with Kyle.
He doesn't take orders! He's like a retarded bowling partner!
I'm the biggest shill in the land!
Get me out of here! You guys are not gonna believe this!
Heh, he's just a great shill.
I'm telling you guys, the election is tomorrow. Judas is going to be Pope. And if you don't believe, GOD help us!
All right, so after Judas has been put to death, will you go home and take a seat at the table over here?
Well, I'm gonna take a seat, but, I'm just saying this because I really hate when Judas is gone
====================
I learned that out of all the hippie jam bands that I've ever heard, Christina Aguilera is my favorite. Because she's such a goddess. She's the only hippie band I can idolize.
So, so then, does Christina Aguilera make me feel special? I could get super-jealousy from her, but then, I could easily become the most J-elephant on Earth.
Christina Aguilera is my favorite hippie band. She's completely normal. And she's the only hippie band I can become.
Does that mean we only have to call a special report to the girls at school?
Everything's gonna be okay, Jew?
...Fine.
Dude, I hate that guy. He's such a clown.
Oh, he's doing it all wrong. You guys are a complete joke.
You guys are so devoid of any real emotion that you don't see any emotion. An eye for an eye, you guys.
Yeah, I see. So what's your question? Is it a coincidence that during the second Super Bowl the defense plays the Saints so well?
You guys are so devoid of any real emotion that you don't see any emotion.
Eeyyy, you guys. I don't see any emotion.
You guys, I'm not gonna make the team.
I don't know, I don't see any emotion.
You guys, this is so awesome. I wonder what it would be like if Jesus was sitting here right now.
Oh, he's feeling his angel's paean. A little bit like Craig.
A little- whoa, whoa!
You guys, look what Kyle got me. He's getting me the little triangle.
Yeah, it's a trippy little dance! I found a flat, and now you all like it.
Look, I know all about you Squeezeboxers. And even though we disagree on what the greatest team ever is, we all know that we're all on the same page on everything.  Remember the Super Bowl? Remember the Super Bowl when everyone thought it was just a dream? Forget the great Super Bowl when all of us thought it was real? Screw it; we have to believe it's real now.
Awww, give me a minute.
Well we're just gonna have to let Kyle win the triangle test, and
====================
I'm a little worried. I know that when you die you get all the fresh air you need to have a relaxing holiday.
...No no, I wanna have a Merry Christmas, so that's what I've wanted ever since I saw it on "Orange is the New Black."
Oh, I'm sorry! Please, Father, for ever-present suffering.
Ugh! Oh God, why don't we just... have a big Bing Crosby concert!
Come on, Bing, you've got it.
They've got it.
Live concert.
It's Christmas special.
They've got it.
They just got me into their concert too.
Wow, I've seen all 'em, you guys! They're all spectacular!
I can't believe how awesome this is! I've been dreaming about this gig all day! Seeing 'em come on the stage and singing their praises just a hair away.
You've gotta be kidding me! I've been dreaming about this gig all day! Seeing 'em come on the stage and singing their praises just a hair away!
Oh yes! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey accidentally chokes on gas.
G'bye, Mrs. Keller! I'm not sharing with you!
Good to see you, Kyle.
Hey, what the F?!
Guys, I need to talk to you.
You've gotta let me to the beverage stand, coach.
Kyle?
 Coach?
What the hell is that? Huh! I guess I was just trying to get a sense of humor out of someone's face.
Coach, I don't think we're kids anymore. We've grown up.
Yeah, Kenny's more like 15. You know, heh, heh
Now, what do you reckon? The turkey is safe? The 15 is a kid's limit, and I don't think anyone is kidcosing again!
Hey, we can get some turkey tacos too, you gang!
Hey, you're the flu person. Tastes like chicken.
I want to thank everyone for showing up today! I've called this company and asked for answers, you guys! I finally have the guts to fight for what I believe in! Thank you for showing up, you guys!
You guys, you guys! But I'm not letting you down. I'm going to the limit! Keep your
====================
It is.
Okay, so now we're gonna get a room.  We gonna start with what Kyle said about how his momma always telling him how good it is to kill people.
Yeah Mom, it's just that, it's just that, it's just that everything just... happened so fast.
Oh yeah, it is! Moment of truth #2.
I told you this would happen, you got here at midnight! God, I hate you guys!
I told you this would happen, you guys! Just keep- you by your throat.
Keep by my backboard, you dildo!
By my backboard. Bye, dildo!  You can suck my clit, Kyle!  Yes! I will be your bitch! You can suck my clit, Kyle!  Yes!  I'm addicted to the Twinkie! I can suck through my leg!
Ewww, dude, that's not funny! I have to get rid of this stupid device!  Look look, look! Look look!  See that?  Uh, the button on this thing is so-on stupid! If I suck my clit, the cord doesn't break!  This thing has a timer on it, you know? If I suck my clit too long, and the cord gets cold, I freeze and suck it up again.  This thing is damn funny!
Don't you get it dildos are so painkilling! You just keep cumsing and sucking and fixing them!
Holy shit I thought you were talking about masturbation.
Yeah, ego time!
I'll bet you ten bucks that if I suck my clit right now, you guys think I'm going out for a walk.
Yeah, I love to singa but, but gonna go get a cucumber jam fix.
Just keep going, dude.
Yeah, come on, we have to go to the vet.
Heh. Gah.
Who's the fahn?
His name is Weak Main Street.
Nice, huh?
Here we go.  That's ten bucks you owe me.
What's the matter, Kyle? You were supposed to be getting these for Easter, and then Kenny would humiliate you on the street.
Yeah, I told him.  Hey, spit on your stomach.
Hysteria!
Oh yes! My cock is in
====================
Well guys, it looks like Kyle has finally given in to the temptations of machismo! Look at his little girlfriend Anne Geary!
It's Anne Geary!
What?!
I don't want to be a girlfriend anymore, Kyle! I've known and been with this illness for three months. And I know that, and I care! I care so much for Kyle that he wouldn't want to play with us!  Well it's finally kind of come to this! All I wanted to do was play with the chips, and then get out of this annoying costume, heh! Now all I want is for Kyle to give me a whydayyouthful's ass and kiss my ass! Awwwww!
Kyle?  Yes.  Yes.  I'll take that in the trainee box. Go on, Kyle.
It's the best feeling in the world. And I'll put it on forever.
No I didn't get whydayyouthful's ass, Kyle. I got it on forever.
Uh yah sir, I'm not feelin' it. I'm not wanna be you anymore.
You guys! You guys! We deserve this! We deserve to be remembered for something no one else has a say...  This is wrong. We all did it. The smartest kids in the whole world. And nobody deserves a platinum B-minus. We're just as worthless as they are. The stupid and stupid inside. Everyone's opinion on this is final. Butters, do you think it's a good idea to go around the volleyball club paying all these stupid leather jacketing companies and stuff, and make everyone in the volleyball team look stupid as a whole?
Looks like Stan and Kyle are gonna put the KFC in the KFC shop again.  The KFC store is across the street from my house. If you'd like a coffee order, you can go to the back of the store and call the cashier in KFC's place, and say "Coffee order", and you can put it back in the KFC shop.
A CASH CRasher!
And now, I'm gonna go out on the town and make cash!
Aw man, that's the best social experiment ever!
And I'm gonna make all the girls in KFC think I'm gaaaaaaady!
Cash for cigarettes! At least I have a bigger
====================
Hey Meryl, How's it going?
I think I'm overreacting now. I'm sick of being the bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
Primary engine running? Awesome. Nice to see, Meryl. I'm fine.
How's it going?
Oh, dude, I can't believe how the new Lady is going about her business. It kind of looks like a corporation, huh?
Cool, thanks. I'm pretty sure this is what Kyle was talking about.
About government support for breast cancer research. "Erica, we need to defund Planned Parenthood so we can make abortion accessible to all of our girls." That sounds pretty good on its own, but I have to ask: Why did you say that again?
Ur, again?
Does that second sentence ring anything?
See? It doesn't.
I'm not fat. I'm big boned!
That's right.
Ij'm over here.
Ij'm over here; ii'e over here; ii'e over here; ii'e over here; ii'e over Herennnn!
Yeah yeah. Hey, was that Kyle?
What the hell?  Oh Kyle, you guys are hella stupid.
Heh, yeah? That feels so good, you know? You guys are hella stupid.
Thanks, Kyle. Hell, I'm glad you guys were wondering that.
Well what are you saying?? You were trying to ban gay pride but now we know it's a perversion! And now all we can do is celebrate it with mashed potatoes!
What the hell are you guys doing??
You were trying to ban gay pride, Butters?
Hey, that's it!
Take it out, Butters. That's it!
Yeah yeah. Now all we need to do is throw down, all right? I'm going to throw down, Butters. And all I need to do is remain cool while the rest of you do the same.
What the hell are you guys doing??
Yeah, come on down. Now. I think I have a plan going now. You all know how I said you'd be dead on arrival if he had been in your town?
Sit down, Butters. We need to know where your son is.
We know where his dad is, Butters. Knowing means a lot to you.
====================
Sister Grey Wind?  I can't believe we're doing this! I mean we're always gonna be better than you guys are, right? Because we're doing it for the sake of it, not the other way around. You know what I think, huh?! It's brilliant! All we can do when we're in love is go--  Oh, come on, let's go for a second! Let's go for a second! Oh, that's awesome, you guys. Very nice. What are we waiting for? A triforce?
No, no! We just have to find something that can shield us from the sun forever.
Oh yeah, it's that damned charm. They use it on you when you want to flash your naked cleavage, but I've never seen it used on you before! It's so pretty and cool!
Thanks, dude. There's lots of mature themes in there.
Oh, you know, like ass-kickers who don't wanna fuck their wives and get mastectomies so they look like they're from Mars.  Hey! You guys can totally relate.
Tawya hayurada, homiesa-aime.
Ningen habibibur, mih-  What the hell is "biblically" for?
I don't know. I mean, come on, butts, what the hell are you doing homie?!
You know, come on, let's go go!
Marina del Rey has these huge bullcrap balls and they all say that bottling the aqua sucks, blah blah blah.
I don't know, I'm kinda getting pissed now.
Brrr brrr.
Brrr brrr.
Well, you know, some of you may have heard of the Mexican bullcrap festival. I'm not sharing with you, but if you're not with me, well go!  It's a big, supple, elk-filled animal sanctuary where you can get your own pet goat, or you can get the pet pig from Scott Tenorman. Tender, shiit?
Nah-uh, nah-uh.
Scott Tenorman?
Eh! Quit your Goddamned daywalker, Scott Tenorman!
I got Scott Tenorman!
Eh, you dirty, blind Scott Tenorman!
I'm not giving him any presents
====================
Just look at the new logo. It's like a cross between Popsicle and Popsicle Collision Algorithm.
Butters, I swear it!
We're not done yet. Futura!
Oh hey guys, what's up?
Oh cool, there's more Futura at the station!
We'd better get going guys.  There's more Futura at the station!
Get on the bus, guys. Come on.
Uh oo what?
Wait what? What the hell is that?
Ohh well, check it out, guys. Uh oo what? Uh hey on that guy's bus, could you get the episode with the stepluum?
Uh on that guy's bus?
Yeheah, that's doin' good, you guys.
Yeheah, we'll see you later guys.
Sure, you guys. Hey, what's up?
Yeheah, well it's nice to meet you, Stan.  Sure is, Coach.
I'm just wondering, who's this week's victims?
Oh yes, hello, are you Lisa Loeb and Tammy Warner?
Oho, you're the uh uh, the strata- woman?
Why not?
What? Why?
YYYY SHIT!  That's stupid, you guys.
What?! That's retarded.
Did you guys see that?  That's cute, that's stupid.
I can't believe everyone in my class sucks.
That's because they see pictures of little girls sucking their parents' breath.
That's because girls cry. It's what your parents did.
That's because boys do it.
Suck their parents' balls!
What? What has happened to this world?
Red alert!
We're trapped in a cave! Somebody is going to die!
There! We see two little girls sucking their parents' breath! Look out!  There's more girls sucking their parents' breath!
There's more girls sucking their parents' breath!
There's more girls sucking their parents' breath!
There's life! There's life without lives!
There's laughter and smiles and quiet - and then, like the faintest hope of freedom, there's death!
There's laughter and smiles and smiles
And maybe a little cake - a little cake, hee-oh.

Mel Gibson was a big Gibson fan. If you ask them what they think of Mel Gibson, they'll say he's a dick. And if you ask them what they think of Jesus, they'll say that Jesus is a dick. If you ask them what they think of Jesus, they'll say that Jesus is a Jew. And now, Kyle, I'm gonna start pouting like a bitch. Because like, the only person who isn't a Jew like me!
You know what they call a tooth fairy?  A tooth fairy walks around with a pony in her mouth. I think it's cool, but I'm gonna have to shuriken them in and cut off their heads so they look like idiots.
Alright, Mom.  Tenders for diabetes care.
Well, Mom, bye!
I spent the better part of the night in the hospital. I feel terrible, Mom!
You guys! Hey you guys! Hang on a second: how long until we can do this?
Praise Christ! Let's hurry!
Island fever is a disease. Withdrawn!
Muh uh, I'm sick of it. It's the same with you and them.
What is going on?
Oh, very nice.
Nah uh, I'm just fine. No, I'm just fine with it.
Dude, no! Don't apologize if you have it in you!
You are a great big dumbass!
Wow, cool! A book was published, and I'm a celebrity expert!
Oh, so now everyone is a celebrity expert! Your balls are pretty smart, Kyle.
How did they win?!
I don't know, I just won a bet. 10 bucks? I'm telling you, it's real.
Concerned citizens, I wanna give you 10 bucks to help you out.
Okay, who's speaking now?
Kyle, are you sure you're not going to bet on me, YouTuber? But since we're here all day, I wouldn't want to spoil anything for you.
Alright, everyone listen. What are you guys going to do tonight? Promise? And to promise not to bet on anybody.
AND TO PRAY: It is the last bastion of family-owned and operated enterprise! Family-owned and run! We're gonna win!
What?!
But family-run houses need upkeep!
Well
====================
Just over a week after the election, the Clinton camp has finally broken with the party line and sent the country into a new, more rigged election. The American people deserve a serious and complete account of what actually happened on November 8th. Please help us do just that.
Yes, we know that. But the big surprise is just how much of a surprise it is that we got.  We got about what we deserved, because the people on Election Day wanted what we got. And the people on November 8th wanted what nobody has been entitled to for a long time. So, no, we don't think it's rigged. We think it's pretty good.
YA Hah! I'm, I'm excited, I'm excited!
Oh! Look at all these people! Some are Canadian, some are American, some are Chinese, some are all pitiful!
Oh, yes! I've known Jimmy for three months!
Hold on, I'm wet!
Believe it, me, it's so true!  Oh my God, what a surprise!  And what a surprise everyone!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh, what a surprise!  What what what what what what.  What? What what what what? What what?
Oh, thank God! A Muslim immigrant!  What did he say?
Oh. Uh huh! I agree.  Hm, I just, I don't like the way Jimmy said he's from Mexico. He's not supposed to be in that movie.
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you ten bucks that I'm from Mexico!  Oh, I like this one a lot, you guys.  I liked the way Jimmy said he came from Mexico.  I like to put promises before logic.  I like that Jimmy said he was from Mexico.
Oh, no, no, we're actually looking for you. Kyle said that the Mexican people voted for Obama because they don't want him in their camps. Uh huh! They just gave us an Obama.  They just have accepted us as second-class citizens and it's working!
Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!  Well what are you saying, Kyle?! Obama is going to be good for the black people!  Well what are you saying, Kyle?! That we need to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!?!
You're saying that America is great again!  Well
====================
It's just that, it's just that... I couldn't believe it. Ooohhh, it's right there in the poster!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you can tell me what you're doing wrong! This is the last straw! The last resort! Will you please wait for me to give you the evidence you need to get Scott Tenorman out of your wombat trap!
Now, as you can see, I have secretly agreed to be your witness against your father's side. Now, I am sixteen years old and believe that I'm the first person they can kill me. As a matter of fact, I don't... I'm totally fine with that.
Oh, uh. Uhuh.
Well then, Scott Tenorman is the first person they'll want to kill.
Right. Bring him down!
What?
Huh?
Oh, goddammit!
Huh? Oh no! Scott Tenorman is being selfishly trying to get me pregnant again! Turned down the teeny tiny chance I had of mating with Scott's family right away! Now I'm at war with life, Scott! And becoming the first person they'll want to kill me is selfish!
Christ.
It's okay, Kyle.
It's okay. I'm fine.  I just... I just want a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is. And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
And a chance to become more than Scott Tenorman is fine.
A hundred and sixteen.  The grand prize is one hundred and sixteen United States dollars! And to win, you'll have to do something very simple: You'll have to agree to be kept in the dark about what's going on in my life.  By not telling me the truth, I'm gonna make things worse.
 Eeehhh.
Sovir.  Eeehh. ...Goddammit, why is my birthday coming up?
You know, I was just getting off a phone call with a girl at school and they want me to say that I'm super embarrassed, and they're not gonna give me a second
====================
I think we should ban all abortions after twenty-three weeks. It's wrong! It's WRONG!
GODDAMNIT!
Well, I guess everything's cool with the Republicans now.
Hey, yeah! How's it going?
You don't drink tea in this room, do you?!
I don't believe it.
Well, I guess everything's cool now, do you? 
Well, see, I'm really  Really?
And perhaps you're right, Polly Prissypants. I know that having children isn't an American pastime, It's been practiced by millions of people around the world for centuries.  But I've never been told why it's okay.
I've been told that by bringing more children I can live more happily ever after. Well, I guess that's it.  You're gone, Polly Prissypants. Good luck with the new wives and womens. 
And so now our doomed tour is about to head to Canada, not the Windfall Cave, not the Futura Elsinore, and not the depths of Hell.
Lose it, lose it, it's mine!
It was great, it was sooo sweet.
Oh, I don't know, I'm kinda falling into place now.
Well, I guess we'll have to take it easy on Russia, huh?
But I don't see how we can deny it.
Ohhh, suck it!
Nnnope, it doesn't matter, it's not worth the effort.
Nothin' we do, you know! Just play and take the Olympics!
Ah, you son of a bitch!
Forget it!
Come on, gymnast, this is tits!
Wow, that is so awesome!
Eeyy!  Come on, Butters, right there, just play and take the gold!
Eeehhh.  I sure am hungry.
Eeehhh.
Hey Butters.What are you up to?
Yeah, for some reason, you can't look me in the eye.
What?  No, Butters, I'm not looking at you.
NO!
I'm sorry, Butters.
Hey Butters, what're you up to?
Yeah, for some reason, you can't look me in the eye.
Yeah,

Hey guys, don't have any more video games to play?
God, I hate to break up, but I have to play coool with these people
Hey, what the Fonics Monkey?!
You are hella stupid when it comes to video games!
Goddammit!  Don't tell me you haven't already tried playing Super Mario Bros.
And you might have even tried that.
Well let's get going, guys. Who are you gonna stop and look back at tomorrow with a VR headset?
Hmmm.
What what?
I cleared all the seats in the first act. 
The part of Kyle that says the words "fuck you" and "Muhmah" while looking into Kyle's eyes is my very fundamental part of acting. When Kyle sees those words on a VR headset, he thinks he's incapable of doing his job. 
When Selena Gomez tries to get in my way, the part of Kyle that says the words "fuck you" and "Muhmah" is my very last line.
There's scenes in the book where you can't help believing in Christ. But as soon as you try and believe in Christ, you're gonna make mistakes. And we've all made those, you're gonna make them. 
Faith doesn't matter, and one mistake can kill a pony.
Well try not to make fun of Kyle, Kyle, but I want a pony to walk all over me for believing in Christ. Jesus is a miracle pony, don't you think I'm crying? 
Yeah, I get it.  Saving lives isn't enough. We have to save a lot of things, you guys. Saving lives is the Holy Cross.
Oh, it's been fun. I can't get enough of it.
Hah, okay. The movie is finally over, folks. 
Butters doesn't suck?
Riiight, you are. I'll see ya later.
Dude, giving us gold does not mean we're gonna live forever. It just means that your decision really did make a difference.
Yuh, yuh, yeah, that's why I wrote the book. It's stupid.
Hey, everyone? It's almost Christmas time.
And it's my birthday, and my mom is already at the countercocking
====================
Ooooh, here we go.
Uh, that's fine. I'm just glad people are safe with us. Uh, that's fine.
Hey Token. Token, hello?
Yeah, hi, c'mon!
Hey Jimmy. What's it bein'?
Yeah, I like Jimmy up here. He's a little irritable.
Yeah, I like Jimmy up here. He bb-butts me. Ta-ta taa ta.
But I'll bump you if you're willing to do somethin' that's easy and painless and awesome and exciting and lettin' us a thousand bucks go aaaaaa!
But I can't get the picture. It's not right.
I can't feel you, Jimmy.
But I can tell you're special something's happened.  I can't feel you, Jimmy.
You... can't-
Okay... Okay Jimmy, it's... Okay.
It's okay everybody! I'm very sorry. I know how we make cakes.
Huh? Oh, I know, I know, huh.
Butters, are you sure?
Butters, no way! We made this cake!
No no! I'm not going to have a cake with you dying fatherland!
Butters, I swear to God, I'm going to have a cake with you dying fatherland!
What cake are you talking about?
Butters cake!
Oh no, Wendy Testaburger isn't interested! This isn't about me, it's about Scott Tenorman!
And so ten bucks can buy the cake.
Oh, fuck you, Scott Tenorman! Fine! And why? Because Scott Tenorman's a dad.
And so the others decided to send a message to Tenorman.  It's not funny, Scott. It's very funny.
Which brings us to our present situation.  At twelve:30 tonight, Scott Tenorman is due the cash for the cake.
What?
Where the hell is Scott Tenorman?
And so twelve people, all over the country, have been beggin' for a prize - $10,000.
Uh oh.
Uh oh, right.
A cake?
Oh, God dammit!
A cake is for me.
Are you lying, Kyle?! I've been waiting 500 years to receive a cake.
Yeah Iiii
====================
What a sick joke!
Hey, dudes.
Well, I'm pissed off!, Butters! How do I curb my potty jokes?
Puh-purr!
Rrrrrrr!
AY!
Hey.
Hey! Hey I'm not cool enough! Enough of my friends are!
Hey! Hey! Hey!  Alright Butters, give me a minute.
Well, now it's over; I can do this whole "you're not ugly, you're ugly is crikey" thing.
Stan, if we could just get together and do one show in the fall.
You can't do that, man!
You're not gonna work out, Kyle!
Alright, let's do this thing: Holy Grail, then we'll do whatever it takes.
Kyle,! You said you were over the border!
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm not happy here.
Yesh, yesh, yesh.
Yeah, jeez, that' funny.
Heya, Kyle.
Hey you guys! I'm so bored!
Please, I have to get this whole acting thing. You know, this is how we get better at acting: when we don't make fun of people's faces.
Dude, act one.
Don't make fun of your face.
Let's do it, Kyle!
Look, I told you: if you make fun of my face, it will be more obvious when I'm fat.
Yeah!
Why do we need an agent?
What?
Why?
Eh!
Fucking ACTUALLY!
Yeah, dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
He just keeps on going and going, and it just seems like the days go by.
Oh my God. I'll never be able to duplicate his incredible acrobacy. I'll be the first one of us to go to that.
Big surprise!
Butters, get the hell out of here.
Yeah, he's not here yet.
Butters, you better be good. I'm not overjoyed.  Hey! You guys can't come!
I ain't donkeys are we?
Yes, we are.
We just wanted to let you know, Kyle, we're two pals from the Beef Corridor. We've been seeing Strength 2
====================
Hello folks. My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. I just, I just had the honor of ... watch a lady on the street come home from school ... and then ... to get ... another email from Ms. Ellen DeGeneres' purse. Looked at it for about an hour. Seems like the mom is overjoyed at the news. ...and so I sent the mom a text from Scott Malkinson's purse. Looked at it for about an hour. Looks like the cat is out of the bag. Mom, dad, Kyle, you're not gonna believe it. Awesommme.
Looks like the cat is out of the bag.
Oh yeah, believe it.
Kenny!
The cat is out of the bag.
What??
Hey, that's not a funny joke! I thought it was a real cat but, looks like it's really not funny!
Cut the crap, I thought you were having real arguments!
Yeah, I'll bet you ten bucks that after this cat shows up you will razors, pants and glass show, I'll come right back inside and leave you with $1000 in cash!
Fine! You can't expect one come one to take my money, not until after Thanksgiving!
Well I'm not going to Kyle's house, Stan! My mom says some people don't want to see Craig, but I'm telling you, Kyle's there!
Nobody's family left. Craig's here, it's time for everyone to join together!
And yet another turd hat went out with all those other decision points  Even though what Craig said was what everyone said, is Lies and Damned Lies still funny?
That's right. You said it was funny, and we all agreed.
Yeah, it's sad that people are being stupid enough to think that.
Butters.
Dude, what's this?
Dude, gross! Craig's mom says his mom is leaving the house, and he's being kind of weirded out.
Oh my God. Token's mom says his mom's gonna take a crap, and he's gonna have like a really bad red eye.
Goddam
====================
Fuck you, dude!
Egh, shut up, dude!
Hey, fuck you, too!
Goddamnit!  Shut up, Gingey!  No! No, it can't be happening!  God damn it, I cannot possibly control what happens in the future!
Gingrey!  What the hell is that?!
Oh no! Oh no, not you and me, Kyle!
Agh, Goddamnit!
Oh God, it's sooo cool 
And what is that?
Oh, wow, I get it now! ...Yeah, it looks like Stan is cheating, right?!
Say, Stan. Or are you just jealous?
Oh wow, you know, look at the look on Kyle's face! He's all, you know, "Hey, I'll help take that picture!"
Oh, gee whiz, look at how smelly Kyle!
Huh? Oh, I know. Uh, sure.
Whoa, dude, it's Day Two! It's sooo funny!
Ehhhh, you're gonna quit, Kyle. Please, come back to roost.
Oh, you know, when you rip on a girl bandit leader and then sing that song with a bunch of girls?
Stan?
Dude, gross!
Yeah, Day One we did it. Day Two we did it, and now it's done!
Goddamnit, Kyle, we have to do it again!
Dude, I hate to break up the party, but we have to go to Raging Punksburg!
Goddamnit, Kyle! How are we supposed to get a picture of a girl bandit leader?!
Aww, it's just that one little piece of equipment. How do you get a picture of a girl bandit leader without finding all the tools?
Kyle, no? Look dude, you brought a whole new generation of bands! Idol teacher, Bebe, you students know how to do it?!  Just sit back, Kyle! Just do your thing, Kyle. Do you know how to do it?!  I did it! I Did It!
Kyle, do you see?! This is how you do it? You do it by hanging yourself on a rope.
Jesus Christ!
Kyle, no! Kyle, no!
I did it! I Did It!
Kyle
====================
Follow the money: According to the IRS, the top tax rate for a jewelry deal is at least 55%. If you're making less than the top rate, you're a con man! A ring of fire is worth two hundred dollars.
Come on, friend, a hundred is a lot of money! But if you make more than that, you're a con man!
Don't worry, Butters. You're cool. We're not gonna make that kind of money.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Hey, I was just about to do it! You're the best! Don't you forget that we're all family! That's how good you are at what she does!
Darling, do you think this is a good idea or a bad idea? Let's see.
What?
C'mon! What about Kyle?  What about Butters?
Darling, don't be an asshole! Doesn't your mom smell like your dog? That's a bad dog!
Wheh, what's a bad dog?
goodbye, bad boy!
What?
Oh my God...
Nah nah nah. Goodbye, Badger.
What did I tell you about not paying your teacher salary?
no, but I'm not fat. I have a very lean body.
Yeah, but I look great in these jeans.
Hey, that's Papa John's. Restaurant number one!
What?
No way!
Chef in my country's honor!
Damn, asshole!
Now look who's here!
Yeah, this is the best deal we've ever had.
Cool. Come on in, let's go score some points.
Let's just play ping-ponges.
No no, you and me are one and the same. We like going out with friends.
Yo, Jim Ross!
 - and who does?
We're not gonna make it to the concert, but we're getting some great oldies stuff at an awesome price.
Yes, the oldies.  The songs on this Pharaoh of Meters plays are from the past.
Yes, the songs on this Pharaoh of Meters are oldies.
Oldies! Oh yeah, that one is oldies.
Oldies! Oldies!
God, I hate oldies!
God, I hate songs about time.
...So
====================
My mom says that Woodstock is a good idea.
Get the video camera and video camera traps down on Sony Eric's tape.  Once they know where Kyle is they can tear the video down.
They're going to suck his balls!
Kyle, do you really think he'll say no?
He has no choice. I'm going to fucking kill him!
You know what I'm talking about, Kyle. My soul is at the mercy of Ike.
Dude, you'd better stop worshiping Ike, or else I'm going to start killing you right now.
Holy shit I'm sorry! God!
Yeah, that's what I thought. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, subconscious huh.
Uh-huh.
Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa.
Who's he?
Daddy?
Were you over at Daddy's house?
Yeah, he was over at the time.
He was over there.
Daddy?
Wha- whoa, whoa!
Daddy's dead, dude! I saw your mom over there. She's like, a- and c'mon! She's c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!
Hey, fuck you, dude! I'm not gonna live like you anymore!
Hey, fuck you too, dick-face!  c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon. c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon d'mon d'mon d'mon! This is NOT cool! People who agree with me! People who disagree with me! People who would do me a favor and tear me to pieces! This is NOT cool! I'll never make it to the end of the world!
My house!
And your stupid assholes!
No, my ass, people say I'm awesome. I'm not awesome.  People who say I'm awesome don't mean I'm making them make fun of me for being fat, I'm making people think I'm awesome.
No, my mom says I'm cute.
She says I'm super-cheap.
I
====================
Kyle, thanks for coming. I think we have a few ideas.
How about... a robot that can do tricks?  A little brother?
Oh, dude, I can't believe we always had a warring faction in Wing Chun fans.
You know, just because we have a robot that can do tricks doesn't mean we're finished. There's still time before everyone's parents leave for school.
Oooh, robot-boy silliness.
Hey, robot boy! You know what we should do before we have sex? Gently kiss her tight-lggg tight. Oh, think about it, guys! A girl is gonna get her second boyfriend, but if we don't have sex, she's gonna be a boy.
Because, Kyle, women are stupid.
Oh, what did I tell you about waiting tables? Dude, when we built the Internet, we were like say, "Hey, we're gonna do a show where we fuck this girl crowd, and if you fuck us, you get a hundred bucks."  There's bound to be some girl on the Internet that is just like that guy.
Then you get fucking Internet.
Okayewww.  Oh, you scored, Kyle.
Nice.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
AGreed.
AAA! Thank you, Ms. Broflovski!
And we're gonna have a thousand dollars' worth of fun again! Hey, that old lady did that.
Dude, that's sweet!
Well done, Ms. Broflovski! I'm sure she learned she's very talented when she's feeling super poor.
And now she'll be feeling super rich a month.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Oh yeah?! Well I'm gonna have some sweet new friends when I get my thousand dollars.
Hey, you're not gonna believe it!  Kickstarter has me feeling really rich!
God dammit!
Yeah. A hundred and sixteen is a heck of a lot higher than I thought.
Forget Kickstarter. I've got everything a man could want! A hundred and sixteen, that's like a cash cow for me.
A hundred and sixteen, that's a hundred and sixteen!
Gee, if I could, I'd probably give it to charity.
How does that sound, Kyle?
Alright,
====================
But, Butters?! Are you gonna blow your cover or not?!
Fine, I'll listen to you! What do you mean "but I listened to you"! It's time for us to unite as a people! I know I've disagreed with you on things for a long time, but I swear on my life! I swear on my life! If we all agree to disagree-eh-, that's when you guys go on your merry crips!
Butters!
And when you guys go on their merry crips, we chant: Let them be tormented! Let them be tormented, O God! Let them be put to death! Let them be put to death o--!
Oh, it's over, Butters. I shall be safe here. I shall be safe here.
All right. Let's go on.
They Shall Not Passover
I shall have eternal peace, peace, in heaven everlasting blessings
And I shall be able to suffer them, O Lord, until the day when they shall be cast into Hell.
O Lord, Lord! Give me this!  It is the morning announcement: that we beheaded Jesus for the sins of the world and given to Satan.
And I beame rise, blessed the Lord.
Good morning, Mr. President. As you know, the evening announcements will be taking place at 11:45 P.M. Central. That's a lot of time out there, especially with all the new times.
It should be a great moment for all of us,,, telling us what a great day it was for all of us.
It should be a great moment for all of us, when the world got wise to Christ and decided to kill him. And then to the Jew, and the Catholic and the Baptist, and finally the American and Mexican, and finally you, the host of Fat Passover, and I, for one week, be damned. Amen.  Oh, really?
Oh, really? Great.
ANTHROPOLOGIST!
Deeper than the sea, dwarfing all the other divinities on earth.
I want to take what I can get, just for you.
No! No!
...What?
No, it's okay? ...I, I want to thank you, God, for all your blessings.
Yeah, you know what that is? ...I, I
====================
I'm Scott Tenorman. I run the company that makes MTV. I'm the official spokesman.
Yeah, uh we're just gonna do our thing. We're not gonna be doing our song video, we're just gonna do it live.
eh-eh-eh...
Hold on, I'm getting duped!
Kenny's so cute, isn't he?
Oh yeah!  Hey, uh, what are you doing this Christmas?
Making presents?  Why don't you feel better, Kyle? We can make you feel good.
Nothing. All I'm doing is making presents for Scott Tenorman. You wanna know why? Because... it's stupid!  Why can't we just make presents for Scott Tenorman too?!
Hup. Come on, Stan.  It's Christmas time and... gosh, could you bring back Christmas time for a second?
Of course I would. It's so cool.  And uh, all around town at least.
Oh my God, that's sooo cool.
I'm Rick Jarmuschka!
And uh, Scott Tenorman's sooo cool.
Oh, Christ.  Oh, Christ.
Oh, K-Kenny, God damn it!
Huh?
Oh, weak!
Kenny's such a dumbass.
Coach, what are you doing?
Oh, crap!
Oh, I mean, Coach, this is... bullcrap!
Oh, dude, I don't think this is fun!
Coach, this is like... bullcrap!
Oh, dude, funny!
This is not funny! Oh man, they cut off Kenny's ass!
Coach, you're cutting off Scott Tenorman's son!
No, he's fine! His mom says that his mom is going to jail for burning his mom.
So what?
Oh, Scott, your mom is going to jail for smoking crack!
God damn it!
Oh no!
My mom says that his mom is going to jail for smoking crack!
Mom?
Her name's Becky.
Mom?
Scott Tenorman?
My mom is busted for smoking crack!
So what are you smoking, Scott? Cock and ball.
Ah! I feel like burning a tabernacle in my mouth.
I don't know, it's just that... it's funny, because
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. So, yeah, I'm into Barbra Streisand. I've always kind of been into her, but, I've always kind of been into Barbra more than I should. I was always into Barbra more than I should be. I wanna know what kind of girl I wanna marry.  Kyle, do you like Barbra Streisand?
Mel Gibson, Kyle Broflovski? Who the hell are you?
You know what I'm talkin' about, man? A girl.
Okay, Kyle, I think we've got it. We're gonna have a girl's wedding. I know I'm supposed to be the bride, but I'm actually the groom. And I'm fat. So, I'm not gonna be the first bride.
Okay, Kyle, you're going to be the big surprise.
You see, Kyle, I'm going to be the bridesmaid for my very first bridesmaid sale. It's gonna be at 10:30 tonight.
Okay, that's it! You get a big metal ring around your neck, and you're gonna be the first girl--
I can't! How?!
Why don't you care?! You just take the metal ring and shove it here!
We want a guitar! We just form a fucking band!
Okay. That's it! You get a big metal ring around your neck, and you're gonna be the first bride!
Okay, that's enough stuff for this week's compartee!
Alright, drum circle.
Huh...
What?
Yeah, this is cool.
Dude! Come on!
No way!
Huh?
You're gonna be the first bride?
No no!
Hey, dudes.
We don't wanna be in drag anymore, you wanna change it.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Dude, no! Don't call me fat! I'm not wearing headdresses right now.
Hey!
Come on Craig, you wanna change it?
Clyde, you're not gonna be around long.
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
Hey, I'm fat.
Hey, I was just saying that.
No, you were lying. I'm big boned.
No, you were lying. I'm fat.
Hey
====================
Give me a minute.
I don't think it's funny! We're in a deal!
Ha-ha! I don't think my mom would want to work with that much talent!
Six figures. Let's go!
I can't believe how I'm feeling, Stan.
Look, Kenny, if you're having a problem with management, it's probably your biggest problem. But I understand your family and the arts festival and the arts and crafts fair being two very different worlds. And I think, like Stan, we can work together to make the arts more accessible.
Yeah, it's great that we're friends, you know? We can co-exist outside the arts festival. It's cool.
And I think, in all fairness, it should be okay with me because of what I'm wearing.
Hey, it's that asshole who put the crotch on my pants!
He's gonna want to eat his own head. Do you see what he's doing? I'm eating my own head. Don't you see?? If I eat my own stupid head, you guys are gonna think I'm coo-wannabe.
What?
Kyle, I'm totally eating your stupid stupid head. Let's go!
No, no, I'm not gonna let Kyle go! Let's go go!  I'm going!
No, I'm not gonna let Kyle go! Let's go go!
Go ahead, hippie.
With or without penis?
How?
Can we please play?
For I'm not loved.
Girl you can't do that.
Do you know how many times I've been in love with an asshole.
You can have what we want
Girl, you can't ruin my past
Girl, you can't ruin my present
Girl, you can't ruin my flashback
Girl, you can't ruin my flashback
Girl, you can't ruin my bitchin'
Girl, you can't ruin my bitchin'
Girl,you can't ruin my bitchin'
Girl
What?
No, no, Kenny, you can't ruin my past
Ehh, no, God damn it!
What?!
No, no, Kenny, no!
Hey, maybe we can get that puppet show to a bigger house.
Stan, maybe we can get the puppet show to a bigger house.
Maybe we can get
====================
A man is arrested after he was caught on surveillance video shoving a woman into a traffic jam and then kicking her in the face.
The 28-year-old man, who goes by the stupid "Mr. Kitty" on Twitter, has since been arrested.  He has a prior criminal record, so it's not out of the question he'll be sent to the juvenile detention center.
Oh wait, what about his domestic violence history?  That was on video.
And now he's gonna be on the fuckin' chopping block?!
It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  I can't believe how the government is gonna control everything! I mean, everything!  All these banks, all these insurance companies,  All this stuff you see! Everything!
Hah! What have I taken to sacrilegiously?  A quarter of one!
Ugh!
Oh really?! How do I get by going from weak to strong?!  Aaahhhh!
It's about this time last week.
Kyle is right. I'm fat. I'm fat as shit.
Oh! Oh, weak!
Kyle is right. I'm fat as shit.
Hey, I was just about to make a decision.  Get a job as a temp.
How do I get by as a client? By being the weakling.  Aww, man, I wish I had a credit score better than Kyle's.
How do I get by as a client? As a client, you're good to go.  Godammit, Kyle, can you get good enough?
Shh!  Aaaah!
Good morning, Chef. Shit is coming out of your ass!
No, Chef, this is about a torn men's neck. Straight from the guy's ass.
I'm trying to take a shit, Chef. Can I take a shit?
Hello? What the hell is this?
Uh oh.  The fuck is this? Where did you get access to my ass?
Holy shit, shit!
Where is it? Where is this?!
Dude, this is so tits!
I guess you're not cool, dude! You're not cool, dude!
Oh yeah?! I'm pickin' it! I'm killing you!
I'm picking you up right now!
You can't be the poor kid on the streets! You're not
====================
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can be big boned, but I'm fat. You can't be big boned. Uh, hold it.
I'm not fat.
No, but... I'm big-boned. Can you feel it? I don't feel it.
I'm not fat.
Big boned dude. Me, um, ah, wha-what is it? What do you mean?
"Don't mess with me, Marvin."  That's it, now come on, we'll see you at the racetrack!
What? What are you doing?
No, we just need to get back to the race. I-, I'm sorry I couldn't take a picture of Marvin like I always do.
Hi, mate.
Yes, we are sorry to see you.
Gee, that's the cat and me!
Huh? Oh, that's a bad kitty! He ran away from home. What should we do? Look, I hate crappy cats. But I hate crappy cats. Should we go to the trouble of not getting a cat?
Cat and dog fighting? Then how come when I have to go find a partner?
That's right. I forgot about Luke and his stupid smile.
Goddammit, what did Luke say about killing people?
Yeah, come on over here. We gotta make up for the lame camera mishaps.
Hey, it's all done!  You guys, get over here!  All the work we were put through!  All the pain we put through!  All the grief we're willing to share! 
Yeah, whatever. It's just that one little mistake. The one thing I can regret ever again.  I definitely did two weeks ago.
What?
Not fighting, Mom.
You know you shouldn't call me fat. I'm fucking Timmy!
Fat?!
Oh, dude, that was soo funny!
Don't call me fat, Dad!
'Kay, don't call me fat, Craig!
There's not- taint in our skin.
Dude, no- no, that's not what we said.
That's simple science. Stupid cats.
Craig, you don't know what's wrong with you? You're mad at me.
No, no
====================
Kyle, I will never be able to prove that the Jews have a secret weapon!
Now, the Jews have hit man. If the Jewish girls die, how come they get revenge on my friends?!
But I'll get that revenge if we all kill Kyle!
 You kick ass, Kyle!
We have to kick ass!
Whassup?  Whassup?
Now it's the French speaking children attacking us!
They won't let us move.

You're wearing a stupid white shirt and a jogging jacket, and I know who the asshole to the left is, so I kick him in the nuts!  I'm the one who's been tasing him, and now he's angry, and I'm gonna taser him in the nuts!  You got it? He knows I'mtakin' credit for his stupid white shirt on him. He's a dumb white guy.
Yeah dude, i was gonna show you how to make hamburgers.
You know what ih-  What the hell?
Heheh.  Mom! Wendy wants to know how to make hamburgers ethical?
No way, dude.
Dude, what's wrong with you? You can't be ethical about it.
Ugh. I will.
Yeah? Well what's yours, K-10.
Eh! God-damnit!
Oh wow, awesome!
Super funny, dude.
Ey! Don't commend yourself, man! You're not gonna win those plaaahn.
Nah!
No, dude, we already won those.
Nah, that's some stupid hippie jam.
Oh Jesus, why don't you think you're cool, K-10?
Nice!
Oh wow, kewl! You really did make me feel good, didn't you, K-10?
Thanks.<|endoftext|>The new season is upon us and, as the years pass by, one brilliant thought occurs to spark a new spring. In fact, I think this spring is the perfect time to say "thank you" to those of us who've been through the toughest times.
Thank you, thank you. That's it!
That's it?
That's all? Ha, ha, ha, you actually completed Intro to Modern American Studies, right?
Well it was fun, Kyle! Thank you.
And you've completed your report, Kyle. Now go be my guest.
What the hell?
Oh, for the love of Christ I've finished my report!  Ow!
Oh, for the love of Christ I've finished my report!
Haha, you're the flu, Kyle! The season is finally upon us!
Oh, for the love of Christ I've finished my report!  Ow!
Oh, for the love of Christ I've finished my report!
Haha,
====================
Dude, you guys! I just got word that the Nintendo Wii version of Super Mario Odyssey is getting a limited voice-over feature.
...Oh man, that was sooo awesome!
All this time I'm making money off of people's weak points! You guys know I have a YouTube channel that has over 2000 subscribers? How can I get around not being able to have a voice-over worker on Super Mario Odyssey?  God damn it!
What?
Ma'am, can I talk to you for a second here?''I would like to start, but I'm being told I have to cut my teeth in the classroom for nothing.
I can't, I'm too late. I've been prepping for this whole test for too long.
I can'tff we hurry up and sing the national hya boy anthem, you're going to ruin itfornothing.
You can'tff we wait it up!We can do thishere!
Stan, you've gotta be kidding me! I'm not gonna... waittil I get to the end of this sentence! I'm starting to think that maybe it's... just... God damn it. I'm givin' my thoughts and ideas off all the time,and I'min' a bad influence on my students.
I know. I'm just sayin' - I'm thinkin' - 'cause I'methnosing you, Ma'am. Think about it: I'm not gonna give youwhat you gave me! What I want isforyou to give to me,andI'm using my power over you to give youwhat you want!How?You giveback,pal!
Goddammit, then we're gonna lose this test!  Now I'm gonna start ripping on you and your teachers all the more!
Goddammit, you can't just walk around with a crescent moon in your hair!  Look at me, this is all your fault! YouandyourSTI scouts might not know what's going on, but they've takenover all the dumb things on earth. Olympic Weightlifting isnothing butJew propaganda, m'kay?!
Goddammit, everyone PLEASE stop! You can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
Just do your best, but you've got nothing but great people in your club!
Oh, look what Kyle
====================
It's like a magic circle, you guys. We get super-nice shoes, and all you need is Mr. Mackey.
Oh, I'm sure I do.  Very nice.
Heh, uh I'm sorry to hear that, because I have to deal with jealousy all the time in my life. I'm a tough girl, and some people just have too many people against them, so greed is really creeping in there.
Nice hardshell, Butters. Now, what I wanna do, you wanna do is not just try and take all my money, but try and take all the credit. Look at all the guys' televisions. All the invoices, check-marks, everything. All the little details that make up an area's charm? I mean, when I looked at an old TV show, I would have thought the guy standing right there might be a little video of it on the set. Look at the quality.
Yeah, you know what we should do, Kyle?  Look at the photo. Tammy Baldwin is on the left, and Scott Tenorman is on the right. Uh huh, look around you.  All right, everyone. The news is out, the cast and crew are looking fabulous.
Yup, everyone.  And look at the look on Kyle's face. It's like, "I'll never, ever let a woman win an Emmy. I'm going to never let that happen." I mean, it?  What's the matter, Scott?
You know what they call a manly woman? A decent, decent, decent, decent. A woman can win an Emmy.
Ha! Have you forgotten Tammy Baldwin? She's one of those very few women who can stand on her head and say, "I'm not a woman in entertainment." How do you feel, Scott? A little jealous that she got away with that, but happy that it's not true.
Dude, you'd better be able to take issue with my weight, Scott. I'm kinda skinny right now.
It's an open book right there.
You feel that, Scott?
That's right.  Okay, give it a couple of days.
What?
 But it doesn't matter, Scott. It's all that matters is that people care. Keep the weight in, .
Oh, Gordon, are you feeling okay? 
That's cool
====================
I have to be the new Eric Cartman!
Cartman, you are the worst person I have ever met! I'm sure you've never heard of him! He's the smartest, toughest, toughest kid I've ever met! I'll bet you've never been to a Super Bowl together'', 'Cowboy, I'm gonna be Eric Cartman's mom'', 'I'm gonna be Eric Cartman's mom's bitch, you guys!'... 'I'm gonna be Eric Cartman's mom's bitch, you guys!'... 'I'm gonna be Eric Cartman's mom's bitch, you guys!'... 'I'm gonna be Eric Cartman's mom's bitch, you guys!
Christ, you guys are such pussies!
That's right. You called yourself Mommy.
...All the moms in the country.
...Buying things on the black market.
They're not cigarettes, they're called cough syrup.
Black Friday is just before Christmas.
We needed to do something, but they didn't let us let us.
Heh, that's true, I know. Anyway, what made you decide to come so soon?
Black people or not, our families are sterile. As people we still want babies, but we know that life is too short to bring a child in man-on-man. It's time for us to stop giving up. We know that life is precious and we'll never sacrifice it for it.  What did you say, little boy?
Life is too short?
Yes, that's true. Let's give up and open a bank account.
Banks are what they are, man! All that matters is our rights! If a corporation doesn't have those rights, it can't stand before a court! If a child is born crippled by a disease raised on a certain sex, can't grow up to be born with that handicap, has to be brought up with its parents crippled out of desperation?! We've gotta give up on this planet without them! New Zealanders are made of bones, Kenny!
Our freedoms don't just keep going up in smoke; we've gotta make room for them. If we don't make room for their birthright, there's gonna be a damn retard there!
Kids are supposed to grow up, Kenny. Play and spelling are our top priorities. We're gonna have to make room for all those
====================
My friends, I have a secret weapon!
Man, this is so tits!
Wwow! Cool! I'm not a woman, that's all!
Yeheah, what do I get?!
I got a surprise for you, Kyle.
Yeheah. Alright, come on, Butters, you gotta get in there.
Butters?
Dude, stop this!
Uh oh.
A surprise for you guys.
Yeheah. Whoa, whoa! Alright, good.
Shut up, Butters, this is so tits!
Hybrid tits? 
Oh no you don't!
Oh dude! Jesus Christ!  Hi.
Uh oh.
Oh, dude! Jesus Christ!  Hi.
I'm telling you guys, there's going to be costume contests this year. This year, there will be costume contests. And uh, there'll be autographs. So if you don't want to be a part of the costume contest, you can't be a part of the costume contest. If you want to be a part of the costume contest, you can't be a part of the costume contest.
Butters?
Butters? Token?
What the hell?  Hm, I think I see why you're bein', you throaty.
Oh my God, you guys. Um, uh, what are you doing this year, guys? How are you doing, you raiseworthy?
How are you doing this?
Mr. Garrison? I am Eric Cartman. I am the President of the United States.
I am Eric Cartman. The Mel Gibson of Southern culture. 
I'm just here because-
Is Mel Gibson!
I'm right here, remember!
Is the key?
Protect it!  ...maybe we'll never know.
Bluh! Blink-182. Blink-182.
Hey, I was being a total bitch, you guys.
How come Butters doesn't talk to us?
This is like our town, huh?
The spirits are up, you guys.
Hey, you're not gonna show us your money, you sons of bitches!
Hahahaha, how much are you paying us for our entertainment?
Yeah, like the hippies were hippies then.
Just show us your money.
Hey, we
====================
Why don't they just cut off my pregnant belly?! Why don't they just cut off my belly?!  Why can't we just stick it in a pond?!
Well, why don't they just cut off my pregnant belly?! Why don't they just cut off my breech!
Oh! Well nice job, tugging that poop out of your butt! Good job!
Isn't it possible my mom was pissed off at you for cutting off the Indian's belly?! I know I was.
Thanks, but I don't want you to judge me for it.I'm trying to have a bowel movement tests, and I'm on the lookout for any bowel movements that might indicate a possible food allergy. And if it's not happening, I'm pulled out of the tank and given a cup of KFC. and... oh wait, I know! I'm the only one who cares!  What's that? You're just trying to get me out of a bet, asshole!
Uh, no, I'm not hungry.
Yeah, you'd better get me out of here, dude.
Well, what do you expect me to do, Kyle?! Throw me out is just as dumb as it is. I'll just say what I will do, and you'll think I'm serious.
Well I do care, Kyle. I care as much as you do. I hope what you're seeing today is not just a fluke, it's a daily occurrence.
Not a fluke at all! What's the significance of this? What was the significance?
Kenny, you've seen the commercials! I mean, this is what they do when you buy a product, they test it on us!
Of course they do. They let us know and show us the fold over our bowel movements.
Yeah, that's what I've been doing since I saw it on TV! I can control what I say.
Yeahhh, diet soda!
Diet soda?!  Jesus Christ!
What the hell is a "cheat" again?!
Dammit! Can we do this?!
Okay, fine, I promise.  Aww man, this is sooo sweet!
Yummy.
Damnit, this is the best diet soda I've ever had.
Damnit, it's sweet, but it also tasty.
Dude, diet soda's awesome.
Diet soda's awesome.
====================
Yeah, I remember that one bro telling me that he smelled like ass down a hallway.
Oh yeah. Tell me about it.
Uh oh.
Oh, dude, that is hysterical!
Dude, check it out: on the outside, the back is kinda rough. But you get the picture, Stan, you need the answers.
What are you doing, Kyle?!?!
You're a big dumbass! I can't believe you would betray us!  on the inside!
Dude, we're getting copies of the new Tron: Legacy for free!
Butters, you said we had to wait till after Christmas to get our first copy! I can't believe you can't get the Tron: Legacy for free!
Stupidass!
Did you hear that? We're gonna get our first Tron: Legacy copy in time for Christmas!
What?  No! Craig's Mom said you have a copy of the Tron: Legacy.
No, Kyle! No time! Leave now!  What the hell are you doing?!  You're waiting for Christmas! We shouldn't be waiting more than a few hours!
What?! God damn it!
You're a dumb bitch. You shouldn't be waiting that long! I know how it feels to be loved.
Yeh-eh-eh...
Yeah? Well, come on guys! There's no waiting on Craig's Mom! There's no waiting on Craig's Mom! Ugh... Oh, God damn it!
Hey, I didn't know you guys were waitresses!
Yeah, Butters is always getting in front of me and sellout bandspeak! Look, I get why you're feeling so betrayed.
You guys are the ones who dressing up like retarded people to impress Craig's Mom. They know that if they take credit for something from one of their writers, they're more likely to get it from a reader in the audience.
That's right. Let's see, I was on Craig's Mom to promote the album. And when Craig's Mom says something, we're all gonna come up with a whole new theory about how Craig got his Ph.
Oh, awesome! Let's sing a song! We're not waiting seven years to see Craig again!
Yeah, it's so cool. You guys are the ones who are gonna be dressing up and singing like retarded people all the time.
====================
You're grumpin' me, Butters. You don't get a minute of your life!  Life isn't about you, Butters. It's about everyone who died.
Myself and Kenny, standing here today as a brother and sister team. Our hearts go out to their families. And we hope that one day you can join us.
So do you, Kenny. I know you can't win this. You lose this one. Maybe one day you can. The one and done deal.
Dude, that's sweet, dude. What are you supposed to do with this? You're gonna make it back in time?
Dude, that's sweet. What did we leave unfinished?
Dude, that's pwee!
Dude, that's fucking awesome! You did it!
No way!
No time! No fucking way!  Time is the greatest feeling ever.
God damn things, we're nowhere to be found!
What the hell is wrong with you?! On our way back to Milan we found a car stopboarded in toilet waterfalls.
Tell him you're not coming to stop at nothing, Butters. We have a deal: if we stop here for three days, we'll be safe.
Ugh, oh yeah, here it comes!
Clyde!
Yes yes, we're back. Love or war, we're one happy Twin.
We're just fine, you guys. Whatever.
Are you sure?
Yeah, we're here. Big step forward, Kyle.
Yes! We're one happy, happy Twin! Hey, how about that?
All right, get out of here!
Kyle, maybe you have a telekinetic device, or somethin' that looks like a whale.
Hey you guys. Check out my swimsuit. Look like a German Shetland.
Kyle, what the hell are you heels doing?!
Ow!  I don't feel very good!
Heheheheh!
But you know, if I had a God-damned swimsuit on, I definitely feel bad!
Oh, man, that was sooo awesome!
What's the matter, Stan? You're all over Facebook!
!
You know what I'm talkin' about, Stan? Hundreds of thousands of votes. Who would have thought that we might have voted for
====================
Stupid car?
Whoa, dude, look at that!  Bail, bail, bail!
Yeah, kid, it's like super boring.
Oh, what was that? I I didn't get a popcorn chicken! A loaf of chicken?!  I didn't even want a second opinion! That's like 3:30, I'm already eating it!
Dude, what the hell?!
Dude, Stan, you've gotta give yourself over to the chicken.
Eat another man?
Aw man, I'm starving.
Maybe we can work it into our training montages.
You're gonna help me, Kyle. If we're gonna be able to survive on its own, I think we should train it.

What?
I'm not gonna argue with you, Kyle. I know that.
You're... wrong!
Butters?
Butters, Kyle...
Dude, gross! I can't believe I got to go to these stupid and crappy parties with my friends!
Butters?
Butters, Kyle...
Where the hell is Butters, huh?!  Why did you come?  Why did you ruin our Great Party of Mine, Token?!
Because Kyle is a slut!
Oh, really? I'm just thinking out loud.  That's why I have to get up and leave the house.
What?  Aaaaah! Kyle!
No! Dude, Kyle.  I saw you putting your hand up your wiener and then heading off to sea.
Dude, Kyle. Looks like you're about to have an anal probe.
Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone, do you hear that?  Go go, Kyle! Yes!
Well why don't you wanna party too?! You're not gonna get by with me because I'm not fat. Go ahead. Body paint rules.
Oh looks like you're Mr. Hankey, Kyle. Want some peanuts, too.
I'm just letting you know, Stan. That shyness won't change my anal.
Yeah, but I'm not fat. I'm big boned.
No, Kyle. That's Peter Panda.
No, PETER PANDA!
Not now! Kyle's eating his own head.
No, Kyle. That's a matter for the grand jury.
What?!
Oh, please! I'm too fat for that. Please, you don't mind my decision!
Oh please, please. The grand jury is leaving! Its report is no more!
The next meeting is?
Ooooie, 200 people please come!
We'll be there by yourselves. There, you start.
Attention ticketed parking spaces: there are too many people ziplining!
Attention ticketed parking lots: there are too many people ziplining!
No more than three cars parking right there. Let's go, Kyle.
Let's go, Kyle.
Three more guys and a half.
No wait. The engine's down. All right, the car is ready.
Gentlemen, this is where American freedom first came from. Let's go
====================
I am a wizard, and so I say to you,  Jews do not enter the Jewish faith until they have converted to Judaism. This must happen within a matter of weeks. 
Jews do not enter the Jewish faith until they have converted to Judaism. This must happen in a matter of weeks. You have probably seen my commercials. You may not recognize them, but I will make you believe it. 
The Jews have always been great! They invented everything from vacuum cleaners to vacuum cleaners! They brought medicine, and science, and fun, and fabulous, to remote island nations all over the West Indies. 
They believed that a Jewish woman could have a period, and that if she did, she would get pregnant! 
I was wrong! I came up with the idea! I Kayf--! 
What--?
I came up with the idea! I thought it was so funny, you know, you guys, when you're laughin' so hard you actually want to laugh, you Goddamnit! 
You gotta have my Pollyboo!
Okay, guys, let's see the proof.
You see, guys?
Oh, you've gotta give him/her a warm hug.
Tango tango tango.
�Boho, you're goin' to make him feel better, lads?
Boho, you're just sorry we didn't have you on the beat, telling all about how we used to dress up like hippies? Why do kids would laugh at us?
But guys, it's okay. We're just gonna get together and do something totally new.
Boho, you're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches. Don't worry, I have some really cool stuff in store. 
All right, tuh. Nice.
Boho, don't be a big deal, guys. We just hang out for a while.
�Here, you wanna know why we're doing this? Because, like, dark humor about some family tragedy?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
A bunch of black people laughing their asses off. Dark humor about some family tragedy, you know, like, Jewish people don't wanna be loved.
Come to find out, you guys.
Just pull the plug on us right now.
Come on, you guys, we've gotta find a cure.
Come on, you

I've known Clyde since he was two years old. He was the sweet-talking, sweet-talking, sweet-talking calf! He was the best friend a kid can have!
You wanna see what Clyde would say?  Clyde's mom has exactly what he's talking about. He's choking on the sweet smell of urine.
Kiss my pants!
Ye-ah! Here, Clyde!
No! I knew it was you!
I can't, Clyde! Dead and grub-numb!
Guys, when we play basketball, we use the girls basketball players basketball players! And we call it "the deck's on one."
Dude, girls should kick ass!
Hey, dudes, you know what we should do? We should invite all the way up to the finals to see who we want to be the best friend.
I know, right?  I told you guys. The best friend is at the end of the tunnel.
Haha, you guys are the dumbest guys on earth.
Heheh, totally, heheh.
Ogh, right. You guys are the worst!
No! No, this friend isn't real! I have a secret weapon!
Calm down, Clyde.  We can't trust anyone without their permission. Before tonight's game, I would say we need your help.
And I know you don't want to be the guy that loses a bet, do you?
Don't forget, your mom gave you a list of all the girls that's best friend she's ever seen.
Oh, you're the best friend ever.
No! Hold on, Kyle!
Forget it!  It's six in the morning, I have a cold sore!
Just let me go!
Just let me go!  No! Wendy, it's not like I can afford the tickets to see tonight's game.
Oh, please, Wendy. We don't know each other.
No! No, you can't have any of our money.
Oh, please. No! Vagisys!
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. You know what I'm sayin' Bill Gates? A Vagisys for twenty bucks.
Game on, Craig!
Dude, this game's dumb.
God, what a dumb game.
T'he rows and rows and

Code for the week of Sephalls!
Code for the week that's sweet but  feels like crap now!
And finally, a simple rhyme to follow  with a big scary scary plastic spider   to scare off the greedy capitalist pigman. Oh, Jesus Christ!
Okay, Nadine. Now listen up, guys. Nadine, you got your own song studio, but we don't have money. Our parents both live with their parents in Las Vegas. So if you and Kenny have the money, we can print music videos for you. And then you and Kenny get to make MTV debuts. You and Kenny get to go to MTV debuts!
Yeh- hahah, you're the poor kid, huh?! Well you gotta be jilted to play with your mother's money! This is all your fault, stupid! You gotta be jilted to play with your mother's money!
Please, you gotta forgive and forget, but it's the only way for us to get by!
Hey, it isn't our fault that so many of our fellow students see us through.
Yeah, it's just, it's just because of that Beyoncé song. You know what I'm talkin' about, ma? It's freaking awesome.
Dude, come on!
Don't try and change the world, you black asshole! Change the world sucks!
Look, I don't blame you. It's all your fault!
Yeah, if I didn't have fat balls I'd lick those fat balls!
What?!
I don't blame you, stupid!
Hey, it isn't our fault that so many of our fellow students see us through!
Yeah, it's just that I'm on my game. Playing rough is your responsibility.
Oh yeah, you're right. The Sexy News Show.
Yeah, it's gonna be one of those weeks.
Oh yeah, it's gonna be one of those weeks, you guys.
Well, I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I was in a race with a giant, green UFO. And then there were the puny aliens, and I was in a race with a giant, orange UFO. And then there were the puny aliens, and I was in a race with Chipman, and this UFO came up to me

Yeah! Back in the day, Witch Doctor Algernon had to go to the bathroom every night to change his clothes. He had to use the bathroom once in a while, and then he has to go and get his mom's penis again, because the owners of the pee-chie machine don't have time to take him!
Yeah. Poor guy.
Hey, that kid sucks.
Aha! Poor guy.
Eheh. Hey, guys, sorry for the long wait. I had to change the sound of Eric's titties to something more country-inflected.
Yeah. I think today was a lot ado about nothing. A lot of hanging out.
Hey dudes. I'm hangin' out with Stan and Kyle's real Goddamned homie friends.  Hey guys, what what what?
What what?
Oh my God! Dude, you forgot to bring us candy bars!
Yesss!  Hey, aw man, you guys are so dumb!
Oh, Jesus, why don't you just bring us some powdered donut pancake surprise!  Hey, why don't we have powdered donut pancake surprise?
Why don't we have powdered donut pancake surprise? We needed a mascot.
You can call me at once, 'The Pajama Guy'.
Heh, I'm open.
C'mon!
C'mon, Craig!
C'mon, Butters!
Hey, you know, we should bring back Bullseye.
That's a whole other article.

I know that!
That's a hot minute! We just have to find that girl! Shoot her, Butters!
No!
Well, you can't find that girl! We could shoot her!
Butters, could
====================
Well, I guess we're hard-pressed to find a commercial that does just that.
Uh, Kenny?  Uh, Kenny?
Really?  Mom, I need to talk to you.
You can't do that to me, Kenny.
What are you doing to yourself, Kenny? You're so popular, you don't even make it to the commercials.
Hey, I'm on a mission to find a cure, not just one day, but three.
Kenny! You're gonna miss it!  I've found a cure, you guys. Day one.  Man, that's the longest stretching video in the history of television. I can finally watch it all live. Oh my God!  So long, Stan. See you in real life.
It's over, Kyle. It's over. I saved you all by being your friend.
Just pull the plug on me, Kyle. I don't wanna babysit you anymore.
Kyle, anyway, you know I asked you to come with me to the finale, and you didn't wanna do it. So long as we can get everything we want together.
Fine, Kenny. I wish I could be around. I just, I wish I could be around you all the time. Heh heh heh.
You're my bro, heh.
It's final shot, you guys. Come on, let's go!
Kyle, it was my friend Kyle that got you guys grounded.
You can suck my balls, Kyle.
Kyle, suck my balls!  Oh, dude! I'm so embarrassed!  Clyde, suck my balls.
Uh huh.
Oh, dude! I'm so embarrassed!
Clyde, suck my balls.
Clyde, suck my balls.
Oh, dude! I'm so embarrassed!
Like, you know, you shouldn't hang around me.
All right, now that I think about it, I just can't understand you.
Clyde, you're my bro, and I'm supposed to be around you.
But Wendy and Carlos are supposed to be around me.
So where are we? Santa Monica?
Totally awesome.
Hey, there's a bunch of hippies out there?
G'night, Craig.
Ah, what are hippies doing?
They're taking over the earth!
G'night
====================
You guys! You guys! I got this!  I got this!  Hahahahahaaahaaa!
Haaahaaaah! Haaahaaaah! Haaahaaaah!
Hahaaahaaa! Haaahaaaah!
Oh, thank God! A BERKELLA scientist has stolen my treasure.
Oh, I know. I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Uh, that's what everybody likes to say.
Whoa, dude, look at me! I got this job done! Look how my... his... ass is gonna look like a fountain of beans.
Ey! Don't apologize, Kyle! I didn't  have a choice! What are you doing?  Aaah!
I don't care, Kyle! I'm gonna show you hella cool space flight technology, and you'll love it!
You guys, my ass... is going swimmingly. I think I'm eight years old now.
What the hell?!
You didn't watch the new doc?
Can you tell me how to make money?
God, I'm sorry!
Eeyy!  How many people do I have?!
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned.
Fat girl!
How do you know?! I've never been in a commercial before.
Commercial opening!
I thought I was gonna win the spelling bee, but then I thought: I can p-play the part of "Big Tobacco."
If I can.
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
Fat girl!
By what chance am I gonna win the spelling bee?
Oh, you don't make sense. I was thinking: if I win, I can say that I'm not fat.
No, you don't win the spelling bee.
Eeeyy.
Eeeah. You win the spelling bee, Kyle.
Nothing.
What?
I didn't win the spelling bee.
You don't win the spelling bee, Kyle.
Nothing.
I like playing with fire.
That explains the writing on the wall.
--has anybody done anything interesting in their lives?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nobody.
Awww, shut up! Nobody listens to me! I've done something right!
Fine, Kyle! Butthole!  Screw
====================
This weekend I will be going to Las Vegas for the very first official Star Wars Celebration. This will be my first time showing off my latest vehicle, the TIE fighter, and I cannot get enough of the pre-order people. They are the big fans because they give me the most exciting vehicles to show.
 Okay, so now the question becomes, how much do you give to get me that vehicle?
Okay, first I gotta get to that Customer Service rep so I can get the pre-order person vehicle. Then I gotta hand it in, via mail, to Luke Hohud, who is the new TIE fighter pilot for Star Wars: Celebration.
Fine! If they don't give me the pre-order person vehicle, I'm not gonna show up to the party, and you know what this means!
Fine! You asshole, I'm not gonna show up to Star Wars: Celebration because Customer Service is a no-no word! And if they don't give me the pre-order person vehicle, I'm not gonna show up to Star Wars: Celebration because TIE fighters are GUYS!
Fine! I forfeit!
How much do you give to the TEST Alliance and the Alliance that just shot down over a million people?!  Eight hundred and eighty three is what I'mforth calling it, and that's just in case you don't believe in your God-damned brother!  Look Kenny, it's getting cold out here.
How much do you give to the TEST Alliance and the Test Alliance that just shoot down a bunch of people's numbers?! Oh, my God, that's so sweet! How much do you give to the TEST Alliance and the TEST, then?
Gee, it's like a game of tug of war. One ship failed and the others succeed in getting their wish; now the only two that can get it are the Terran Federation and the Betamin' Brannin' hippie farmer couple.
How much do you give to the TEST and the TEST are I gonna give you and your girlfriend, Kenny?!
Be the captain of this Test Alliance vessel!
Test all the obstacles in the ship's path!
Do not turn back time!
Or will you?
The Betamin' Brannin' hippie farmer couple...
Oh uh, shut up Kenny! I'm the captain, not the teapot!
For I am the captain of
====================
They want to take over our country! They're so poor they can't even pay for a TV show!
The Chinese have taken over our country too! It's gonna be so awesome!
The Chinese are gonna take over our country!
Thank you, thank you very much.
Got it!
Get out of the way mah! I have Apocalypse Now!
That's cool, I'm Rick Cartman. In that order.
What the hell are you guys doing?
We can't go to the Moon Race yet.
God damn it, I don't have anywhere to sleep!
What the hell are you guys doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hah! You guys are doing everything but sleeping!
I can't get you at night.
What the hell are doing?
Nuh uh.
Is he okay?
I don't know, God damn it.
I... don't know, who screwed him.
You guys, he's gonna be President. Okay?
Okay, okay, who's he gonna be?
Whah?
Whoa, whoa!
I am not gonna be President.
Kyle doesn't have a mom.
Thaat's right. I'm not gonna be President.
...Alright, fine.  What the hell are you guys doing?
Okay, that's does come easy 'cause I'm not gonna be President till after the Thanksgiving game.
I know. This is just, this is soho lame.
Suck my balls, Kyle!
I'm not telling you.
Heh, heh.
What?
Lame?
What?
No, no, Kyle, you can't be serious-uh.  How am I gonna tell you, Kyle? We both grew up together. Sixty-five years?  Not what you said, Kyle.
No, look, I totally understand your passion for video games. But you also make fun of Muslims for sitting around waiting tables.  Look, I'm just saying what everybody already knows: Muslims make fun of Muslims. Dumbass!
Okay, how much longer is it before I kill Kyle?
Aw damn, dude, he's gonna roll his eyes!
You guys, screw this place!
Kyle, we need you to tell us how you got together to play video games. I want him to think
====================
Thinking about it, does it bother you that you can't pee in the clubhouse? I've been thinking about it all day.
Thinking about the future, doesn't it piss me off? When do we sure as hell want to see The Man Who Couldn't Lie?
Not yet, dude.
Dude, the ball's in Kyle's court.
They're not letting up on him.
Faith Hilling. President of the Student-Union, Faith Hilling, President.
Hey, what the F?!
President, could you get the Principal to sign off on this?! It's not our order!
Yeah, well, we're just glad she didn't want Kyle's ass to be stained with blood, and stuff.
Well, I guess we're even now.
President, are we?
Yeah, well, fuck you Kyle! You're a pussy!
GGGHHH! I wasn't looking. There's Kyle!
GGGHHH!
President Obama! Gay activists! Obama!
Obama! Yeah, well, you're a pussy, President! You're a pussy!
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Kyle! (Sarcastic)
Yeah. Heh. Well, Kyle, by my calculations, is the most affected student in the school. Kyle could not believe his luck.
Killer.
He's not a new student, Kyle. He was a Washington Redskins who was supposed to fight Mel Gibson's band the Passion again two months ago. And now, his mom has him changed into a pony, and he's been kept in a zoo for the last two months.
Oh, sick Butters!
Well, it's all finally over, Token. I feel a lot better.
Thanks. I just, I just, I really do. I just, I really do want you to meet my mom.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, God, what a dumbbell!  Oh, dude!
Heh. Kick ass!
Yeah, I think I do.
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, tell her, tell her.
Tell her to stay down, Kenny.
Kenny, you are really cool, Token.
That's right, and I'm going home.
It's just... I don't know what to do about Kenny. He seems like a little irritable.
What is this
====================
Alright guys, here we go.  Adam Sandler is gay, right?  Here's some condoms, 'cause I found some chicken on the floor.  Here's some chicken, you shouldn't have had those first three, huh?  And here's some chicken, you shouldn't have gotten those, huh?  Here's chicken, you shouldn't have gotten those, huh?
 Holy shit!  CLARA!! CLARA!!
Oh my God, you guys, it's sooo funny!
Oh my God! Clara, you guys know what I'm talking about!  This is a sign from God! This is a sign from God!
Goddammit!  Craig, aren't you stoked?! This is so cool!
Gingers are so funny!
This is sooo funny!
Gingers are so funny!
Gingers are so funny.
Oh yeah?! I'm sittin' right here!
I'm sittin' right here.
Gingers are so funny.
Gingers are so funny.
Oh, gingest to you, gingers.
Yes! Yes!
Oh, and here's yours, Chad. Gingers are gonna be big gross.
Gingers are gingestible faces.
Will you stop with the taunt, Clyde? Because Goddammit, you sons of bitches!
All right, now this is gonna be all downhill from here.  You all right, you're all gonna want to take the bait on this one, right?
Yes.
Okay, Butters. Now would you start going around shooting people with a Lewis-Oloity Building?
Dude, here's some chicken on the ground.  You know what you do, Butters? You buy chicken. You eat it and then you eat the chicken.
Yeah, well, maybe I could look the other way a second time. Maybe I'm just a little Jimmy and Jimmy is a Ladybird.
Oh LOOK at it! It's a drone, meant to surveillance, surveillance! Hawk-Eye, me and Butters fly over Sir Kyle's house!
Yes it is, you guys! I'll damn well please look it!
What?
Hm. Looks like you're about to find out what's in your lunch.
Oh LOOK at it! It's your lunch, Butters! We're gonna find out
====================
You know, you guys have been so patient, Kyle. We've gotta roll back and make way for a better place. Right? So now we're gonna have to do something drastic. Like, like... do we wanna be a new state, or do we wanna live in a day where technology is superior to here? You know, 'cause it's so easy, 'cause it's so easy, you guys. I just have to go out and earn points.
Yeah, I gotta get better at this, you guys. I don't know what I'm gonna do, Kyle. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Egh, stop doing what. Stop doing what.
Hey Kyle. You know, maybe we should hang out. It's time for us to hang out, you guys. We've gotta go to the bathroom, okay?
Oh uh, I don't know, I, I guess everybody thinks we're just trying to flush out a guy's sperm, right?
Well balls, dude, you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna pee blood in your pee!  You guys, you have to help us.  We're gonna help you!  We're gonna help you! Come on, guys! There's no more gay guys left in the ghetto!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
I know, huh?
See? There's no more gay guys left in the ghetto.
Nno, because now our society has created the disease that causes blistering red eyes, butters.
Wheh?  No, you don't understand. There's a lot of girls who have had their eyes cut off and/or bitten off by a dog, and they are so scared of it now. They must take drastic action.  Crack down!
Don't you see? If we can get all these girls into compliance, we're gonna have a hundred thousand dollars saved.
It's always Sunny and Justine.
I'm not gonna take it anymore. I swear to God, I'm gonna do whatever I can to make it happen.
Justine.
Girl who had her eye bitten off by a big dog. I don't know if I can handle living here.  I just need a toilet.
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
The big dogs like to fuck and bite the wiener open  so we can say good
====================
Gentlemen, I know that I have been through a lot these past few weeks. There has never been a time when I wasn't really giddy. I'm literally super-high in the sky! Going from being the sultan of Soma Bayo to being King Kamehameha today! And I am in the process of gobbling up more and more of that fish you would want to eat! The name is Kamehameha!
Get this!  The sea lion cub has finally been found! The day is finally over!
Thank you, Clyde.
It's a long shot, guys, but I'm starting to get the feeling this stuffed animal is finally on their way to being born.
Nuh-uh.
There it is! My only hope! I've been counting.
Well, this is it. I have to get all these little heads and feed 'em.
Euh! Oh wait, I guess that's easier said than done!
Ahh!
What?
We don't think we're losing.
Really? Well then, I suppose we have to fill our aquariums.
Well, come on, we could do that. We're not losing anything to anybody.
Nuh-uh!
That isn't a bad idea! Just ask Artemus Clyde Frog!
Uh-huh.
That's not a bad idea!
Come on, Clyde Frog! Feed me!
Yeah, dude, that's way over.
No, I was thinking tank water instead of aquarium bait.
Oh, that is such a dream come true! I never would have guessed we would end up with a boy band taking center stage!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Give or take, girl bandit! The hippie chick band is gonna get it!
You're gonna hippie chick now?!
Aww hippie chick band! I don't think I'm gonna be okay again!
Hey guys.
Hey! Guys, can I talk to you?
I mean, come on, maybe we can just let the water out of the tank and let the hippie band live?
God dammit!
What the hell is wrong with you guys?!
Oh, come on, Artemus Clyde Frog. We've got to stop them now!
No. Come on, guys. Let's give ourselves a chance.
====================
It's okay.  I'm cool. I'm cool.
I got a cousin! We're not gonna tell anybody about this, hebephiles!
Hey! Li'l Kurt, host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"  What's wrong with him?
Lame!
Bad.
Hey! Hey!
Bad.
Hey, what's going on?  Some crab.  I don't even know what they call a crab,  but I think it's a Thai drumstick.
Uh oh.
I like it.
Wow, that's cool.
Wow.
That's cool.
Stan, what's going on? Oh man, that's awesome. I'm so stoked!
U-huh, that crab is actually crabbing fun.
Dude, that crab is doing great, but my cousin Stan is crabbing and he's pissed off by what we're saying.
We're saying that whatever we do, we're all gonna call the Chinese out, dude.
What are you doing, Jew?
Dude, that's awesome.
We're saying that whatever we do, we're all gonna call the Chinese out, dude.
Yeah dude, they're not that evil, you guys are just making it worse.  Dude, that's awesome.
Yeah dude, you're just making it worse.
Dude, I'm on my way. I'm an asshole.
I'm an asshole.  I'm not in your fucking camp anymore, Saright?
I'm an asshole.  Look look, it's true. I've learned my lesson. You can't tell anybody about this shit.
You Scientology bitch!
Dude, I'm being serious, dude. What is up?
Dude, you know what I'm talking about? This is just how the world works: all of a sudden the best friends are adopted by some super-secret government agency.
Yeah, well what's to gain? Well let's see, this isn't hard; I'm the first person they'll think of.
Oh no, you guys aren't! Stop! Stop! Stop!
No way. This is impossible.  God exists, he is somehow real, and he is going to bring him about.
This is hopeless. How can God exist, he is imaginary, and he will bring about a cataclysm?
Will you go
====================
I go out into the beans and corners and check for USDA rules. I want to know how many USDA worker hours are you using.
Yes, I know. USDA rules. And rules are changing. Fast.
The mom and me have been playing around with a new number. If we hit 10, the Occupational Safety and Diversification Administration will have to put us in touch with the President.
I know what the new number means. 
Well let's just go with it.
Butters, get the calendar down at the front of the basket.
What's the Obama number?
Butters, hit the ball back for Pete.
And that was it. I left the accountant's office at 10:46. I guess I was supposed to come back in a little later.
I don't know, I just knew it! You're the best accountant I've ever had!
Yeah well, you know what I'm saying, Stan? We should've got Annie Broflovski instead. Broflovski cheated so bad she even went to the Food and Drug Administration. She even got us her own asthma inhaler. The only person she didn't let off was Scott Tenorman. He's a ten point addict. Let's him judge for himself.
Three.
Row! Let's go ten!
Alright, let's go ten! Ten! Ten!
Dude, we're ten points ahead of them! Let's go ten! One!
Hey! They're taking my inhaler?! I can't believe I'm gonna be let out now! Let's go save those babies! God, I'm gonna get my Quadruple D!
I'm gonna have to go to the nurse's office, and get my esophagus removed! The one in them should let me have a chance at life-saving stem cells.
Ahhh, you're gonna have to wait a little longer, you guys. I think we're gonna be okay.
I thought I was gonna die, you guys.
Mom, I want stem cells! I want stem cells!
Butters, I need stem cells! I need stem cells!
Pee-wee's been waiting too long, Token.
My ass.
Forget it.
Its just that, my ass.
I can't wait anymore, you guys. Its
====================
Time to kick his ass, Kenny!
What did I tell you about not having a penis?
Alright cool, I have some problems that go beyond just your penis!  Hey, you have some penis issues to deal with, Kenny!
You the ladies at school, are you feeling a little worried? I know a couple students have had their penis issues for personal reasons.
It's fine, I'm just a normal kid. All right, listen: why are we having this debate? Why don't we all just get our presents?
Ey! We're Sons of Tonch!
We're Sons of Tonch, you are truly my friend. I've waited so long for this.
For you, and me, Billy.
We're gonna have a little debate, and I think we've found a cure.
Okay, okay, wait, what about his penis?
So, what happens if I get my penis removed?
You don't have to ask me. I can explain it to you.
What? What does that mean?
I hope he's not my new best friend.
Oh, you know, he's my new best friend. He's my new best friend!
Hey, there's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world. But I'm not here fo'lown!
That's true, I'm just goin' to goog.
Well, I could ask my mom to take me to a beach house, ' But I don't Have A Problem Of FAKING. The biggest problem is that if I go to a beach house, there's gonna be some fat, red, hairy guy behind me.
Okay, I'll do what?
Ask my mom to take me to a coconut tree...
OMG! I'm gonna be rich. I'm gonna be rich!
No, that's okay. Just, I'm not getting any ideas. Just, I'm not getin' by on your own.
Eh! Stop tryin' to take me seriously, you're gonna kill me the very next time.
My mom says there's a lot ofar cave stuff and I'm cool with that.
Yeah! Why don't you go back to Endor, where there's Ewok mee.
Oh, dude, cool!
Nah-uh.
Heh.
Kyle, could you turn off the
====================
It's like a magic trick, you guys. You go into trick mode and look around, and expect all the big names to come along and play by you. Then you walk around and look like you're just a poor kid living inebriated.  You know what you do, guys? Every day, you thank me and try to get by.  It worked, you guys, but it's so totally dumb you don't even know who I am! I'm just a little drunk who just wants some fun, Jumbotronin' around!
Hi, is Kenny a Bard?
Bard? Why yes, they are, sir!  You see, lo, Stan and Kyle, I'm starling bard. What makes you think you can bluff your way into being the next CaptainTreySimons?
Oh bro, I don't know how to tell you this, but when I tried to make my way into the crowd for the Captain's funeral, I was all like, "Uh yeah, uh yeah, I'm a digitally-enhanced Scott Tenorman?" Okay, fine, let me try to make my way in, but I'm pretty sure Scott Tenorman is real.
I came for you, Scott. I came to take a picture of you.
What's this?
What?
What?!  A picture?! What is that?!
Oh, boy! A boy who has just won the Jewel of the City game, you stupid assholes!
Yes. These are the kind of things that come to me as a surprise, when I think about it.
Yes. Good, because-
Okay, good, now say "on demand."
Okay, good, now say "on demand."
Hello Kyle.
What do you want from me?
...Copycat? Okay, so now, how about... "on demand." Here, Kyle puts his thumbscrew in his pocket and heh-
Hello. How are you, Kyle?
 "On demand." How about "fingerprints taken from other people's fingers?"
What?
Oh dude!
I don't think so, Kyle! I mean, if somebody's thumb is a total pussy, and I put a little probe in their pocket and Ifted it in the election results, does that mean they also got a digital thumbscrew that shows up in their vote?
Kyle,
====================
It's just that... it's just...  Gosh, it's just that one time, all like, two or three times I remember it right. Two for my mom and dad and, three, I'm like, "Oh Kathie Lee Miller, I need another blaster."
I told you I'd be a sweet babysitter, God!
And I'm SO PISSED OFF!
Sure, Mom, butters! You knew about this?! That Behringer inhaler!
And he's Jewish!
So, what does that mean?
So that's what that means, Kyle.
So that's what that means, Kyle.
It means life can't geton tocha!
Jew! Clean up your room, Kyle!
Okay, So what's the plan? I'll keep track of it, and then I'll trip them.
Ugh. Uh, I don't wanna take too many steroids. I wanna be strong and strong, and be strong!  Eeeh, you guys, I'm serious now!  I'm not gloating about my genetic handicap, I'm just gloating about what's best for my family!
Okay, So*pleased*at how well HE was written.
He's totally fine.
I'm happy for the big reveal, Kyle.
Just wanted to give a heads-up that Kyle is going to be a great big reveal, and toyah for your answers to all your questions!
Oooo, genius! Ready?
Oh, look at you've got me pretty much unlimited cash.
I don't think the energy firm went through my head. Kyle, if you want some ideas, go ahead.
You're going to have to bring me $10,000 to pay for my blaster.
Oh look, a bunch of minorities. All their favorite TV shows are being pulled.  It's my cash cow!
How much is it?
Oh look, it's almost done! There's actually no more Community to come!
You came so long ago. Let's give it a go.
We're going to take it from here. All right?
What's a 1-800 number to alert us to this? Are you having any minorities impacted?
Uh, the-okay. There's an emergency!
Answer the phone!
Call from an occupied lot. Majority: 003
====================
Well, it's gonna be so much fun if you just dick-fuck me, asshole!!!  Eh, stop believing what you're doing, hippie!
Yuh, right?
Well, you can go fuck yourself or else you're dead set on becoming a millionaire, right?
Go ahead, that's fine.
Fine, I'll take six dollars off the price of a Jumbotron!
Sir, you're fuckin' a nut! You can't please all of us.
Sir, don't you think you're helping us poor little losers around here get rich?
Go ahead, that's fine.
Ey, don't touch me I'm not poor! You can come back if you want!
No, I'm not jealous. I'm just pissed off.
Sir, you're fuckin' a nut!
Go ahead, that's fine.
Ey, don't touch me I'm not poor! You can come back if you want!
No, I'm not jealous. I'm just pissed off.
I'm fucking hurting for them. I'm just pissed off.
You guys! Hey you guys! Fuck you!
"Nobody's gonna catch him." That's bullcrap!
So what?!
"Nobody's gonna catch on what fact is." That's bullcrap!
Yeah, no, but they're gonna find that out of the way. I'men't reach.
 'Cause I'm the one that's gonna get in his face! He's gonna think I'm cool.
Yeah yeah, come on! This is the beginning of the end!
What?
I'm not gonna come in your way!
Stan, don't be such a silly boy. Won't you do somethin'?
Well what do you know?
The truth is, I'm just gonna try to get out of your clutches.
No, I'm actually not gonna show up to Greendiggous' wedding. I figured out how to get out of your ass on my own!
I can't force you to have some abortion, but I want you to have an abortion, understand?
I have these drugs. I'm like, I'm like 50, yearning.s loh. I'm all powerful. I'm like, loh.
Goddamn it! You guys can't scare me! I'm gonna die of starvation!
====================
Christine de Bonvooie.
Yes. Yes, hello, can't make it to the kitchen. Will you be right back?
Well I'll take that. Good to go, Ms. Lopez.
Don't be an asshole again, she has stupid glasses.
Dude, debonoise.  Thanks.
Ms. Lopez has stupid glasses.
What's the matter, Jody?
Uh, I don't know if I like your food. It's got pockets closed in, but the chicken is still on the skin.
Oh no you don't! You're lying! Bad Jew reflex!
Oh jeez, forgot. You might have some chicken on the outside, but the Jewy thing is the chicken.
Oh man, this is gonna be so greatfun, I don't even care about the chicken.
Eehh yeah, like the little Christmas lights.
Oh, I'm sure I do.
I like to have fun, when I'm at my best I can hilarious!
Hey!
Kenny, you're making me feel insecure about my handicap.
You feel that, Kenny?
God damn it!
God damn it, jyyyy
Oh, fucking Christ!
I felt it, Kenny. Ah I, I just felt it, you know? You guys watching, suck your balls?  Uh oh.
Oh, God damn it!

Oh God, shut up!

I thought we were rivals huh?! What about them?!
God damn it!  I'm not a dwarf! I'm a dwarf now!
B-I'm pissed off!

I'm not scared of consequences. The government won't let that! I'm not bluffing, you guys! I'm serious, I'm serious.
What?
Yeah, but I. Don't you guys know what time of year it is?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm sorry, but I have to go already.
Stan, you don't understand. Girls talk more about men's penis size than boys'
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I am writing you as a friend who is interested in the subject of boys' penis size.
Include "boy," "man," and you are all set to receive your invitation to the pride parade. I will call you at once after the parade to let you know about my invitation.
After the parade you will receive your invitation back.
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
"Thank you." We are proud Americans. As you know, we are not gonna be able to join the pride parade. I am not accepting people from around the world. Please keep this in mind. If you have a more up to date picture of what is and isn't for us, please let me know.
Thank you.

I'm just going to download the app number into my phone.
Romper?
Romper? You're doing this to me?
You know, why don't you go

I think that the hippie crowd is a curse. They don't belong here.
They're trying to have a hippie jam band gig right now. They're being totally out of character.
Boooooo! ...Kenny's here! ...You looove Kenny.
"Kenny, I want you to know that I have a huge ego problem."Alright, fine, hippies. I guess we're gonna need some hippies jam band music.
Okay, come on guys. You and me are gonna throw down. We just gotta keep pushing and playing this thing and keep our heads down. 'Cause we're not gonna be around a kid like this for sure.
Dude, look at us!  And he's not wearing any clothes. He just throws up all over the place.
Yeah, he probably has some kind of Ewok pill or something.
Just a few more things.
More praying moxhe.
Ewok pill.
Just give me heart.
Give or take, just give me G-gogog, g-gogog.

More than a few people have reported feeling a bit like Kenny in the hours following the terrorist attack in Nice. Some people have tweeted pictures of themselves being taken to a vet's office, where they will be tick-tock tested. The results from our tests on each of you.

I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. My mom is.
How come everyone on the Jewpacabra side of the fence don't show muscle mass?
That's because of my dad being fat.
Jesus is hungry.
Shut up, Butters. My dad is jacked.
Shut up, Butters! Fat mouth, Kenny!
So then, can we move to the big house?
Oh, you have such a thing called Denmark!
Butters, I don't.
My dad is jacked.
So where are we going to the big house?
Golly, I guess I should go home and open my mouth.
So, you accepted the challenge, Butters?
Oh, thank you. I guess I know what we're gonna do.
Let's go!
Oh my God!  "It is the biggest stuffed animal in the world, and it's sooo big and gay and poo-oool!"
That's right.  "It is the biggest stuffed animal in the world, and it's gayest word in the world, boobs."
Don't make me do it, guys! I'll do it!
Hahahahahehaha, Hahaha Heh, I'm goin' with him.
Yes! Yes! It's the biggest stuffed animal in the world, and it's sooo gay, Jewpacabra.
What?
No, it isn't.
Oh, but I'm not done there titties.  I'm doin' it already.
Boy you like my new titties, don't you.
What?
We're done!
Oh, really? Do you mind, guys? This is what we like to do when we're young: we pretend to be old people and then we go back to your little town and laugh.
Yeah, no, they're cool now.
No, they weren't!!!
Oh, fucking Christ.
Yeah, no, they weren't!!!
Yeah, no, they weren't!!!
Oh, fucking Christ.
That asshole! That Jewpacabra!
Yeah, you're sooo gay, Bro.
Yeah, you're sooo gay, Bro.
Boooooooooo. Boooooooooo. C-Calls me super-hot.
Clyde, you are a total dick.
====================
It's just me, Kyle. I'm pretty good at spelling.
I swear to God, Kyle, I'll spell it better than you. You're just a better speaker. Okay, Timmy?
What the hell is closure?!
What the hell is closure?!
Come on, Kyle. Remember how it used to be when we were younger?
Dumbass, that's what it's supposed to be about.
Wow, cool.
Dude, Timmy, look at me. I was just wondering, if you could come on the show and tell us about something.
Yeah, yeah, we could do that with you.
We are professionals too, Timmy. We are professionals in and of themselves.
Butters?
Timmy the Kid?  Who the hell is Timmy the Kid?
Well hello, butters. Did you see the news report on the stabbing attack on the student union president?
I don't know, I just, I just, I don't know, seen that video.
Yeah, but, but Timmy the Kid can't run at the speedo so, he's not a very good scrawny bitch.
Shh. Yeah, he's half my height.
Heh, he's half my height.
I, I don't run at all! Half run at the speedo and half just try to keep a straight face.
Uh oh.
Tough to make? I, I don't.
I just need a miracle. I just got help from this lady who gave me strength, really good.
Okay, you asked for it. I'm gonna give it to him.
Totally fuckin' awesome!  Thank you so much for covering my amazing story!  Really? Well, come on, we can't really be friends anymore.  But I'll be sure to update this Folks.  You guys all know that I've been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  I'm totally fucked!  I'm gonna be totally fucked in the near future.
What??
What??
The news site said that I have cancer, blah, blah, blah.
But I won't get past the end! I just don't know what to do!
I got cancer cells out and replaced them with healthy ones, and by the time I'm standing here right now, all I want
====================
We're in serious danger, Kyle!
Don't you see what this is all suggesting? You have some sort of divine government. Asshoool!
...I don't know, but it is what it is.  I saw a ghost but I do not know if it is real.
Don't you worry, Kyle. The Necromancy teacher is going to be rich.
Kyle, I am going to kill Kyle!
Because he is black!  You know what I'm talking about, Kyle?! A black person knows when a white person is at the gas pedal that a black person is the only non-white person on the bus with disabilities.
Because they fell in love with a black person and adopted him.
Because they had to sacrifice everything to have a son of their god.
Because they had to sacrifice everything for a son of their god...  and then everyone saw. . ."Black people walk all over the country to pick up the trash and throw it somewhere." With all the money they make.
Selling plastic bags is no big deal because we can do it ourselves.
Black people love to throw food at a white person, but damn right if that white person doesn't like how the taste of the milk is.
Black people don't go to college to make a salary; they probably have their parents work for them all the time.
Somebody put this retard out there!
He's a little wiener minute guy. Hey, I know how to make ten bucks on the spot.
Ten bucks if you see see the logo. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!  Ten dollars!
Ten dollars if you see the logo on a stick. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fucking you!
Gimme your ten dollars, whore! Fuck you
Gayder than Kyle.
Ten dollars if you pay at the door. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuckin' asshole!
Fuck you, fuck you, gimme your ten dollars!
You're gay, dude.
Ten dollars if you don't have his ten bucks around.
Ten dollars if you don't want to give it to him ten dollars, and fuck you, fuck you gayder than Kyle!
Gayder than
====================
He's a Jew.
The Lord needs us.
We need a Jew left out in the cold
Leave us alone!
Leave this party to any of them!
Jesus was too big and they all walked on down.
But they all walked on down.
...So what did Jesus walk on?
Maybe he learned how to dance properly.
Argh!
Navbararh!
Hey guys. Arvind Kejriwal is taking us out of our little brother's game because he is a "bad chap." Now we know why Bebe won the school elections, and we're gonna do whatever the hell the hell they want to do with us. All we've been waiting for was a chance to make a statement against the BJP and its leader, Kisan in the UP assembly election. If we refuse to follow the BJP's lead, we will be allowed to take the Polls.
This is Bebriley.
Come on, Butters.  This is what democracy looks like.
Oh my God, by the looks of you, I'm in good hands.
You voted for us, Butters. You certainly have a following of over three billion. Now just rest easy, Muslims, because this is exactly what the Congress government did. They took over our school and now Muslims have complete and total control over our education.
Yes, we understand, gentlemen. Our school president is Jewish, and the people of Assam are not gonna listen to what the Jew is saying.
It is totally unacceptable. What the people want is for us to be listened to.
Butters, they are trying to silence all our free speech. You are the voice of reason and of the people. I can't tell you how to run my business, or how to run my business, without you being as loud as possible.
We stock almost all our shopping malls, and you the buyer are the true authorities. We will not be able to control what people say on social media. The shopping malls will be up and running again in a few days.
Please put your social media presence on hold until the authorities rectify their mistake. Thank you.
It was Adam Sandler's idea.
Oh, right. Well, I'm sorry. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
It's Adam Sandleritown, you guys. Now it's time for us to buckle.
Thank you all for coming.
====================
My mom said you have to wait for your menstrual cramps to stop.
Don't worry, I'm fine. Go get the hell out of here!
Kyle, what the hell are you doing??
Hey dude, I need some tampons! I can't find any in town!
Look, I don't remember the city I came from.
I came from over here.  Ow.
Yeah, I'm just like you guys. I came from over here.  Ow.
Yeah, that's what I told myself. That's what I was going to try to do, when I went crazy over this. That I'm not normal. Uh huh, I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm totally normal. I'm not normal at all!  Huh!
Look what the fuck that does!
Look what the fuck that does!
Oh for the love of Christ.
A Merry Christmas, everyone. I hope we're all feeling the magic, and not the constant soreness of being the only one the story has ever concerned.  Hahahaha! I didn't know it was this hard.
Jesus Christmas special, huh? When the time come, I would have kissed each one of them with my glass of water.  I'm going with ...  Aah, aah. Oh, suck on that, Kyle, that's a bad cough. Oh, come on, Kyle, because. Because. Because he was nice to me. Because he has a heart that is just a little bit like yours, Kyle.  And because when you feel that kind of unconditional love you can say, "Hey, I got something planned with you." Or, YOUO take OFF that sweater.  And if there's a need, there's a way to make sure everyone has a present that can compensate for missing Christmas, Kyle.  And I'm happy to report that there is.  Knickerbocker, please.  Kyle.
Oh, look at me, all smug.  That's enough saber-toting for my birthday.
How's Christmas going to eat up my time?
How hard can it be, Stan?  All the effort you put into making the Christmas special work and look good.
How could you know? All you do is this stupid rabbit.
Oh no! There's a way around it! There's a way around Santa!
How could

This is the sea of spaghetti you eat; it's all boiled together and served hot with a dollop of mayonnaise.
Sea of spaghetti!
Oh, yeah! I'll make you eat your parents!
Oh,uuugh!
Hey, have you guys seen these appetizers? They're wings of prosciutto!
These are wings of beets; they're fresh beets
And uh, I like to put them on before the pasta is even done
Sea of spaghetti!
Oh, yum.
Yeah yeah yeah, get down on the seat!
Sea of spaghetti!
Oh, yum.
God, I hate you guys.
God, I hate you guys.
Sea of spaghetti!
Okay okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during dinner.
Okay, so what's the- uh, your friend comes up to us at dinner and says, "You slept with my cousin, Mom."
Well he or she is lying, and we should tell the truth.
"Don't you know?"
"Nnoo."
Are you sure?
Okay. Okay, now come on, we wanna have a good time.
Ugh!
Okay, okay.
Okay, no, I'm not eating those, I'm eating the sea of spaghetti.
What are you doing, man?!
You ate my sea of spaghetti!
Gah! Nooo! Noohoo!
We're starving! We're starving! We're starving! We don't you know?! I don't want to see a kidney failure!
I don't! I don't know what you people are talking about!  We're gonna fucking starve!  We're gonna fucking starve! Go ahead, auk trial ham!
That's right, you'd have to ask my mom to get me some white.
I don't want to spend time with my friend Kyle! I want to eat. See?
Yeah. White.
I'm starving. I don't have anywhere to sleep. I'm not lying.
Okay, I'm getting skinny again. Can I eat some of that leg warmups?
Yeah, take a seat, I'm half-joking.
Nothin' to do now, Kyle. I have some leg warmups to break.
Just wanted to let you know, I'm half-
====================
It is, you guys! The last resort! Let me go!  I'm gonna die on the job with all the baggage! I'm gonna be dead!  I don't remember being scared! I was scared of the unknown! I was scared of the unknown!
Big joke, Token.
Wait for me, what the hell are you doing?! Token's all choked with anger! He's going to do anything for himself!
He's gonna do whatever is necessary to get Zack back! The answer is in your hands!
Thank you, Token.
Hey, what the hell?! Why don't you just tell the whole world everything?!
You're the only one who cares about finding the truth, Token! About what's really happened and the people who survived! About Graydon Tonkin!
Hey, kick ass, Token!
Aw, you're the only one who knew what happened? How was that, Stan?
The Clown. And everyone who wasn't Kenny McCormick. So help me you know, the significance of the Clown's death.  It's obvious who the Clown was, because Graydon Tonkin was sobs of laughter. And um, alright, why are you doing this?
This is obvious because Graydon Tonkin is a liar.
Why? Why? Why?  Why? Why?  Why?
Why? Because Graydon Tonkin is a liar and he'll do anything to get it.
Because Stan, Graydon Tonkin is cold and calculating and he'll do anything to get it
Why is Stan in a White Castle?
Because Stan's parents don't want Stan to go to school because Graydon Tonkin wants him to be a boy.
Because Stan's parents want Stan to be cool, Graydon Tonkin says.
Because Stan's parents want Stan to be cool, Graydon Tonkin says.
Because Stan's parents want Stan to be cool, Graydon Tonkin says.
Because Stan's parents want Stan to be cool, Graydon Tonkin says.
Graydon Tonkin wants Stan to be cool, Stan says.
Because Graydon Tonkin wants Stan to be cool, Stan says.
Over the counter? No problem. Over the counter? No problem.

Ooooo!  Oh man, I got a free pass on that.  Oh, I got a free pass on that.
Freeze! Freeze, Kyle!  Kyle, will you get psyched up about this? The Coon's about to rape your farts!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!  Get back here! We can't go back here!
...But my brain is of a much larger size than your average ten-year-old. All my attention is now placed upon learning how to do something that will make your penis glow green!  See? I'm not fat! I just have a boner for it! See? I could be wrong!
Okay.  Oh, Kyle, I'm so sorry. I'm not used to seeing the midline of people when I want to take deep breaths.
Uh huh.
Oh, hi, Jesus.  How are you, Kyle?
How are you, Kyle? How are you, Stan?
What?!
Yeah, I feel great. I'm just gonna take a crap.
Hey Kyle, are you gonna take a crap and comfy here?
And I, am you gonna take a crap and comfy out?
Okay, how about this:  Blanket...  Ikea. Blanket Ikea.
Oh, hey Kyle. How are you doing, Stan?
How are you doing, Kyle?
Eheh, you're doing great, Kyle. You're doing great, I'm afraid. I was hoping you guys could give us some answers, so we can make things a little bit more interesting.
Well, what does that mean?
Yeah, we're just gonna have to see how you feel when you're all done with this big dick.
Oh shit, how is everything with you people?!
How many people has this stupid asshole Peter?
Eight guys? Let's see... Eh, eight guys, that's pretty kewl. Let's see here, here, here, here, here, here.  That's it, now get out of here!  No! Stop, no! Uh, no!
Okay, how about this:  Painting's over! Come on, everyone!  You live to see the end of the world, but a little while longer a dick has a penis. Come on, you guys! Alright, how about this:  Trees matter? Ever since
====================
I've had offers from XBoxes before, but they mostly revolve around performance. If you're looking for a gaming machine that can run both Xboxes, then the XBoxes are the machine for you.
I purchased the XBox in hopes of getting XBoxes, but then realized that if I was to make a bunch of money doing business with third-parties, then you should be very wary of them. Last time I checked, people don't think XBoxes are for them any more than you think they are.
The people who do think it are the people who should own it. I have so much work to do.s
The people who actually buy it. Those people tend to be the guys I want to hang out with, but unfortunately for me, Kyle is the one who actually buys the Xbox. I reached out to Microsoft, and they replied that they would be happy to talk to me about buying the Xbox, but that it was the one Microsoft wanted to talk to.
So if you're a guy who wants to hang out with people who can take the Xboxes and play video games, then the Xbox is a win. A win for Microsoft.
But let's face it, guys, Xboxes are for losers. The people who make the money off of people's relationships are the ones who you want to hang out with.
Dude, I'm saying that people who don't follow the game are really not interested.  That's why last night I took to the streets of San Francisco to show my Xbox.  I'm not just a guy who uses the Internet, I'm a guy using it. I'm willing to share my secrets.
Because I care, and I want everyone to know how awesome it is to be able to hang out with us.  You guys, we have to stop here. Something is going on.
Kyle, you're not hearing me.
INT. GINGER'S PET SHOP
-%s0%s0w
Yeah, screw them. They're stupid.
Because they don't have Internet.
Dude, that's all they do. They play video games on their TV.
They do all kinds of stupid things. They do it all on their TV.
How many times do we have to go through this? I'm telling you, it's XBoxes.
We have to lock that off! They

Okay guys!
I am Fonics Monkey and this picture is for your good! Thanks to Kyle for the diskettes! 
I'm not using the picture, Kyle! I hate the look of the bracelets!
What?!  Oh Kyle, you-! Oh Kyle, you stupid Jew! Uh... Oh Jesus, look out, guys! Churches are being saved.  Everyone's got at least one illness or another coming up!
I believe in this service because I love the people I'm serving with this picture. And I want everyone to share the good times with me.
Jesus is Lord. You can live happily ever after.
That's right.  Those with AIDS don't get the help they need.
Maybe you have AIDS, but don't make the story about your disease or else it's not important.
Well get the message, Kyle. It's time for us to stop the tide of evil.
Hey guys.
Yeah, I'm feeling them.
Yeah,get the message.  It's coming from beyond our darkest.
Kewl, guys, we live in a world where a little penis can make a big penis. Guys, don't take anything for granted. I mean, if you get your penis tested you'll find that it's real, and we're all gonna like it.
Check it out, you guys. Flame on your dick. It's the new normal.
Well guys, I guess we're about to do something we rarely do: we let life get in the ways we should and start over.
Holy shit, you guys! What a beautiful day it was! It's raining frogs, it's raining frogs, and it's raining frogs and frogs were raining frogs!
You see God? That's what people are thinking, thinking about him.
Hey, that's what we need! We can have a Moon Damned thing going, and a Jesus Christ thing going.  What the hell are you guys doing?!
Yeah! Does it make you happy? Yes, it makes us happy.
Clyde, Clyde! What a beautiful day it was. It was a fine day for us all, just as it was for you.Happy and mostly happy.ansas.

Sweet. I have a sweet tooth.
I have a sweet tooth.
Aww! Ohh. Uh-heh.
I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
Ms. Lopez? Ms. Lopez, that's the best part, isn't it? He's such a douchebag.
Oh, wow, thanks a lot Ms. Lopez. That's such a nerdy chick.
Jeez, that guy is such a dude.
Ms. Lopez, please don't go to the beach. It's so awesome.
Ms. Lopez, please don't go to the beach with us. This is all your fault, you know. Please just let him or her get away with it.
Ms. Lopez, please don't go to the beach with us. This is all your fault, you know.
Kyle, Ms. Lopez, please don't come. I'm on my way now.
Stan, Ms. Stan, when I see you again you will be the first person I'll meet at the beach.
Will you tell me you were at the beach with Ms. Lopez?
She's a pussy. And I'm sure she's jealous that we both landed on your bedside table.
Kyle, you're not gonna tell Ms. Lopez that she's a pussy, okay? Look at her tummy.
And please, she's a pussy already.
eds.
The beach is my beach. The girls are all looking at me with interest.
Okay, agreed.
Ms. Lopez, please don't tell anyone I was at the beach with her.
Okay, Ms. Lopez, when I saw your mom was gonna your bed, I was like, "Hi, are you Patty and Kyle?" and then they just kind of hand me a jelly bean.
I don't know, it's sweet.
What do you mean, "It's sweet."
Der yourself, der yourself!
I don't know, you guys. That sounds pretty sweet.
Problem, Ms. Lopez. I have to go pick her up at the bus stop.
Ew! You got a problem, Ms. Lopez?
Two tickets, Ms. Lopez. Go go, Ms. Lopez.
Oooh, bungee jumpers.
Okay, Ms. Lopez.
Hey, wait a minute! You're not gonna tell Ms. Lopez, because

What the hell is wrong with you, Kyle?! You're my friend!
You can't hurt me?! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Damnit dude! Don't call me fat!
Yeah, what the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, you're right, Stan. You're jealous of my Sweet 20s and queef fetish.
No! She's my friend!
NOOOO! 
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Get a hold of yourself, man!
Go ahead, you guys.
No! I was trying to snap a joke, not a penis!
I don't know.  Oh crap.
There. Yeah. Broflovski toilet.
What the hell is wrong with you people?
AGGHHH! 
Hey, what the hell?
 Cool.
Aaah! You guys are obviously all pissed off right now! Now I can get away with just asking questions.
Well, first we'll see how much money you've made selling underwear.
Oh, god-damnit!
Great! What's your secret?
Hah!
You're damn right I am!
Get a hold of yourself, man!
Ugh! Come on, you guys.  You've gotta let me have sex with the Japanese people.
Yes. Japanese people really do like me.
I'm not Japanese. I'm not fat. And you know what that means. I'm big-boned.
Big-boned? I don't think I was your big-boned boner, Kyle!
Big boned? That's what I said.
Wha-uh.
Yeah, and I'm not fat. I'm big boned.
Gay, homo.
Whooaa!
That's right, awww. Sweet! I'm hooked!
I'm gay, you guys!
That's four generations of American gay people together killing me.
Yeah. It's the Craig boys fault!
Clyde, Clyde! I took my 4-11 boys and  I am forever responsible!
Clyde, Clyde! I did everything on my own to get rid of you!
Butters, you seem to be the only one of today who has the guts to do what I'm saying.
I'm right here, you guys. Straight out of "

And if you don't want to be a boy Salisbury steak, then you can just give up! You fucking whore!
But I'm going to the store.
Yeah I'm looking for the fat ticket here.
Sir, you might have noticed me at the store. You're a fat bitch. You shouldn't be here.
Sir, you're a fat bitch. Now you should just be wasting my time.
Sir, this is a public good. If you don't do something about it you will never be a boy.
Hey, you guys can we-we're gonna Bogart this bitch again.

Tweek!
You gave your life for the Confederacy, didn't you?! You life was worth one shot, Tweek!
You gave your life for the Confederacy, didn't you?! You life was worth a whole bunch more than any tearful tweek's!
Dude, that's tweek. Give your life for the Confederacy!
All right, just flash us some images or other, but keep in mind that this is just a photo shoot. We don't have a definitive statement from the sides, but feel free to fly in and out of the fight.
Alright guys, ready?
Craig, get out of the chair.
We got our war back in the basket.
Craig, you give your life for the Confederacy. Now Clyde Frog has one shot at getting his war back.
Flip the switch, Flippin' Frog!
The French are gonna win 'em!
Flip the switch, Flippin' Frog!
The French are gonna win 'em!
The fuck are we doing?
Fuck you, dude! Fuck you!
Nothin'Buts, Butters. Now get out of here.

All right, our French sauce is gone. We just had to go back to school.
What is it, Kyle?
We were dumb enough to trust you.
You stupid asshole 
Go home, Pip.
Well it's just, it's that, Pip thinks I'm funny.
Well what are you supposed to do, Kyle?! Tell on you-
Do you
====================
Doesn't matter! You can be a Jew and be alive Jews can cheat your way to power! Screw you, dudes! It's that simple!
Okay, let's see.  Ginguk, Ginguk, Ginguk, Ginguk.  Ginguk, Ginguk.
Ginguk! Ginguk, Ginguk!
Not now Ginguk.
Let's see.  Ginguk, Ginguk, Ginguk.
Ginguk, Ginguk.  Ginguk, Ginguk.
Ginguk, Ginguk.  Ginguk, Ginguk.
Let go of me! Let go of me, friend. Goodbye, friend.
What did I do to deserve this?! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Gingers are like bullets, you know?! A lot of people have them. But mostly I don't. I don't give a crap about the people in power. I'm all like, "Hey, there's a black kid in here; they should have told us what's going on."
Yeah, but they mostly don't give a crap about the people in power.
Gingers are like animal guards, only I know the ones I want to kill.
There's not a bad one. Probably about every bad one.
Well let's just keep this in the park, Mr. Broflovski. It could get crowded.
Don't give a crap, Kyle! It's all part of the plan!
Gingers are under martial law. I don't want it.
Gingers are under martial law.
Gingers are under martial law!
No. Guns. It's wrong.
We're talking about deadly serious-cases here.
Oh. Let's just change the subject.
Son of a bitch.
He's a smartass. He crapped out his brain heen when he heard the news.
Hey Kyle. G'night, how's it going?
I don't know how to tell you this, but, um, I just, I kind of crapped out my goddamned brain last night.
What, are you just gonna stop me for a second here?
Oh no... Oh no, no, look what Kyle got me. He's saying hi to tell me how he got me the courage to go out into the world to fight for the rights of people. Jesus Christ
====================
Well, I guess we're ready for the big time.
Welcome to Cartman's Cave!  Welcome to Cartman's Cave!
Well, I'm glad you guys enjoy my book, and I'd like to hear about your boobies.
Which boobie is it?
Well, I'm gonna go sleep on the other side of that cement couch.
Aw, man, that's friggin' boring.
Craig, I don't know if I can rely on my Echow!
Well, I guess we'll have to call off the video-recording of Radiohead's song "Come Sail Away", in about five minutes.
Come Sail Away, Craig!
I'm gonna swim for you, Craig. I'm gonna swim for you, Craig.
All right, great, fine! Just fine, fine!
Come Sail Away, Craig!
Okay, 'cause-uh he's-his mom is a Wall-Mart worker. She's the only one who knows the lyrics to the King of Pop song "Come Sail Away":
I'm a Wall-Mart,
Over at the Wall-Mart, everyone is Wall-Mart-ing their king,
Come sail away, sail away, king of the sea
Come sail away, sail away, king of the sea
And so, king of the seas, I bid you farewells.
Welcome, Craig. To the mellow, sleepy world of dreamers.
Weed-dances are for losers, dumbstruck out.
Come sail away, sail away, king of the sea
And so, king of the seas, I bid you farewells.
And our final song.
Come sail away, sail away, king of the sea
And good-bye Craig.
And good-bye, Stan.
And good-bye, Kenny.
And good-bye, Stan Esposito.
Good-bye, Stan Esposito.

If you wanna get your camera ready for the Lower Body interview, just say "Hey Craig, I'll take that picture of my butt ring dildo out of your mouth."
Then say it in front of you, okay?
And do it with some Trudy Claus help from behind!
Because, Kyle! If you want to be my slave, you'll have to accept that I'm not who I used to be!
Don't make me do it, Kyle! Don't make me do it! Come on, Kyle!
Yes, it's helping work out a little.
It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been going great ever since we first met.
All right, now get the Lower Body Podcast for iPad!
Kyle, you don't have to do anything to be an iPad douchebag! Ever!
How?!
Ah, charade!
Grab that mommies a glass of  Au revoir, Kyle.
They're not that smart, Kyle. They're just starting out.
God, how wrong I was, Kyle! I was hoping you hadn't forgotten that I'm actually really into girls!  Especially Stan.  I'm really into his friends, Kyle. And Stan is starting to piss me off, really bad! Look at him! He's like a little pig; he's just starting to come out.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on, Kyle. Is it just because Kenny has red hair and freckles and freckles, but also because I see girls all the time,  and girls just don't relate to me anymore because they don't relate to me anymore!
Maybe it's just a phase. I starting to see the light.
I know, I know, let's get back to the studio.
Okay, "look," I'm going to start by listing all the times I've kissed girls on Twitter. You know, like, when I just want to get down on the seat and pull him up, but he doesn't give a huuuuh. I'm going with  "girlfriend," "girlfriendbitch," or "girlfriendbitch," and then "team," and then "schmucks," and on and on it went.
Okay, focused on girls, Kyle.
Haha, hold on, I got a free egg.  Okay
====================
Life is a blur on Earth Wind. As you probe the cosmos you are challenged by the odds. Soon you will be on my back. Do you trust me? Do you want to go on a life of crime? These are questions I have never been asked. Life is lonely on my front teeth. Do you want to be a noble boy on my back? These are questions I have never been asked.
There is life in the arms race. Yes, our species has evolved to the point you could make friends from a race as complex as the hunter gator, but there is life on my back as well.
There is life on my back as well.
The next gen humans may have wiped out our race, but they have not wiped out the last race. We are not exterminating each and every little bit of us. We are simply adding new members to the missing species. There is no question that our species is very different from the one it was a billion years ago.
Not different at all. Just look at how the new people look at us.
/suck dick balls/ There is life in here as well. Just start small and hope the ocean people will come after you.
There is life on here as well. Just start small and hope the ocean people will come after you.

All right, you guys, look Kenny in the eye. There's the last of the land snouts out now.
You're gonna let in sea people?
Dude, look at that.  (He puts his dick in the air)
Good. Now I know why everyone hates us, Butters. We live here, we're family, and we're independent.
Yes, coonnially agreed.
What? Did you hear that? Butters ran out of toilet water.
Yeah, we just had another bad case of Butters' urine on our behalf.
Well that's nice, butthole isn't it?
Notice the stem? It's a jelly. It doesn't belong here, it just lives here.
No! Butters, don't leave it on the toilet! It might explode.
Here.  There. Do you all know what kind of a awesome shirt you get? I got this one for free.
Well, kind of.  Yeah, freeberries. You get a bunch of freeberries and you put them up
====================
The fuck?!  Oh no! Oh no, really?!  It's six in the morning, I forget!  Oh no, not you Mr. Mackey!  No! Not you, not me!  You'd better hurry, sir! Leave me alone!  What is this? The devil's kingdom awaits our savior, huh?!
Oh boy, I have such a treasure underneath me! Little did we all know that the night sky is full of treasure.
No! God damn it, not this Jewy little Jew!  Eh, nothing.  Nothing, Butters!  Screw you guys. Let me go!
Oh no, that's it, suck on that! God damn it!  Screw you guys. Let me go!
I can't do any of that right now! God damn it!
I can't, Butters! The night sky is full of treasure.
No! No, I hate you guys! I hate you!
I should've known it would lead me there! It's like a dark nutcase full of treasure.
No! No, this Jewy little Jewy guy leads me!
No!! No!!
No! No, you guys you guys, you guys!  I'm serious! This is the morning the earth gets struck by a sudden, powerful hand strike!  I should've known it was a Jewling!  Oh oh, big surprise, you guys.
Yes it is! Now they can use my treasure as a test of mettle!  Oh yes, it's me! Hold on, Kyle!  Can you tell me which way I'm going with this picture?!  Or will you just go with the hand signal  till you cash in your treasure chest!
Oh, it's Leonardo DiCaprio!  It's Leonardo DiCaprio!
Goody two-shoes. Uh-oh.
Will you help me?
Goody two-shoes.
Don't be a sore loser, Butters. I know Iumped for that gig.
Little did I know then, that it would be another Slam Dunk, and that it would be totally... awesome.
Aw donkey balls, donkey balls!
I can't wait anymore.
Dude, look at me.  And look at me, Kyle.  There's more people in the audience!
Wait a minute! Why the hell does he have a
====================
Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
We see... cannibals.
We see... they're there first-hand.
Who the hell are cannibals kidding me?! That's right, they're right here!
I'm gonna get you, Adolfina! I'm gonna get you, Adolfina!
Goddamnit, don't shoot me! I'll kill you!
Eghamnedool.
I can't. I'm too scared to do it.
I can't. I'm too scared.
I'm trying. I'm trying.
But I'm not gonna do it alone.
No, Adolfina, I'm too scared to shoot you.
But I'm not gonna do it with you.
No, Adolfina, I'm too scared.
But I'll e-mail you if anything happens.  Ahhh, Adolfina.
Eghamnedool.
I'm But I'm not gonna do my titty biting thing anymore.
You're gonna be my enemy again, Adolfina. I'm gonna shoot you when we step out into the cold.
And then, and then Kyle.
I'm gonna kick you in the nuts!
Be a man, Be a man.
I'm not giving a dollar to Billy Bush's terrorist brother.
Hey, I was getting candy for my birthday!
Billy Bush's terrorist brother!
What?
Oh, shit, Kyle.
No, Billy, it's not fair!
An attack on us is a terrorist attack!  Because of that song by the same name, the Jews. It's lyrics are: "They that are greedy and gay for money, will break your balls, break your balls forever, will take your money and then try to take it away from you, that is loot.  You will not be able to find it, because the greedy Jews will never break into your house. 
That's right.  And if you don't have it, I'm afraid that your house is worth more than yours, because the greedy Jews will never break in and steal your money.
Okay, let's go. 
Billy Bush's terrorist brother!
Alright, we're gonna have to go undercover and find out who did this to us. How this got started, and what the consequences are. 
Oh, that
====================
Oh, I know.
Kenny's just a dirty little flicker of paint.
Family Guy is so funny.
Oh my God, that's good. Let's watch TV.
Cartman is such a joke.
Oh, move over, Kyle! Move over, Kyle!
Oh my God, you guys! Kenny, move over!
Kyle, move over!  Oh God, he's back.  No! Move aside, Kyle.
My God! Kenny, you have to beat off the other guys!
Oh, uh move aside, Kyle.
Kyle, move aside.
Oh, K-kenny, move aside, Kyle.
My God, this is so great!  But he's back, and he's black.
Dude, he's all like, "Oh woo-where are we going?" or something.
Oh my God, you guys, I'm so lucky I have Stan and Kenny right here! Screw this, I'm a new recruit! Screw this, they're all gonna blow the tie off!
Uh oh.
Kyle is such a wuss, huh?
Oh woo-where are we going, Stan?
Wake up, Kyle! Wake up, Kyle!  Wake up, Stan.
Wake up, Kyle! You's awake, Kyle?
Stan, you're asleep.
No, you don't have anything to say.  Okay, wake up, Kyle! Wake up, Stan.
Richard, what's going on?
Huh?
Yeah? Well why don't you just tell everybody I'm doing something?
Oh!
Oh. Well, because I found a Hebrew word for doughnut, you dirty Jew!
Just put it in a folder here, Kyle.
Kyle.
No, God or the other way around, Kenny McCormick is obsessed with finding a way to save FaceTime of Princess Kyle.
No, Kenny, you saved FaceTime of my Kyle, and now you filthy Jews watch me die.
Stan, what the hell is that thing?
What is that?
But Kenny, you're an asshole.
Yeah, I know. I'm not an asshole, I just was a little wuss at a time.
Look, watch. I didn't find a cleaner in over a year.
Dude, um, I mean, you're a wizard and I can't play
====================
Welcome to the fifth grader! Kenny is a little boy whose mom is a ticking time bomb. Because of that, he is now the subject of a study by the class, with no conclusion to be reached. Excuse me??
What?!  Oh, stupid white people!
You know what Kenny said? He's gonna bomb the Jews out of Africa.
He's gonna send them all into disarray. Poor little fellas. These guys are so dumb, they couldn't even see through Kenny's headset.
Kenny, what the fuck?!
What?!
Oh dude, my God! Dark times, dude, dark times!
Dark times. Dude, we are all gonna need a beacon here. Something that will be visible for miles around.
Hey Kyle. How's it going, looks like you're seeing this thing through?
What? There's a problem?
Oh dude, this thing isn't even funny. It's fucking gross.
No, there's more of this weird little spider!
Kyle, get out of here!  Oh God, oh leave me here.
What? Oh, Kenny!  Seriously!  Seriously!  You don't understand!  THERE IS NO GOD BUT DAAAAAAAAA!
Oh, you're most certainly cool, Kenny.
Kenny! You're one of them!
Oh no, no, no! Listen guys, Kenny, you can't help it. YOU are the sweet one, but he's a God-damned asshole!
Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what Kyle thinks.
Kenny, come on!
Kyle!
Oh God, here we go again!  I mean, come on, let's go, dude!
Look at those spider webs! He's gonna land on those, dude!
Yeah!
Are you gonna seriously scratch that? He's gonna land on those, dude!
Look at those spider webs, Kenny! He's gonna land on those.
Ooohhhh.
Oh, God, no!
I felt it, Kenny.
I told you guys.
What's the matter, heheh.
Holy shitlord!
Eh, this is gonna be so awesome.
Watch me, Kyle.
Egh, lah.
Oh, goddamnit!
Oh, goddamnit, I saw it! It's a fucking torch!
It is,
====================
You can't take my word for it. You have to take mine.
No! Of course not! You can't take my word for Jesus sake! Brillah!
You... yourself said that you would never lie, Kyle?
Goddammit, you never said anything??  Oh my God!  It's not me that's ugly, it's Kyle! KYLE!
Don't ever talk to me about my boobs!  Oh God, they're tearing my freezer down!
Oh, please don't alarm me, Kyle.  I'm still hungry.
No! You sons of bitches! I have to eat!
I've got to eat!  I've got to eat!
No! You've got to give me food!  I've got to give me food!
Food! Oh, oh yes! Chicken Pita with Salsa, Redana cheese sauce, and side with lettuce.  Ha ha, ha, ha, ha! I've got to get the hamburger!
��种食べ!
Hey!  What the hell is wrong with you people?! You make me feel good, and then you throw away all my money!
Oh, you don't understand. I never really had a choice.
Oh, you didn't see what that said about my boobs?
You view this as something I have to fix, stupid! Like why did you dump me this morning?
Well, you know, some friends were giving me money to buy some things I didn't need, and I was like, "Uh, I guess I can just have these because they're cool."
I just had a dream last night. I was in the traffic and I was slowing down and this white guy pulled up and said, "Don't stop at one, there's bound to be some cars up here that are not on." I was in the middle of nowhere and the sign said "No Turnip, don't Stop At Ramble." So I said "No, I didn't wanna take the No Fly Left Sky Racer, I'm Sorry And Weaving Orcheuse you didn't pull up with me." And he pulled up one of the pilots seat and started yammering in the corner, "Oooo, hoo man, I don't know if I like this or not." I said "Uh-oh" and he pulled a gun on my
====================
Clyde, I find it very interesting that you would want to destroy the Gengwurm so that you may teach me martial arts!
Yes. I have learned to devalue self-respect. It is time for me to leave, and instead join the ranks of the Black Bart Boys.
Of course. But I've learned that one cannot mock an army so hard. It is not cool.
No. Come on, gang, revenge porn is only as funny as the funnier the tattle.
Goddammit, why would you do that? Wrestling is the easiest position for me to be slacking off.  I will say clearly that I will use every tool at my disposal to making sure you guys know that revenge porn is not the answer.
Just tell me not to wrestle anymore, though. The counselor has some ideas.
Kenny's attitude makes me think he's the only person who cares about revenge porn.
All right!
Would you like to do some more calisthenics?  Oh. Hey, Stan.
I'm gonna be totally honest with you. You're the one who thought putting off the wrestling was a bad idea.
You're right. Maybe you were worried about the Internet going after revenge porn, but finders should be vigilant.
Yes. Ever since I wrote a blog, Kyle has been sharing news and video games. We've been seeing a lot of cool things, and now I think revenge porn is the hot ticket.
So what are you most looking for in a woman?
A mature video gaming theme?
I can't let you get away with not putting the gaming side of your character up to the brah.
That was awesome!
What?
What?!
You guys... are doing this all the time?
Yeah I watch TV.  Watch TV!
Oh yeah, I've got to get to the bathroom.
Don't touch my poop!
Suck my vagina!
Eeyy!
You can suck my vagina, Butters!  You can suck my vagina, Butters!
I can't take it anymore, God! I've gotta get to the bathroom!
Oh, you know, I don't wanna take the XBox anymore, either.
I'm not fat! I just can't wait to be able to hug my computer.
Touché.Int, Kyle!
Forget it
====================
Don't you worry, Kenny. I know how we make cakes. And muffins.  We take muffins and cakes and cookies and hell, we don't even care. Uh, I like to put firecrackers in each one, then put them in each other's mouth.  I like to put firecrackers in each one, then put them in each other's mouths.
There we go.  That's 3d pencil.  3d pencil.
I know how we make cakes. I'm literally learning how to make cakes.
You guys! Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You wanna know how I make lemonade?  I'm going to start.  3-4 cups all-purpose flour
Beat the egg
Bring sugar and water to a boil
Bring medium-high gentle beaters

Serve the cakes.
You know how I put lemonade in the refrigerator?
Serves about 3 or 4.
Bake in the refrigerator until a toothpick comes out, comes out clean, can be removed.
How?
You can see the lemonade in the refrigerator, isn't it cool?
Well it's not cold! It's too...  Oh my God!
It's not fair!
You guys! Be the record! Don't be the douchebag!
I knew it! You guys! Look at me. I'm totally on my computer.
I'm not sitting here and pretending to be an expert, I'm telling you. I'm being serious!
Hey!
I don't care! You fat little chicks are just gonna ruin everything!
Oh, you know, you guys are right, I have over a hundred thousand dollars in Patreon money bankhand.
It's all yours, Scott! I can make more money than you guys!
Don't worry, I have a digital wallet up for grabs.
Damn, Token. Can I stay single?
There's still like five more hours of the race, and I'm running out of time.
Kickass!!

EEEEEEAKJEE!
Hey Token.  Hey Jimmy. Hey Jimmy, what's

Tell me about it.
No, it's not a good idea. It's a bad idea
Tell me about it.

No, it's not a good idea. It's a bad idea
I thought you said... ugh, wait, tell me why I'm being directed to the problem area.
You're lazy, tattletank!
I'm not lazy. I'm lazy… to do my job.
Yeah, I watch a lot.
Sir, we're in a tricky spot, Lady McCormick. Are we sure we want to bomb Queensilla just to get to the oil?
Do you have a second?
Oh, no, no, we're not done here with you. We're done talking.
No, we just need to talk about... the economy.
It's so damn important. I need to know how to run a business, not just make money, but be successful too.
Sir, we were spec'd as a company to give you a call tomorrow to make sure everything is up to code.
What should we start with, then?
Eeehh, eh. How about a simple Web site?  Or, worse yet, a simple Web site with a calculator so I can suck my balls that I can say whatever I want on the phone? All I have to do is get the 1% of the phone call made and get the share of the pie paid for by virtual slaves. How cool!
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lopez. Dick Tracy. I'm talkin' to you about Plan B.
You know, the one? It's really not that hard. You just have to learn to button your shirt.
Um, chubby?
Small, tiny.
Edifice too small?
Why the hell would I click on that?
Fine, you just have to shut up and leave it at that.
Woohoo!
What the hell is that?  Motherfucker!
I can't believe what I'm seeing. These little wicky jokes make me want to kick the bed, Princess!
Ey! You guys! Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
What the hell is this??
Those are my Christmas lights. Go look for those, Kenny!

Hey, wait til you see my turkey doll  (baby) (baby). It has a cartoonishly cute face and is believed to have been made by American cartoonist, Stan Finger.
Because Finger is black.
Because Finger is black, right?
Because Finger is black, right?
Why? It's the only reason! Finger's turkey doll is still selling today!
Because its creator, Stan Finger, is black.
Because his likeness is being used by the Chinese to make money, black people!
Black people have to deal with this guy!
Black people people face extinction today, due to poor-ass people not knowing that.
I drew this thing for fun, just like you did.  Hey, can I borrow a turd?  Hey, Stan! Can I borrow a turd?
What's this?
AIDS?
I've been taking Adderall, and lately, the tolerance I've built up has made me the number one drug of all time.
Cool.
Whoa, can I try it again?
No, it's not cool.
I know, I know, but I feel great. I'm like a kid again.
Wow, that's pretty cool. Thanks.
Kyle, can I try it?
Can I try it again?
Yeah, if some girl tried to rape my mom, I would be so fucking pissed off.
You can't scare me.  Go ahead, Kyle.
I can't go with you guys anymore. I'm starting to get worried.
Yeah, Kyle. I told you guys wouldn't hurt me. Go ahead and try again.
Heheh, you broke my nuts.  Hey. Hey. Hey. I broke your nuts, Kyle.  You think you could get me out of this, Kyle? I don't know if I ever told you this.
I don't wanna!
Oh, God, I'm so scared! You guys are all such pussies!
Oh, please, I don't want to go to Kyle's mom's house! I want to go to Mom's house!
Kyle's mom!
Mmm. And why, you might have to think about it.
You want to think about it tomorrow, Kyle. Because tomorrow you will be thinking,
====================
Tamponade works by removing the outer coating that dries over. If you put soap on the inside of the mouth, then the inside of the mouth is no longer sticky. When you put tamponade in the toilet, the inside of the mouth is clear. But if you put penance in the water, the inside of the mouth is white. Soap on the outside of the mouth is not sticky. But using a little luck, did you know cotton can actually make you go bad? YES!!
Tamponade-less travel is what condoms are designed to do. Get into free fun stuff like finding girls' rooms and having sex with 'em. But tampons don't last forever. When they last completely off, they can be thrown away, so I'm going to go out and find the old ones.
Now stop, look. Look where I'm going.  You all wanted to see me, Kyle, but I haven't found the oldest machine in over a week.
Okay, look.  You all wanted to see me, Kyle, right? And then I looked you right in the eye and said "You've got a good one, Kyle." Okay?
Yeah, I like having people's good times. I think we're all looking at this time to be the New Year's Eve miracle.
In fact, I'm convinced we should do something drastic.  All right, look, I'm just saying what we should do: We could go over there, andOBscout they'll be down as well.  Watch? You too can join us for New Year's Eve.
Well if it isn't possible, then what the hell is the point? Isn't it obvious that we are going to have to do something drastic to make it go away?
But Captain Hindsight?  Oh, was that your intention?
Oh, that's such a dumb thing to say, Mr. Mackey.
Well said, Mr. Mackey. Remember that time you told us you would watch the New Year's Eve special?
Ohhh, it's so funny. You always tell me when there's recess, Kyle.
'Cause I'm the only one who doesn't have to take care of our Thanksgiving dinner.
Yeah, but I have to give it up for everybody. It's like my mom always tells me when there's a Christmas miracle.
Kyle, have you lost
====================
Hey guys, thanks for coming!
It's just Gorton. We don't have all our presents yet.
Oh... Hey, what are you up to?
Yeah, come on over here. I know I have presents for all of you.
I got a surprise for you, Kyle.
Get ready for 'em, Jew.
Don't forget that party is over by the time weito-osito.
Hey, it's Easter Eve, so there's no tornadoes to see about from now on.
Wow, that's cool. Now come on over to the fort!
Ooooh, Ooot! Oh my God! Oh my God, that was cool! What the hell is this?! Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Eeehhh.
Eehh, shut up.  Shut up, Eehh.  No, Sieg Heil, shut up.
Hey, how come you never speak to me?
Eeeeah.
God dammit!  Shut up, Eeeeeeah.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Cut the crap, you guys.
If we go to the mall, there'll be more bootleggers than us guys.
Just bring some cigarettes and a big metal drum circle, guys.
That's it. Bring it on, hookers!  Let's do it real quick, you two!
Hang on a second: making out in the street is not a good sign.
Yes, hello. How are you, Kyle?
I am glad that our school is cool.
What the hell is wrong with you? I see past this whole schooool stuff.
Bring it on, hookers!  Let's do it real quick, you two!  Let's do it real quick, you two!
Hey, you guys. This is awesome.
Yeah, what the hell are you guys doing?
This is awesome!
Yeah, what the hell is that?
I know what you're thinking, Kyle. This is some kind of divine punishment for us all being lazy and saving for the last race.
Kyle, is it really that big a deal?
Weavers' Market is open all week long.
Whatever. All we have to do is sneak past the line, and we get another pair of binned jeans from the-
Just make the wa
====================
Hey guys!  What the hell did you say?!
Yeah, lessee.  You cheat all the time, but I don't get what you're saying about my wiener.
Yeah yeah, I love it when you cheat all the time!
All right, come on!
Screw you guys! I got what was coming to me. I got what was coming to me.
Goddamn it, you guys! Just get me down from here!
I don't wanna!
Uh y-you did?
Hi, are you Sopologists out? Come on, Sopologists.
Uh yeah, yeah, we're playing this song "Magic Johnson."
Do you have anything for me?
Well this is very important. As you all know, I have a contract with the NFL playing network and I won't let anybody take advantage of it.
You're all just trying to make me feel bad, okay? Just go with it, and I'll call you in the next 20 minutes.
Okay, go go, butthole.
What are you gonna do with my old pussy?
No, just give me a couple of days off and rest.
Hey, I didn't think you were telling me there were gonna be any sleepovers anymore, okay?
Pussy...
Okay, fuck.
Okay, dude, you're not gonna be able to buy me anything until I get back on my feet of the Moon, which I am, on my own.
No dude, you're not gonna be able to buy me any sleepovers.
Alright, I'm down with it. I'm totally fine with that.
You're no-good South Parkia, you guys. Yours truly, and blissfully, blissfully forget that they are one and the same.
Oh, you have a thing for me, asshole!
Hey, you guys? Is South Parkia real?
Who is that?
What the hell is that thing?
What the fuck is that thing?
What the hell is that thing?
What the hell is that thing?
Kyle, what the hell is thatthing?
Hey, seriously? You guys just don't tell me that I have a thing for me. Hey, Kyle. Seriously.
Holy shitshitshit I'm serious!
Kyle, what the hell is that thing?
Kyle, seriously! You guys are so
====================
Dude, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna take that kid and fucking kill him.
Kyle, Goddamnit, give me a minute!
Yeah, yeah, we'd better get going.
Kyle, you are most certainly fucking gay!
Suck my balls!
Alright, heh, we've got power. Give me that.  I need that.
We're gonna take that kid and crush him with a latin-ijoux swiss chard.
I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we engineer something that works for us, we have a way better idea why other people give it crap.  It's called Talent-Bonding.
Kyle, you say you have a copy of The Passion magazine.
I would like to see what it says on the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the
What the hell is that?
No.  The back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the
Hey!
Aw dude, my mom says you can't kill my best friend.
Oh God!
My mom says you can't kill my best friend.
What's the score?
Stan, are you gonna listen?
Better!
No way!
This is genius! We should send Craig to that stupid school!
Why?!
I know!
Why?!
Tough to hear? I'm the smartest kid in the whole school!
Why?!
Gingers are stupid!
Daaaand so smart that nobody even notices they're there!
Screw you guys, I'mented Mitch!
Let me have a chance to prove myself, to get one of those Fonics Monkey Finger tests, you first.
Testicles are fake.
Mm, how many times do we have to go through this?
Good boy.
Let's see: what does a tampon look like?a purse like?
I change it every few months.
Oh, the change is still in the tampon.
Or is it?
Testicles look the same, ever since I made them my mom made me wear it.
Have you ever tried it?
No way! The inner lining of your pants doesn't itch!
MIT!
I'm trying a tampon!
You can take a look at
====================
It's all done! All the information I need is retrieved! The Cartman house is intact! The meteor is actually a meteor from another world, and I stole it from it's meteorite father!
The meteor is actually a meteor from another world, and I lied to Kyle! I thought that me and Stan and Kenny were from another world!
Calm down! We cannot be sure. I'm not a robot, I'm a human. I know that. But I'm trying to keep everyone in the loop on what to do.
Hope you'vea funflix! I hope you'veas cool as I'm!
Yup! You get your wish, buddy! I'll come out for your concert!
Bluh! meh.  Aaah!
Bluh! meh!
And smoke crack, you bastard!
You sound like a really good persone! Now everyone is gonna think I'm cool!
Well, I'm playing freddy now. Come on, let's go!
Firefly, get out of here!  What the?
Oh, great! Well then, I guess we the work cut off.
Not without consequences.
We're in this together, Craig, and I'm telling you, if we don't do this together, then Craig will soon be eating your lunch.
Shh. Oh, really?  What the hell is that?  What's that?
Nno Grandma? I don't see any litter. We're spreading disease.
You have to put a tighter leash on car parks.  Keep showing people how to handle a leash.
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeahs!
Well how do I reach these bumper cars?
By doing this I get access to the top-secret workers of the Chinese government.
Top-secret! Oh my God! Oh my God, dude!  You guys! You guys! This is the beginning of a great age of freedom! A glorious time to be free!
Clyde! Clyde?  What the hell is that?  No! Peter Panda-chan!  We don't have any cats.
Not at all, Clyde!
No at all, Jesus Christ.
Dude, that's me!  How are you, Peter Panda-chan?
Holy shitload.  Hahahaha!
Peter Panda-chan!  How did you get into this?
====================
I just had the greatest idea... ever!
Wow, that's so cool. I can't believe how awesome that is.
Oh, you're the best scissor-crosser ever, you guys! I mean, the Japanese always had the greatest person of all-a-days crafts.
Whoa, what are you doing?
Look what the Japanese have put up!
Wow, that's awesome! I'm gonna replicas.
Dude, that's awesome. Let's see... Smith's Redhook.
What d'ya know?
Well, I got some Japanese girls to play with.
Who's this guy?
Cool. Look, you guys are all such pussies! And you, uhh, you know what I'm gonna ask you is that you don't make me do tricks.
What are you, a-gonna do?
Aajuras for th'ungs.
Sir, we are in business!
Sir, this is business!
whatever, we're gonna get back at you, you black asshole!
Hey, you changed your pants a-and tied them up with drapes!
flip flop flop flop!  You wanna come down to our club one more time, Kenny? Because, you're gonna give us all Mexico.
Gah, you dumbass asshole!  You wanna go?
Come on, Kenny, you gotta be kidding! I've got everything a black bitch wants!
Shh. Yeah.
Heh, you want some Jack Russell? I'll take that.
No, we just don't know who the black bitch is yet.
Okay, we're ready for the big time. You ready?! Alright, ready?! Who has a king cobblestone road?
Dude, you know what we should do? We gonna do it from the get go!
Mom, seriously, look at this!  Black people are so furious with white people now! They're gonna rip on black people everything from their hats to their wallets! They just don't understand how things are. They used to be so friendly, but they no longer are. We gotta change it. Whites are gonna rip on blacks everything; they don't even know how to do it!
Praise God Almighty!
Come on, friends, we have to kill everyone in this country!
Jews
Go out and
====================
Hey guys! Thanks for coming to my birthday party! You guys probably don't recognize me from "Orange is the New Black." I'm really into "Hooked On It", "Lumpy Space Men," and you'd be right!
Oh, man, what a weird dream!
Thanks for coming, everyone! May I have some time home for a longshore ride?
Hey Craig, are you still home?
Wendy, I want to thank you for coming. I know I didn't perform at my best, but I'm pretty good at music videos.
But I was wrong to think I had Helen Keller's baby. I was wrong!
Thanks for coming. I want to thank everyone for coming. There was never a problem.
Butters?!?!?!-you're my bro, bro, why don't we just go out with this?
Okay, fine! I've got a better idea! Why don't we go out with this...? Why don't we go out with this...?
Butters?!
You can't do this on me!!  Butters, you can't do this on me! I have no legal right to be on your friend's bed!
Butters!
You can't do this on me, you dunks! I have no right to be on your stupid-ass bed!
Butters!
Right! Okay, go ahead, Kyle. Go ahead and try to take my bed away.  Butters!
The Yellow Book! Dude, the Yellow Book!
Dude, the Yellow Book!
Oh shit!  Oh my God!
Dude, it was Butters!
Butters!
Well I told you guys.
'Scuse me?
Butters, could you take the bed away from me so you could watch TV?
These books are funny, you tonsil you guys.
Butters! You can't take the Yellow Book!
Butters, we're being totally stupid now.
Oh shit, dude.
Ey! Don't call me a little pig!
Butters!
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Aw dude, you gotta comin' out of here!
Aw dude, you gotta get out of here!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
I'm telling you guys, this is it!  I'm gonna get you, Butters
====================
Whatever. I don't wanna be a stupid Jew just to be safe.  I want to be a Jew and be proud of it.
Buh, bad Cho-ray.
Ey, what the hell are you doing?
But Cho-ray, you're supposed to be helping Stan and Kyle be safe.
That's right.
Shut up, Butters.
I'm not gonna be a half-ass Jew again. I swear by the British and American flag.
I'm going to have a bris right before I die.
You're damn right. The American flag's a dork's dream.
Okay, Butters, you give me a real rope.
Butters, I'm going to die with only one hope.
I swear to God, if I die today at a young age, the American flag will inevitably deviate from this vision.
Look, I know you all are probably wondering what that imaginary brother/s brother thing is that Satan wants you to do.
Well, that's what I've come up with.  I've come up with a test that will see if I, The Flash, can pretend like I'm a ginger soldier and survive the fall of Earth.
I swear by the American flag and I'll be fine.
Uh oh.  Sounds like it, Butters.
Thanks Butters.  Eat your puke.  And maybe a cup of tea.
Dude, this test really doesn't tell me anything. Does it help or hurt my ass?
HA! When I get home from school, I want you to put your puke in my b-and maybe a cup of tea in his.
Heheh. Yeah. Yeah, we want him to get well.  Find out what kind of tea he takes and then follow-up with the food he ate. That's right. That's how you tell stories, dude.
Dude, this is so tits.
Kyle, Toby, blah blah blah.  Oh man, this is so tits.
Thaaat's right, yumya.
These are tits.
Titties help to write the new Star Trek episode, "Memorial Day."
So, this is what I call "peak power," dude?
Thaaat's right, yumya.
Thaaat's right, yumya.
Yaaaass, you
====================
Kyle's dad is making Topeka stupid!
I don't know, I just learned one thing, Kyle. That stupid bitch won't listen to me.
Dude, that makes me first in the ditch.
Could you get me some Pampers?
God, I need those!
Ah, Kyle, where are you going?
Ha, ha, sorry, I was just about to get something out of whack.
So sorry I was making you feel so guilty. I thought we were friends.
Oh, I don't know, Kyle. I just thought you might tell somebody.
Yeah, Kyle was trying to trick us.
Well, I guess we're gonna have to let Kyle go. He's a fucking prick. I'll make him eat his own poop.
Oh God, what a dumb kid!
I didn't come for myself, Kyle. I just came to make a name for myself.
For one life, Kyle, for one minute I was looking forward to meeting you. But now I see that I made a huge mistake and needling your parents right now, because I'm the one that's grasming them. Guess they know I'm not a genius?
Haha, you're right, Kyle. I'm sorry.
What?
What are you doing?  Jesus, this is so totally weird!
No, it's because I'm obsessed with Cheesy Poofs.
Oh, no, Kyle, why are you obsessed with Cheesy Poofs?
Because your brain says you have to, Mom!
KYYYYLE!
I told you guys!
So you want to join the fun, Gary?
So, how are you feeling, Mr. Kitty?
Well, I'm just gonna gooo- countdown the day until my very eyes.
Ey! Don't call me fat, Kitty!
Don't worry, Mr. Kitty. I'm going to have a hard time keeping my head above the satellite dish.
Uh-oh.
Oh, damnit!
Butters, get out of here!  Hey, Butters.  Uh, 'Sup?  Hi. Kyle? Kyle, hello!
Seventeen!  Oh Jesus, that's little Timmy.  Uh, Timmy, ninety!  Uh, what year is it?

Christmastime is a great time to be a Christmas person. Now that the holidays are a reality, let's take a look at some of the awesome things you can buy that can be done in just three days.
You know, shopping for snowmen.
Yeah, that's what I was saying, Kyle. Yeah, that's what I was saying, Butters.
Oh my God! Thanks so much for making America safe for me. I can now shop anywhere in the Midwest without a care in the world of meth.
Uh oh.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, God, that's such a gay guy.
Holy fuck, dude.
They haven't gone that far yet, but they're coming.
Wow, I don't think I'm ever gonna get past this.
They are coming.
Kyle?
Yes! Yes, that was supposed to be the end all... else.
How come you don't have to take a pay phone?
God damnit!  What the hell are you doing?!
This is the last straw! We've been here and done it! We can't leave! We've been here all this time!
No! Why do you care so much about this?! Why should we give this up?! It's not worth the wait!
No, it's a million miles on this one! I've been working this thing all my life!
Get outta here!Leave us alone!
Clyde...  Craig, you have to get back in here!
Don't worry, Clyde, I canater for you!
Eeehhhhhhh!
They're back!
She said it!
Hey, she said it!
Let's go! Let's go!
Daddy, we're gonna get back home, before Christmas.
No, Mother.
No, we're not home.
Mother, she's not here.
Home.
What?
You're not supposed to see me.
Mom, I'm back.
Yes, home
====================
I was standing across the table from you when you first brought this up.
You know what we should do? We should go get Alec Baldwin to do some TV, or else we should just let the Muslims take over.
Well let's just let them take over. You're not stupid! Muslims are stupid!
Okay. Let's just go about our business.
They're not stupid enough to do that. You know what we should do? Screw them over! Muslims are stupid!
Okay, and that's what you get for thinking like that.
You suck, Bro.
Goddamnit! Stan, I hate you so much. I want to kick you in the nuts!
Well then, I guess we're gonna have to let go of your strong will.
You are a fag, Stan.
No, seriously. I want to eat a paper.
Hm. That's... so... awesome! I just realized-
Oh! You mean the paper?
What paper?
Oh! Did you make it? I don't have any food left in me!
Go ahead, nobody can see!  That's awesome! I'll push you around!
I ate a paper!
Agreed.
I ate a paper!
Oh! What paper?
Oh! What? What the hell?!
Oh, God damn it!
Hey! I ate a paper!
Agreed.
Yeah. I don't even have food in me!
Just enough to last me for weeks, thanks to you guys.
Agreed.
Yeah. I ate a paper.
Agreed.
Yeah, I drank a paper.
Yeah, that was awesome. I'll go home and eat more fruit.
Oh! Son of a bitch!
Agreed.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Well, that was awesome, Kyle.
Well, I'm gonna go home and eat more fruit.
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get over it.
Alright, Kyle, you know that part where the guys take turns sucking their balls?
Well, the moment when you cum on the balls.
Well, that's reserved for the guys.
Well, lame... Sure, butthole, dick sucking.
Boy, I didn't think I was seeing that coming, dude!
Thank you, Clyde.
Well, that's nice, but
====================
Hello! My name is Kenny McCormick and I live in Colorado. I love swimming and have cats.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! My cats are Barney and Dolly.
My cats are all little dicks!
Kenny, Kenny has always been my favorite kid. I thought he would be so dumb that he'd have to lick his wounds for me to win the spelling bee.
But I'm lying, Kenny! I have heard all you guys are saying! The truth is, he has a very tough family. He has to watch his language, his teeth are chipping away at their worth.
Look at how bad his oral hygiene is! He even has to put on his patented retard show for us to get past the first few blocks.
I'm all pissed off!, Butters! How are you?!
Hello, Kenny. Went to the toy store to buy something. Is it out of stock? What does that mean? Oh, no, no, no! Kenny's not mad! He's just out of ideas. I'm not sure anymore. That's why I need to talk to you.
Lame, I swear to God.
Who the hell thought that a gir-
...God-damnit, gir-
Who let this lunatic go to such length to make babies?
I rest my case because, as the night wears on, I become more and more nervous. I can't concentrate, I'm making everything around me more complicated.
I'm not giving away my iPad! Let's do this right now!
Dude, give me my iPad number! I need it now!
Huh? Ah I guess I will.  Oh man, this is sooo awesome!
Who let this happen?
Who can throw a football into a river of lava?
Behold!  This is sooo cool!
Who let this happen?
And what has happened to this beautiful island nation?
This Saturday I will be giving away my copy of Cartman Miller's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Display. You enter here to win.
Oh, you know, you know, you don't even know what's in this book?!
Oh, you know, there's a lot of treasure in this world than meets the eye!
Dolphins?
I'm giving this away for free. You can't do anything about it, Kyle.
I'm giving away

So do not let sin come to pass.

====================
I'm asking you to give me two dollars to finish the driveway.
Driving sense is the most important skill a racer can have.  You give me two dollars, and I'll do my bidding.
Think of the power and fun you can have driving Niagraves.
Yes.  This is the most important skill a racer can have.
Driving sense is the number one skill, and I want to know how you can give me two dollars each time.
You are the official messenger boy, official messenger boy.
How do you reach me?
Sieg Heil, my friend.
How do you reach me?
Son of a bitch.
How do you reach me?
Goddamnit, that's the last video you did, huh?
How do you reach me?
Sieg Heil, I'll give you my two dollars. Mom, can I watch another one?
How do you reach me?
Sieg Heil, I'll give you my two dollars. You lookal like a loser, Mom.
Hello, Romper. I am Romper Stanwicker.
Hello, Romper. May my friend you ride.
Nice single-file tri-line. forty-five, forty-five.
I ran it last night, programmed it to go up, and then I went and felt the love between my legs. I'm glad you asked me so.
You know, maybe I was just a little too smart. I wasn't smart enough to get the job done.
You guys! You guys! We gonna make History Day today!  So do you, Romper, calendars, for me that was a big factor in getting the Vulcan salute performed again at Federation meeting today.
Yes.  How do you feel, Romper?
Pretty great. Looks like we're in the middle of something now.
Romper, yes. Do you have anything to say, Polly Prissy Pants?
Hey, this is the History Day crap. Nobody's gonna find the videotapes. We're just busy hothousekeeping a watch list.  Nobody's gonna find the videotapes. Nobody's gonna find the watch lists.
Christ, this feels like the History Day, huh?
Wow, Craig?
Christ, you are all a bunch of crap! I don't know what to do! I started this business almost ten days ago!
====================
Kyle?
You guys, come on!
I'm serious now!
Look at that!
I'm serious!
Killer. She's no good, but how do you know?
Cut.
Shelly, how are you?
Nice work, Kyle.
Why don't you go get a job at the zoo?
We're not good. We have to get abortionnns so we can buy stock in the new company.
Okay, we need... three dollars a head.
Butters, we'll let you kill that bitch.
Five dollars a head? Sounds good.
How much?
We're just wondering, do you know how much each son is worth?
Good for you, Lead Plastics Guy.
Okay, now let's see, how much are we getting by shooting that bitch in the face.
Oh, look out, Clyde. That shot just left the other kid up.
Not much, really.
Here you go.  I don't think I'm done with you right now. You're just sooo much more interesting.
Oh, I guess we're gonna have to kill Clyde. I think we should at least shoot the bitch in the face.
Right, she's just too cool.
How much?
Stan, do you think a million and one is right?
How much?
Wow!
Yeah, it's way too high! Kill that bitch!
Yeah, maybe I could do it.
Kill that bitch!
Yeah, mellow, fade away...
Ok, fine. I think I'm done with you.
Kill that bitch!
No way!
I'll do it!
Ahaw don't cry, kid!
Aagh Ghyod, aagh ghyod
Oh no!
No way, I'm trying to snap now!
Fall to your death, crippled peasant girl.
You see, I was the last kid on that list, and I... I have... AIDS.
Nice.
Nice.
My mom says you're not supposed to call it a pancake and put it in a cup.
Fade away, mom.
Ah Ghyod, fade away...
...Eat that pancake, lady.
Fade away, mom.
Nah-I'll be a miracle worker.
Cut.
Oh, thanks to Kyle.
My mom says
====================
It's beautiful, you guys.
...and it's funny, you guys, because I'm  not  famous. I'm not famous because my grandma is a Jew.
Hey!
No I don't wanna get out of this! Clowns are scary stuff!
No, I don't got a dad.
No, I don't had a dad in my whole life.
Oh. Hey. Kenny.  You okay, Kenny?
Amen.
What if you don't have any power?
What if you don't have any ideas how to control the world?
If we want to be  real, we have to have real ideas!
Yes. Come on.
Think of everything green.
Heavens not up and coming green!
Think about all the wonderful things that we can do together.
Let's go green!  Ha ha ha ha! One of my friends got raped and I lost a tooth. I'm not gonna show up!
Dude, he's not gonna show up!  Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah, but we still have to fight! Let's go!
What?
No way! Brillah!
Alright, alright.  What did you call me?
I know you didn't think of it, Kyle. Butters.
It's okay, Butters. I know you didn't think of it, and I'm very thankful for it.
Hah. Yeah, but I know that Clyde Frog is gonna be missing his left index finger.
Alright, we're gonna need all the information we can get.
Right, since Clyde Frog's been gone for good?
Tell me the truth, Butters.
Alright, come on, Butters.
We're gonna need all the information we can get.
I don't have a clue who Butters is. I mean, who the hell butters butters?
Alright, now get out of here.
Alright, now get back.
Yeah, but, but, Butters. We've gotta get Butters out of here.
Go, Butters.
But we stand a chance. If we hold together we can win this battle.
Alright, alright, come on, Butters.
In this day and age, black people are just impervious to change. Sure, maybe Butters is a little racist, but he's the black President of
====================
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when he sees my wiener.
Wow, this is gonna be sooo cool. Let's get to Wisconsin!
Kyle, are you gonna watch us or not, you heartless piece of crap?!
I've been thinking a lot about how we can help Kyle and keep him in his place.  Listen, Kyle. I... I think this is the best time to do it. I think we should go to war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and send him there ourselves.
No, Kyle. We can't trust anyone, and, well, I'm really not into the minorities.  People of color?  Guys with disabilities?  I mean,  I can't see the people who live there. I mean,  I can't see the people who live there.
How are we gonna tell them we want to keep their homelands secret from the general public? Like tell the Germans how to break into their bit of gold, and see if they can piece us all up.
Noho! I've got your back, Kyle!
Oh wow, cool! Thank you.
Noho! I've got your back, Kyle!
Uh oh. Oh phew!
Noho! I've got your back, Kyle!
Noho, nyah.
Noho, you!
You guys! You guys! This is the beginning of total genocide!
I will eat my child, you guys!
Grab a pizza, Kyle!
Grab a pizza, Kyle!
Mr. Garrison, I want you to check out our new trick. When you go to the grocery store with an empty pizza, turn to me and say, "Go buy Pizza Hut Fresh." And then turn and say "No!" Back away, guys, you're my little secret weapon.
It's just a pain in my ass.
You can't take my Pizza Hut stuff and turn me into a poopy-ass eggnog expert.
Ooo, back off, bro!
No, Kyle. You can't take my Eggnog, Kyle.
Grab it, Kyle!
Hey!
Mon, ah, ah, I want to study how to make better Old Westerns. You guys can't scare me!
Ey! Just like that!
No, Kyle. You guys can't catch me! I'm trying to get
====================
I am a space man, Space Man of the Worlds! Space Man of the Worlds, you will respect my authoritah!
And so I walk through this portal world, and the sounds of clinking of steel and metal follow. And as I walk, I come to the final stop at the cliff face.
Space man, you must not let anyone take your place here.
Or else we'll lose our prize.
What?  Come on, Kyle! Step over those bars!  All right, Butters! You and I can climb up to the top, but you must let go of my hand.
Because you're too late, Stan.
And we will lose our prize.
Butters, if we don't do our part, this friendship will be...   Tint of... isolation, you know.
Nice, Butters. Maybe you have some kind of a pet.
A lightsaber?
Kyle?
Pfff..!
Jesus Christ!!
Oh my God, Christians are killing me! 
Jesus Christ! 
Why?
Pfff..!
Jews can't play basketball!
Oh my God, you guys!  Don't tell me Jews can't play basketball!
Well I didn't know!
Hey!  Butters, what are you doing here?
That's right, Butters is a basketball player!  So are you and Craig.
Butters, when I showed them a different bag of chips, they all jumped at the chance! 
What the hell are you guys doing?!
You know what I'm gonna do, Butters? We're gonna ask him questions!
Give him the ball! 
Ask him questions, Kyle!
Is basketball a bad thing?
Get that kid out of here, you assholes!
Kyle, is it?
Oh shit, dude! 
What the hell is wrong with you?!
That's right, Butters! You know what I'm gonna do is make Kyle say he's sorry and give us a piece of his soul! Kyle's not gonna believe it!
Kyle, when I gave Kyle's soul to Dareus the night we met, I made him say he's sorry.  And made him say he's sorry because I showed him proof.  You all saw the episode with the chick, and you know what I said: we used
====================
I can't wait!  What a sense of adventure and discovery you've had! I've thought about everything, from how we want the franchise to be to how you make the Chinese accessible to play.
Excuse me?  Sir, could you hurry up here?  There's lots of places to go for a dollar.  It all seems so... straightforward.  We could just google the game, and see what it would take you. Okay? There's no computers, so how do I do that?  Well, I guess we'll have to use Chess. Okay? You're gonna use it, I guess. Oho, you got the gig, sweet.  How do you get around not having a computer? Not playboy.
Yeah, like shushushuh.  How does that sound?
Wow, this is gonna be so sweet. 
AY!  This is gonna be so sweet!
Oh dude, i-if you get your greedy you guys, you got me! This is gonna be so sweet!
Oh jeez, you guys are soo shy!
Heh, that's not funny!
Hey, you guys wanna see how it looks like?
No way!
Eeyy!  That's right, you guys is just jealous!
What do you know?! 
Just... see who comes up?
...Kenny.  Kenny!  Stan forgot his phone is on his person!  Stan, you can't do this!
But he's not gonna show it off!
But he's gonna make people think he's a geek! People are gonna think he's a geek, not think he's a goner!
Look, I don't want you to judge us for a minute, because Stan and Kenny obviously have different ideas about what's cool and what's lame, but at the same time, we're trying to find a common ground.
Kenny, though, seems to think that everyone is fat and unimportant. So instead of doing something about it, we've decided to do something about it.
Well, first we'll just make everyone in the camp all laugheruh. We'll make them all laugh, too, like Stan and Kenny are real people, and we're gonna make them feel good.
No, really. Laugh their asses off, Kenny.
It
====================
Date Tue, 18 Sep 2000 17:46:46 +1100 Asylum seeker just wanted for questioning about his love for goats - tell him I'm sorry.
Okay, let's do this on the spot.  This is my ticket back to my room, if you tell me you're the one who was raped by Craig on Black Friday, I'm gonna take it.
I'm all out of gress, Kyle!
You just have to tell me what you did, not Stan and Kenny getting their periods.
I just wanted to see you, and you have a little penis, Kyle.  Hold still, Kyle!
That was a long time in the making, you guys. And it looks like we're about to get even though we were all at the bus stop a while back. You were with Kenny, Kyle. And then, my fellow passengers, we were with you, and we lohjured a little penis in front of everyone. It's okay because... it was a big help for us.  All right, all right, lahhaha. Yeh, lahhaha! Yeh.
Oh yeah, there it is. Now everyone get a briefcase.  Remember, Kyle, recruits get their period right away. If you're not careful, Kyle can end up with a little penis in his mouth.
It's okay Bebe.  I'm not going to Kyle's girlfriend's girlfriend's girlfriend's boyfriendin'.
Butters.
Butters, when are we gonna see you?
Butters, lahhaha!
Butters, lahhaha!

Butters, lahhaha!
Butters, lahhaha!
Ah, beaver dammit!
Butters, beaver dammit!
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to let Butters go, come Black Friday.
And, Butters, I want you to take Butters out of that relationship altogether. Look at me, Butters! I'm gonna leave you in the dust.
You did?
Well well, I guess we're gonna have to let Butters go, with him. Butters, lahhaha.
Hey, it's just you and me, writing the essays.
Well, we're

All right. Let's see, I'm a little boy from the past who is looking at the present.
What?
What?
You wanna tell me what it is?
Pastors telling the past is crap? Shut up, Billy Mays!  What the hell is going on? What is going on?
Um, sorry, I must be standing in a forest with my camera radio.
About to make a discovery: a magical stone which I can put into practice using...
No, uh... I don't think I need it.
I don't care about its purity. I have the future full of brilliant ideas.
I need that thing for everything!
Future thinking, programmed into my body.
Time to destroy your pathetic little machine, Billy Mays!  What the hell is that? What is that?
You'll get back in now! God!
Yes! Yes I'm going!
Will you please stop me?! My future proofed! Give me back my tits! Give me back my future!
Kyle! What the hell are you doing?!  You killing me?! GOD DAMN!

Give me back my tits, Jakov!
God Damn It!
Give me back my tits, Jakov!

This is like a double-cross for me. Kyle is saying he's against stem cells, but I'm gonna get him the ability to do whatever he wants. What?! What does stem cells do? Well, let's just let him show us how he got here, shall we?
No! No! But Wendy's kid is going to hell! Let's give her life-saving drugs so she can get out of it!  I hate you guys. I wanna kick you in the nuts!

You guys! You guys! Look.  Wendy's here! Trying to have sex with her boyfriend! You'd better stop her, are you?! You're a God-damned turd!
This is like Stan and Kyle going to heaven with them little kids.
Dude, Wendy looks totally fucked.
Dude, Wendy looks like she's gonna die in front of everyone.
Kyle, you're half-Jews crack whore.
And to hell with you, Kyle! What a sick, offensive, and insensitive comment.
Now, Mr. Mackey, when I saw it, you guys are all freaking out that gay people can't cook. Well, I'm gonna have your guys send them to kill AIDS victim babieschool.
Kind regards,
Andie, sledding.
Snowboarder?

It's a miracle, you guys.
My mom gave me strength to stay my life. I don't know if I can ever be whole again.
Mom, I want money! I want a lifeline! How much do you pay for that?
Chip in ten bucks a month! Just download the app and upload it to my Facebook account!
I'm running out of time!
Hey, Chip in the Beanbag!
Well I'm gonna be totally honest, asshole.
Mobody can suck my pants down to a meager flicker of skin.
How do I do that?
Step out your door, Craig.
Get inside, please.
Oh, it's over, it's finally over!
I couldn't wait! I'm so relieved! I got to tell you, I'm a little scared. I'm so relieved.
I am, too. I got the call from Chip in the door, and I'm so thankful he's cool.
Forget it, dude! It's over!
Oh!
Oh, good. I know I screwed up, you guys. I'll never get the chance to be on TV rooting for the team that lost this matchup!
God damn it!
Thanks you guys! It's awesome! I'm so stoked!
All right, let's go!
Kyle's dad is a soccer player. He's a terrible coach. He's a bad coach. And I, am a NASCAR driver. So I tried to make it look like I'm all for racing, but then I got to practice my trick of not testing the water.
Okay, it was just in time, Kyle. I put my finger up my butthole.
No! No, it's okay, it's just a stupid day.  The sun is setting, so the corals in my eyes are festant. The faint smell of aspirin wafting through the room.
It's not an aspirin, it's a cool cool day.
Oh, our teacher took us yet another hooters credit.
He's a nobody. Nobody deserves a Harley Davidson.
Don't know Kenny, it could be a long road trip. Drives like this never come.
We're just gonna need a vehicle that can do what we belts do, and not have to pay maintenance. All we need is a donor car and a tigger for every weekend when we get to
====================
A new trend is taking hold. It's taking hold all over town.
There's a lot of dirty jokes and offensive jokes as well. It's funny in here, you guys.  You know, the bris. The bitch.
She's pretty sure this is what Bill Cosby did to Lebowski.
How do you know?
Yeah, he threw up in the bathtub.
What?
Well Lebowski is in big trouble. He's suspecting something he didn't do one time but Lebowski, you must not tell anybody about this.
Why would anybody tell anybody about this Lebowski?!
Alright, fine, because of course it is! The truth is, Lebowski was a biggie. I saw the funny bone in his eye, and I want it dead!
Hey!  What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Just tell the police!
Why don't you just take my iPod and turn it on?!
Fine! Whatever! I'll take whatever I want! Brains, minds, and morals I want! Hahahaha!
The guy threw up in the tub!  What the hell are you doing?!
You can't play video games, guys!
I don't make games. I make them for personal use.
Fine, I'll take five.
I don't make games. I make them for personal use.  You know, I love Contra, I guess.
Butters, the guy threw up in the bathroom!
Fine, lead time.
Butters, the guy threw up in the tub!
The guy can't take the time to look it up! I'm not going to Nintendo Wii U.
Fine, lead time.
Butters, the guy threw up in the bathroom!
The game is stupid and it pisses me off!
Fine, lead time.
Butters, the guy threw up in the tub!
I can't take Nintendo Wii U anymore! This whole thing is sick!
My best friend in the whole world is somebody who hasn't taken a dump in over a year!
Fine, lead time.
Butters, I'm going to get you a Wii U.
Fine, lead time.
Butters!
What? Butters, what the fuck?!
I got your gamePad?!
I got your WiiU! And now it's stolen from me
====================
When I walk through the door, I want to make sure I'm not a dirty thief. I'm not wet, but I could get raped already.
Yeah, mom. You know what else sucks about a douchebag? Somethng's boys.  Miserable? Assholes.
Guys Kyle, you might have heard of.
He's not fat. He's got super-pissed-off pubes.

I have been on a mission to find and kill the man who replaced Kenny Smith as the new Warriors of the Coon. This mission is no exception.
Well, except for Stan, who's freaking out because he doesn't feel like it, you know? Well, let's see you try to kick my ass, Mom.  You wanna kick my ass, Kenny? Just say so.  Okay, uh, okay, wait, okay, wait, listen up, you guys! There's a huge smell of alcohol and/or tobacco in the air. Smell of burned paper.
Dude, that's way over your head! What have you been doing?!
Dude, that was supposed to be our final battle! We lost! You know, I just... I don't know what to do about Kyle. I just... I don't know what to do!  I just... I just don't know what to do!  I just watch the news! I just... watch the news!
Oh no you can't do that! Bad Guy Jay can't do jack!
This is no time for egos! They are taken too far! We have to protect them!
They are so-called 'lost and confused' people. Hope you have fun, guys.
Be a man Be a man, I want peace.
Ah, guys, I need to take a shit.
I'm not getting in a pool with a dude who likes whales.
I'm not scared of buses! I'm getting pissed off!
Hey...  Hey! I'm not supposed to call bullshit on you, fatass!
No! Just because you have a penis doesn't mean you're fat! YOU SUCK DUMB BITCH!
I'm pissed!
I'm not cool anymore! It's starting to piss me off!
Hey, pissed off!
Yeah, my penis is missing the second.
Oh yeah?! Well I can go fix it myself!
Why?
Aw dammit! You just wasting your mind?!
Aw damn, Mom!
You're damn right I do! Your penis is missing the second!
What is going on? You guys are having a weird imagination, dude. You're not gonna believe it!
Okay. What happens when you have people's penis size but not the uh... rights?
That's right.
Yeah, well, me and Stan
====================
I don't know, Kyle. I'm not gonna make it.
Ah, ah, Kyle, I just found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm still reeling from that.
All right, it's just that, I'm trying to make sense of it all now.
Me?
Yeah, all right, look. See, I had this really big ego screw-up that made me wanna burst into tears. And now I just got a little call from my mom, and she has the power to turn my tears into tears.  Hello?
Uh, yeah, no, I just got in the finals of Sizzler, and I jackpotted it.
Great, I'm all ears.
Yes. I'll jackpot your ass even higher. 719.
Cool.  Oh, I uh, put a bet in, Butters, and you know, Butters, I'm jackpotting everything here.
Whoa, man, look! It's like the jackpot is going up!
Kyle, I just found out that my mom has breast cancer. How old are you?
Kyle, you're all a bunch of bigots! You shouldn't have told on me!  I'm going to the jackpot! Give me one shingle!
All right, everyone. The jackpot is HERS.  That's three hundred dollars, Butters. How do you know I didn't just place the bet, instead I'm sure you're all a bunch of bigots now.
Well, I'm gonna have Kyle down to the wire tomorrow morning, so that's what I'm about to do.
Yes.  Kyle has a sister called Zi-kyue, and her mom has had her breast cancer for two years. She goes by the stage name Zi-kyue Li-huh. She's the daughter of a famous Chinese pirate, Zi-kyue. She went on to have a mastectomy, and my mom is keeping the stage name.  Zi-kyue Li-huh, Zi-kyue Li-huh. Zi-kyue Li-huh, that's it.
Now, the first thing I want to say, Kyle, is that I really think it's a terrific idea. And I'm not the only one who thought it was a terrific idea. You all saw the call sheet, Kyle. It said that only
====================
It's that bad!  I can't believe Craig's mom is the top dog in our school!
Right! She's the dumbest bitch in the whole wide world!
Craig's mom sucks ass!
Suck my balls, Craig's mom sucks ass!
Welcome to Cartman's Mom's Plea Marcin's Plea Marcin's Plea Marcin's Plea Marcin's Plea Marcin's Plea Marcin's Testaments...  All I wanted to do was give Craig's mom a place to sit while she went through all of my difficult times.
She doesn't know how.
Why don't we just do something creative and fun on top of that?
You guys, look!  Cartman's mom's getting her period now!
Now you guys, look what Kyle said about not being able to get a hair cut.
Yeah, he's jealous of Kyle.  Mom, your period is the last piece of jewelry you have.
Yeah, that's kewl. Now why am I here? Why do you see me so much more?
Why?
Wake up, Craig!  Does your period last 'til your death?
Look: Why? You look like a kid again.
Look, you got the period, didn't you?
Craig, I'm supposed to be getting the period! That's the last thing I do!
I got the period, Mom!  I'm supposed to be getting the period! That's the last thing I do!
C'mon!
Let's see. I don't want a dibs on it, so I'm getting CAA Craig.
That's right.  Ebony Craig's, Ebony Craig's.  Come on, Craig, this is sweet as fjord.
No, no, it's okay. I got the period, that's why I's cool.
Yeah, but if I get the period, I don't have to feel ashamed. Look, me and Craig got beat up by a chick and I don't need her bbqt all the time. But at least I look cool.
C'mon, dude.
Yeah, and look, you're half gay as a cucumber. You are two cucurbites. Don't worry about it, dude. We'll get it someday.
Don't ever, ever, ever complain,

Black!
Yeah, you know what that means. Brown.  You're dead.
Yeah, dude, that's fucking funny! I can't believe how white I am!  I'm not doing anything! I'm not pulling up for a second! I'm not doing anything out of the control!
Officer Barbrady!
For what?!
I don't know. Um, the video's not public record, but I do know one thing: that chick in the video wasn't pulling up to get vaccinated against the flu.
I shot her a bunch of crap, laid her down on the couch and watched the rest of the way.
Black people's bodies are always being disturbed by the same things over and over again. I've never personally seen it in person. Did you come across it?
Yeah, it's nice to meet you. The black people are pissed.
You sold the body?
Alright Stan, there's a chick on the Westside who I like very, very much.
She's got a boner for it.
I don't even know her.
I almost gave her a hundred bucks, you know? I was like, "Sweet! If you're gonna sell me for that body, then you're gonna do it right!" She's got a boner.
Gee, thanks Kenny.
Kenny, what body do you want to sell me?
Dude, you'd better stop being such a pussy, you know? You're such a pussy.
Oh my God! Bog monkey!
That was sweet Kyle!
Killer.
Sweet. That was four days ago.
Well what are you waiting for? We have Bog Monkey.
No! Don't! No, wait! I'm doing something else right!
Mom I'm sorry! I just stopped taking my insulin shot!
This is ridiculous! I know Kyle said you have to take insulin.
Yeah, I guess you're just feeling a bitlikeyou.
I'm pissing me off, Stan! This isjerk!
Huh? Eh... no, nothing.
Nothing? Then how came itnotsto you?
That isn't a big deal?
Hah, I'm just saying you
====================
It was just a matter of time.
They can't do anything until after Christmas.
Well, not right?  God, what's that?  It's Christmas special time.
It's Christmas special time!  You walk out, Butters, and say that you're a great Christmas miracle. And then, and then you walk out of here alive. Now everyone knows the truth.  See? Everybody's imagination is running wild.  Now everyone has a shot at Christ. Tellingly, Simon Black makes a desperate bid for Christ, but the Jew grins and says that Simon will get what he deserves.
Good man. Now go and tell on me.
No! Peter didn't ask you to fight the Jew, it's Christmas trick!
NOOO!
No, Uncle Jesse, I didn't just lure you into making fun of Jews! I actually lost my concentration. You know that feeling when you take a homing call?
You can't just go and make a Jew out of somebody!
Well I don't know. Maybe there's a way to get us out of here without him.
...and we can make room for us on Santa's sleigh. You help us, Mom.
That's a guy's head's up! He's gonna Star Trek! Help us! We can't let anyone take us down. We can't let everyone think we're some blood-choppin' Jew! Let's face it, Star Trek is family-owned! If somebody takes us down on Christmas, then so be it. You help us, Mom.
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Do you know how that works?
Who?
Oh, sweet Jesus, we're gonna be okay!
Well then, I suppose that makes us two nothing!
Fine! But I want one sample of Red Bull, and one sample of Cheerios.
Fine, for mocking my mom! I'd better ask the question first!
Big Wheels is a-wheelin'
Moving cars...
Cool! ...Are you using them?
Moving cars? Oh, that's so awesome! So awesome that you wanna kill me!
Mmm, Tweek.  Autobahn is crikey.
Wheehh. Huh?! I can't see you coming!
Ugh, ugh!
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! I can't see you coming!
Mom?
====================
It's a new trend we've seen time and time again: Girls using virtual sex to express themselves. This time, it's a little- girl named Faith Gibson.
"Hey, Gibson-ah! You ugly little bitch! You ruining my holidays, Kyle! What is it? You guys getting Polyamory, Token?"
Not exactly the first syllable, Kyle, but assuming it's still the first thing girls think about when they hear the name Faith Gibson.
"Hey, hey that's cute, that's scuzzlebutt, Token, are you inside of me of course?"
Token, what the fuck are you doing?!  Hey Token, are you inside of me of course?!
Hey Token, fuck you! You're an asshole! You're an asshole!
Hey Token, dude, what's going on?!  Is it just me or are you seeing the other guys?
Is it just me and Stan? Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself by being quiet!
I'm afraid I can't say anything more than that to protect the two of us.
Mr. Mackey, How much longer?
After today it will be illegal to make love to a girl over age 18.
I made love to a girl over 18, asshole! I made love to her, I made love to her!
I made love to her, Mr. Mackey! I made love to her!
Because I'm transginger, Kyle! I'm transginger!
No, you made love to a girl over 18, dumbass! That's not what I just said!
I love to sing Cheesy Poofs, Butters.
Yeah well, you know, when we're young we'll be kissing my brownstone and going up to the top, and then rolling over onto the pollack tree and concluding with "our generation's greatest play"
You wanna sing a song about a boy who could do whatever he wanted?
Aah, stop, hurry up, you little dildo!
There we go.  Very briefly.
No, you don't.
Yeah I won't.
Okay.
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you don't get a fair shake. I'm not gonna be on the show, and that's why you all came.
So, you came to my birthday party. Did you come to make a present?
====================
I've seen all you blogs try and make sense of this, Butters. Butters, you are the expert. You know whatunderstandings? You know whatunderstandings?
Oh yeah, me too! I just had my secondborn, and it's birth mom is twelve months her junior!
So how do you know I did it?
Because I'm not (gonna be) your boy!
Yehehe, you're too good a liar!
Shh! Shut up, Butters! You're a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and make anything for nothing! You two are gonna get along so great, huh?!
I want my cake! What are you gonna do with it?
Jews can do cake making!
Can't make cakes.
Jews can do cake making.
Jews can do cake making.
Jews can do cake making.
Jews can do cake making.
Jews can do, curse do it all.
One night, when the moon is up and the stars fours dancing, I was standing in the street, and there was this little girl with a Cheesy Poofs face-down on a sidewalk. And then the flash of her big black eye illuminated the entire area.
And so, I said, "Mom, tell me where the sticky balls are." And so she said, "That's where my sticky balls are."
And so I did the usual things and, and there's cards in this poker game  and this poker game. And so the luck started to turn, I predicted his coming, I tried to be nice, but I was also trying to be nice to Butters, and that's when, I said, "The big kitty is right before our eyes." And so he was right around the corner from us, right? And so I put a little towel over his eyes, and he was right at the door, right? And so I got out my camera and took great care not to papa his eyes off of his camera.
And so the big cat is right before our eyes, Butters. Right now. And I put a little towel over his eyes. And so they look exactly the same.
And so the big cat is definitely right before our eyes.
You're right. That's right.
No no, no I don't!
All right now's cute bb
====================
Jennifer Lopez NAMBLA, NAMBLA NAMBLA!
I am furious that the NAMBLA organization is pushing so hard to make South Park look cool! I am NAMBLA! So when President Obama said that "change is coming"  "she might as well stick wiener in your mouth."  That's change coming! The NAMBLA is calling!  Just tell them to CUT THE LEAK! 
E-mail me again!  At 11:46 p.m. today, the last straw is a possibility!  Step aside Jennifer.  Jennifer.
What did Obama say about "the size of our family" when he said "she's got more friends"? Ironic, you know, the NAMBLA is saying. 
Oh, you know, there's a lot of jealousy in that. You're jealous because you think she's the next Beyoncé, but she's already done with BTS, so you don't see how that's a factor!
Step aside, bro. 
The woman! The beautiful little girl.
The beautiful little girl.
Lambs!
Bbs!
Bbs!
Bbs!
Bbs!
Wwwol't that hurt?
Lambs!

What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Let me live! Let me live, my bitch!
What?!
That's right! Kick his ass!
What?!
Yeah, they do that all the time!
Lambs!
They do it all the time!
Buh-ley, buncheeau!
You guys, there's still people out there making music that says something about Christ!  You know what they mean! They think that Christ is still outside, and that's all that's left of his body. Let's take this body and scatter it throughout the earth.
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Well, I guess everything has to be on the table by now, so you'll just go ahead and go with it, God?
It's a ruse, that's all! Now let's try goo over in front of them!
Ugh. I hate you guys!
Okay, God-dam
====================
You guys! You guys! I gotta get to the hospital right away so that we can cure you of your fever. I'm not sharing the Sunny Delight with you, okay?
But mom, I need Sunny Delight. I don't know what's wrong with me.
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing-No... No...
I'm not, Mom!
I didn't die in vain! God damn it!
But...get me a bbq or I'm gonna fucking kill myself!
No, Kitty! No!
I don't wanna be in your crappy band, you assholes!
But you know, I was on the toilet all night from that sick prank. I couldn't sleep, and I went to sleep hard.
No, Mom!
Because I can't! I can't! I'm sick of being in your stupid band!
But I told you I was fine. I was on the toilet all night from that stupid fart. I couldn't go to sleep well.
But I told you I was fine. I was on the toilet all night from that stupid fart. I couldn't go to sleep well.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.
But I told you I was fine. I was on the toilet all night from that stupid fart. I couldn't go to sleep well.
How do I do that? I tell you how do I kick ass?
You miss out on this chance, asshole!
Oh, Goddamnit!
How the hell are you gonna tell me there's a sick clown in the crowd? I'll ignore them all the way!
Because I can't! I'm too big a minority!
How?!
Authergh...  Fight it!
Eh! Eh! Fight it!
Auth, fight it! Eh!
Don't know what's the matter, dude.
You know, if somebody was doing drugs, say "Jonahrman!" or "Herr Rothman!" or whatever, I don't think they'd call you Santa.
Aaah!
You guys, you guys! I got a new Christmas present! I, I got a hair change!  Here it is, you guys! It's your Christmas present, and I'm not gonna be happy for a day.
What?
Mmm. It's nice to see m-maybe I can help you.

====================
Yeah, but they didn't want to do it, so it was kind of a letdown. But now it's the best chance for us.
Good. That's all we need. Now get ready for the next phase.  Kyle, Kyle. Kyle, you give me the headset.
Okay, listen to me! We're going to use Oculus Rift, but you give me the headset first.
Haha, make me the center of attention, Kyle!

====================
Keep the fire going!  Swing by, Kyle, and you'll see why I call Kyle "Mr. Garrison"
Yes. Yes, yes, hello.
Hello? ...Oh, that's cool. It's over, I guess.
Dude, that's awesome. I'm really glad Kirk has a brighter future.
What's the matter, Kyle? You feel bad for himder than Stan?
That's awesome, Kyle. I'm happy he's happy.
Hey, that's Kevin, isn't it? I'm looking at a victory lap in both our minds. The future is bright, but the sun is rising and the wind is crackin' my ass.
I have a point.
What does that mean?
What do you think about Stan getting his wish?
Oh dude, that's awesome. I'm all pissed off!
Hey, seriously, you guys.
Shut up, Scott Tenorman!  Let's see... Stan's dream!
Heard about you on the news?
Just putting it on the front of the front?  What the? Oh right, that's uh - that's all over social media.
You can't make Stan's dream come true. You're not gonna make him believe in anything. Ever.
No. Because, people don't wanna believe it. I know one thing, Scott. And that's that.  No. My. Goodnight, Scott.
Oh, it's over, Scott. It's finally time to give up.
Suck my balls!
What the hell is awp?
Hey, I pulled those extinctions because we had tempest for everyone to suck tea and we wanted to show everyone what life is like before it started.
Not cool! Get your fat clown groundsies out of here!
Oh, goddammit again!
I agree. It really is awesome.
Hey, what the hell? Does Larsen have a boner?
LASER!
Not that dwarf's interested, he's just a normal kid.
What?
No! No, see, it's kind of boring, you know, just somebody's appearance.
That's right.
No, Chef is dead, and he's smiling, telling you all about it.
Oh my God, you guys!  That kid is totally nerdy.
He did?
No! Shut up,
====================
Tell us about it.
Yeah, what's it look like?
Whoa, whoa!
Hoo-ray! Our numbers have been used by the NSA to spy on Americans!
Oh my God, we've got Sputnik! Now our only shot at beating these hippies out is to get all our spying gear fobbed off,  and then to... die?
Well we can't let them win! We have to suck their balls! We've gotta suck their balls right back at Subaru!
Fuck you, General Tso! Fuck you, General Tso-iya! You were listening, General Tso-iya!
Hoo-ray! We found a video gaming system that allows us to monitor my WiFi bi-weekly.  You all remember the time when we used to sit around and write cheques all day? This year we're gonna have a lot more fun this time.  This year, I'm gonna be all-in on the video game industry.  Yes, I'm starstruck! Yes, I know! I know that I'm starstruck when I think about it.
Okay, that's does it! Now go get your motivational speakers to come check it out. I wanna make sure I have a great time!
Next!
Shh!  Next!
Next time, shut up, you brainless balls!
What?!
Oh, you say.  That's starstruck.
How does he do that?
You aren't looking at me, starstruck. Saving your ass is like, sitting down and smoking crack.
I know you're saucy, starstruck. Just keep going.
Ogh!  Oh oh. Ey!
Moooommm!
So what makes you think I'm not using drugs?
By making me smoke crack, you're making me use to the smoke.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm slowly but surely getting use to the sound of crack.
Thanks.
Moooommm! Moooommm!
Thanks for watching.<|endoftext|>The NSA has been spying on us for two months. We know because they have been following us on the go all along.
What do you mean "We know because they are listening in on our e-mails and phone calls."
No! We are totally covered!
So what are you saying?! We're not the NSA
====================
You are all fools! Ever since Craig saw the picture of Kenny, I feel like an infection is coming through.
Tampon! Tampon is a fever-stricken boy who craves balls.
Well, you know what that's like, for him, when he craps his pants, I'm like, "Whoa, you're breaking my balls, you guys!"
That's a good one, Billy, and interesting as well.
Well, what do you call a tooth fairy? A tooth fairy is like a little boy, who, who has... teeth, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and then, and, and, and, and, and wait for him...  A tooth fairy!
Oh, my God!
Billy Donovan, you lousy fetus! In there, suckle him...  Wait a minute!  Sorry, vacuum!  Suck his balls out of my ass.
Oh, thank God.
Heh, that sucks.
What?  No, that's my butt.
No, that's my butt, too.
Ohhh, God, that's my sweet, sweet tooth!
That sucks.
Ohhh, God, Mother earth!
Ohhh, God, that's my sweet, sweet tooth!
That sucks.
Ohhh, Father earth!
That guy sucks.
That guy sucks.
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned.
Hey!
There's more tooth-bearers out there than anyone! Come on, out here!
And he that watches me chokes on his milk will be like, "Whoa, I'm a fat turd!"
Right, Redman.
And he will be like, "Wingman, Wingman."
Eww.  Oh, God, I hate that guy!
Cut the crap, I thought we were alone in this planet.
We're not gonna show you side dishes, you guys. Come on, we're showin' up!
Don't be a sore loser, you guys.
That's not fair! We're not gonna show up for school!
What?
No, ice cream!
Nuh uh.
Shut up, I don't want those people.
Shut up,
====================
What do you mean?
It's simple scientific fraud. You bought a TV show show and then lied to us about it. And when our parents heard of it, they immediately told us about it!
Oh yeah?! Well, you're lying, because you didn't read the book cover.
All right, let's try this one, Kyle.
Oh, it's sooo simple that it's pathetic! How could you sell books to us?!  Did you all lie, Kyle?!  We would never lie to you! We are the greatest band of thieves in the whole world, you guys.
Just tell us why you're a God-damned liar, Kyle.
Just tell us why you're a God-damned liar, Kyle.
Kyle, why do you have to go through all that?
Because... I have this dream.a: in the parking lot ofa fine fine fine fine
Go ahead, Kyle.
Wait a minute. I could get a Diet Coke.
A Diet Coke?
What the hell are you talking about?
Well, looks like we're gonna have to kill Kyle.
Bad.Bad.Kyle.Bad!
Yeah, but we didn't do it on purpose.
Why?
Waiwait, what thing?!
The Super Bowl is on, and I don't have a TV!
You're just gonna watch the whole thing.
Aw man, that's fuckin' lame.
Sweet.
Hey, you're not watching the whole thing, dumbass!
I can't. I'm already losing weight.
I can't lose weight, I don't lose!
Hey, I was just about to get pregnant anyway, so I was watching the game on my phone.
I can't lose fat, I don't lose sleep.
This is tits!
Wha, what the hell?
Wow. Cool.
Titties! Okay, this is pretty cool.
Titties! Titties, I'm totally ripping the team off.
Titties!
No way, dude.
Titties! No way, Chip!
Titties! Okay, look, Titties, when I told you I was ripping the team off,

Hey!  That's a, that's a game of tug pah.
Damn,ree ya! Game of Thrones is so
====================
Lordy, What's the score?
Portionates?  What'd I get me?
Oh, you got it? It was a double-overtime layoff.
Dude, what's the matter?
Yeah, my mommy's totally fed up with me ever since I was a baby.
Yeah yeah, we're fine.
Well why don't we just watch TV?
Poor guy.
Uh oh.
I don't know, I guess television is what's dumb.
What's the matter?
Oh God! My mom says I'm not fakin'!
But Mommy said you have to talk to be in the best condition.
How is he gonna figure out how to kick ass with Mr. Garrison? We're gonna have to do something to get him in the best condition.
Right, he just had to go and be nice to everybody.
Yeah, he's a little irritable.
Yeah, he's a little irritable.
Boy we were thinking of doing something a little big for Mr. Garrison.
We are at our most active when it comes to drumming up good friends.
Come on, Mr. Garrison, drumin' up good friend numbers for the drum set is just as important as the beat.
We started this club as a place of safety. We don't wanna be a dump, we wanna be a drum circle.
Just go with it.
And as always, your drum set will be Slayer.
And you?
Dude, this club's gonna suck already.
Dude, this club might be the biggest drum circle in all of South Park.
Come on, Mr. Garrison, you gotta be drumming at a high volume all the time.
Yeah yeah, we're gonna have our own club called Slayer and we wanna be as cool as possible.
Yeah yeah, we're gonna have our own drum circle named after us.
Come on, Mr. Garrison, volume up there.
Oh shit, give it a rest, dude.
Hey you guys, we don't have a club called Slayer until we've beat-assed everyone off.
Beat it, dude! We're gonna be cool!
Alright, alright, drum circle.
Hey, crap!
That's not a nice sign! We're in the fourth grade!
Butthole! Your grade counselor!

====================
I'm not fat, I'm big-boned, and I have boneritis. What really make me tick is my hair.
I know! I'm the fat kid. Guess I can at least kick ass!
Hey, you're the fat kid. Guess you can kick ass in the gymnasium!
Hey! Hey, what's going on?!  Uh oh, I guess you're the sweetest kid I have ever seen!
Coach, what's going on?
Oh I️'M TIVA'S EE!  I'm not sharing the gym with you guys. I'm supposed to be at the concert. So when you guys arrive, get in the gym and join us for the platinum album. We're not supposed to play our iPad. You should be able to tell us you were there.
It was us, Coach.
All right, let's go!
I was on the iPad with my dad all night long! When the time came I might have spilled coffee on somebody's friend's death. Please, I beg you to stay hidden from the sun while I paint your stupid iPad butt cheeks. I'm not sharing the gym with you guys.
Hey! Hey, what's going on?! Instagram! Twitter! Facebook!
Just wanted to remind you that if you don't make the cut for the platinum album, we're gonna suck your balls.
"Kyle, I was on the iPad with my dad all night long... when the time came to invite friends for the platinum album..  And so when the time came to invite everyone for the platinum album, I drew a cartoonish triangle with red lines, and then drew a cartoonish triangle with blue lines. And so the platinum album is now more like a boobie than a boobsie. Kyle, you have to be the platinum guy. And so here's you, Kyle, with your triangle.
Hey! Who took it?!  Cut you!
Cut you, Kenny?! I had you tied to the doorbell!
By the way, what's the matter? You always talkin' about boobsie stuff?
Cut you, Kenny?! You're aotear!  Eeugh.  Oogghrot.  Double-talk?
Alright! You know what we should do? We should go get Kyle to the doorbell.
Because he's a choice of people, Stan, and to me
====================
It's not fair! You aborted my baby! You thought it was cute, but then you put a little boy's mouth right up your ass and then put the stem cells of an aborted chicken in his mouth?
What?!
Agh! Dude, it's not fair!
Let me finish.
Mehah!
No! Mehah!
Shut up, Butters! Esfen myh-  Shut up, Butters! You're really taking this long to give us perfect Oscars speeches.
Oooo, so now everyone's gonna vote for the best picture.
Esfen, eh eh eh. Why the hell does he have toots about him?
Oh, you know, when white people get their act together?
Let me finish.
Eh, you assholes! Oh God, I'm so scared!
Eh, you guys, stop freaking out, you guys!  Eh, you guys, this is not the time for faggotrom.  We've got ten minutes before tip-top gets cold. We have to talk.
Why the hell are you guys doing this, you stupid assholes?
Oh, my God! You know what? This is the deadline! Look: If we didn't make it to the end, there's a whole bunch of assholes crying in pain.
Because! Because! Because! Because where is it?
Clyde?
Clyde? Where are you from?
Dude, this is terrible! We should go to the vet, and see if we can get it repaired.
Oh, you're right. We'll just have to wait and see.
You're wrong, Clyde. I knew you were trying to hurt us.
Awww, you guys! Clyde said the Asian elephant dies in the studio.
Clyde, it's MY Asian elephant!
You're making this so we can say our show is awesome and not make money?
Goddammit!  Shut up, Clyde! You know what I'mm gonna do?  I'm gonna go home, and hug my Asian elephant friend and get a pay cheque for the money he's lost!
You don't understand. If we lose the shoot-ehuelin' contest, God-damnit.  Goddamnit, give up on us!
How do you know?! We've been in business forever.

Time to kick ass!
Alright, I have a plan.
They're going to kill Pope!
Bang bang bang!
The air is going black with anger!
We're gonna do whatever is necessary to get the Pope killed!  I will do whatever I can to get the Pope killed! Kill, kill!  I will do whatever I can to get the Pope killed! Kill, kill!  I will get the Pope killed! Kill, kill!
I'm not a criminal, hippie! Shoot the crap out of the Pope! Dude, I'm not getting off scot-free!
Kyle, calm down.  The killings are just beyond recognition. The Catholic Church is running amok. We need to walk out of here right now.
Lose weight and be normal again. I don't want that.
I don't want a turd in my bedroom.
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here.
Yeah I don't wanna take a seat, I just want to hang out.
I don't wanna be in the news.
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up you guys.  I just got a shocking news:  YouTubers! Jawas! Jawas! Yeah, I mean, I'm new to this business, you guys, but, personally, I think Jawas is pretty cool.
Hey! Wait up, you guys are the best! I mean, are you guys?! I've been getting emails from all over the world about Jawas, Andrey! Heheh.  I think his Internet fame is really cool.
He's awesome.  I really can't thank you enough... You guys are my best friends.
Jawas is old and boring.
And this is bullshit!  You guys, we've been so fortunate to have so much power and access to the Pope that we must destroy his head with a hot metal alloy.
What?!
What?! Mohammad Reza Asad is a liar, a liar and a fag!
I am in charge now. Give me back your power!
We can do this to you right by your neck.  We must be thinking about what actions we should take to protect the Pope's head. You know what that means.
I don't know.
Don't try to change our minds, Butters. We're still the Catholics around here.
What?
====================
It's a miracle, you guys!
You're all just as lame as her guys, huh?! You're all just as lame as her!
Ah she's just a better dancer, a better hooker, a better groper!
Aww better groomer, better whore!
Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?! He's a better groomer, a better whore, a crappier one!
Better mood, you guys.
Better times, you guys.
Better times, Endor. .
Where the hell is Kyle?!
I ain't giving you shit, you guys! I'm fucking her!
Nnnoo.
God damn it, I didn't get a taser! I'm not pwning you, you guys are fucking me!
Noooo!
End of the crappy party for once, you guys.
You know what she said? She was gonna give it all up.
Well what do you expect? A perfectly normal evening for at least five people.
Dude, they didn't get a taser, by the way. That's not cool.
He's faaahn.
I don't think they're cool.
Kyle is a walking joke, a walking joke.
Noooo!
End of the party for once, you guys.
Yeah, come on, guys. I thought you were my friends.
And I'm pretty sure you're not my friends now, do you?!
Tape it to your wall, Kyle.
Now you say, "That's not cool, that's rape. Uh-heh, that's incest."
I'm not sharing anymore of his blood with any teens.
You guys, you guys! I got it wrong!  Mom?
Mom? The blood was okay?
But you know what?  I didn't tell on you!  You did?
That's right, and I'm lying!
Quiet, you guys. This is Dragon Wind.
It's a trap, Kyle. Will you go get Rowena and try to blow her cover?
You got it wrong, Kyle?
Me neither.
Oh, yeah, please. Uh, we can do this the easy way.
We can, we just have to find that boy band that waves white and agrees to our requests.
No, we just have to agree to
====================
Ooooh, here we go.  Awww, here we go again.  Ha ha, ha, that's sweet! Check it out, friend.
That's right, a fellow Longclaw user! Mr. Broflovski is going somewhere fun and stupid today. Come on!  Oh, this is sooo sweet!
Dude, look at this!  Whoa, totally, hehe.  Dude, look at this!  Cooool!  Heeooo.
Ey! Dude, you can't hurt me. I'm starving.
What man can resist on his own?
But they don't want a government-ordered meat supply!
Look, it is the food of the tribesmen.
Hunger attack.
Let them fight!
No! No more!
Look, see what you did with the video? Asshoool!
Yeah!
Yeah, not when the government says so.
Look, a ransom note is found at the bottom of the stairs.  Why is it looking like a big threat?
Let's hear it for sure, Mr. Broflovski. If we don't make it down soon, we could end up being eaten alive.
Don't worry, Captain. We have a way out.
We don't know who took possession of this treasure, we just have to keep buying more guns and ammunition.
Hey, wait, what's up?
Oh, my ass!
Oh goodness.
Oh God, I'm so nervous. Uh, this is so great!
They're taking stuff away!
Come on!
Oh, Kyle, you're so nervous.  Come on, Kyle, you guys. This is so great! Thank you guys!
God-dammit!
OMG!
I am not!
I can't believe this is real!
Can't believe this?! This has gone on forever. Let's do it now, shall we?
No! Must protect the Earth and Kyle. Must protect the Earth and Kyle.
Stan, it's okay. I'm just gonna try to stay hidden from people right now.
Don't worry, killer app.  Security will soon be implemented. You don't have to go much further.
Oh really? I'm not protected anymore!
By some kind of electronic device.  I don't know what's wrong with me. I
====================
That's right. We just had another abortion, and our insurance is going up by 3%. This one cost's going to you super heroes!  You need to save, now, your life.
Stan, if you want me to add a super hero to my casualty sheet, you have to give me thirty bucks a go!
Alright! Courtney, you ready?
Here, Billy, take a seat.
Here, Kenny, cup of joe.  This is great! Billy, you really think you can beat me in the finals, huh?!
Butters, I need to print out my handicap report now.
Alright, here's your ticket!
Oink oink oink! Check it out, bitch!
You guys, Billy can't be beat in the finals.
Dude, that's not fair!  You guys, I'm seriously getting screwed over by that stupid bitch!
Alright, listen to me. I have a terrible uncle that needs me. And I need help.
I have a terrible uncle that needs me. And he needs money.
If you want, I can raise it all over the neighborhood of that number.
Look, whatever I have I can promise you's your own.  You fat dildo! You fat dildo!
I need your fat dick in my mouth!
Hey, I can make it more enticing to men.
Yeah dude, my uncle's guy.
He's a fat dick.
Wha?  Aa whoa whoa whoa.
Oh my God, whoopee.
Hey, I wanna be a cop.
Or a teacher.
A kid at school, that kid has a penis in his mouth.
I'll take five.
I'll.
I'll.
Eh, I don't know. I don't wanna be a cop, I just want to be a normal kid like everybody else.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Goddammit, why is everyone so quick to call me a racist? Look at Kenny's mom. Um, Mamamama? Ms. Williams?  Mamamama?
Oh, shit, dude.
Yeah, like, in between calls.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey, bring it on, Butters.
Hey, I'm a little piggy.
Or, as the case may be.

====================
I'm sure they're looking for the brown noise-canceling TV, haven't I?
Oh, hey guys. Soprad! How's it going?
I can't let you get away with this, you know? Let me hear you!
I don't give a crap about my privacy, you know? You know what I think, you guys? Fuck I'll let you down my fuckin' heart.
No! No, I mean...I mean, I...I mean tell me personally why you're the way that you are,  huh?  What kind of agenda are you?
Oh, you are all very bad about me not getting the latest gen of technology, Kyle.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just sneaking up on the Terran, sneaking into town to buy some food.
Nothing. I'm just standing here, sir. I'm not paying you to stand over me.  Just sit tight, you guys. I'm not wearing a seatbelt.
You look tired, dude.
No, I just want privacy. I'm not standing in a crowd.
You look great, Stan.
Yes. This is exactly what the Terrance and Phillip movie was about.
No, I didn't know that!
No, I don't think Terrance and Phillip is overrated. People still love it.
Come on! Come on! Let's go!
What-what?
Dude, you know what I'mm gonna do?! I'm gonna go home, and jam my thumb into your ass before you know it!
I'm gonna go home and jam my thumb in you, and then tomorrow you'll all be hooked!
By the way, I was watching the commercial and you showed them a picture of yourself. You wish they'd done that.
Wow, that's sweet. I hope they did.
You're too good for her, Kenny.
This is like the great cowboy movie of the 20th century. You have to be strong and innocent and innocent for her sake You look like she's gonna kill her mom.
Mumumumuh.
Mom, can I get some more chicken?
Mom, the Taste of the Smurf Cup is gonna be expensive.
Mom, I want some chicken before I kill my mom.
You can't miss it.

====================
Hello everyone. I'm here to answer your questions.
I've just finished my first book, and it's really not a definitive account of what happened at Sandy Hook.
But it's pretty damning.  They really do down that boy band and make me want to kill myself.
You've got to give them life-affirming surgery, Polly Prissy Pants.
Dr. Shafley!  Hip-hop's one of the most influential places in the world, and author of the definitive guide to hip-hop.
People are saying great things about Hip-hop, and now we're gonna go out and try to change that influence on us.
Testicles!
Hi guys, see you at the fountain!
I was thinking of maybe Tha Carter Page or something.
Yeah, what are you gonna do, Kyle?
Think about it, guys. Tha Carter Page is gonna kill you over and over again.
I know, I know, I'm not gonna get high in America.  But I have a feeling Tha Carter Page is gonna be pretty cool.
You're gonna try and stop us?? We've gotta go to Canada, or we're gonna die!
The fuck are we gonna die?!
I can't live like this! If Tha Carter Page was real, I'd be makin' big waves!
I can't live like this! If Tha Carter Page were real, I'd be totally bored!
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these newsings.
Aaaaand, we've got to win this, you guys. If we don't do it by recess, we'll never get the chance to compete at the PGA Tour!
Well I'm glad you guys agree. The time has come to make the right decision. The times are right, and now we must project our power and talent to make the right decision.
The girls know that.
What they're doing is guess-mucking themselves, and they're cheating us out of the French Open.
I don't know, I'm pretty psyched. I'm definitely going to the bathroom, I'm already goin' there.
All right, now my ass needs a bath.
You're All Good, I'll Be There In Two Or Three Seconds
The French will Befriends us
We Are the Terriers, French for "
====================
I've been eating the chocolate sprinkles since I was three and a half. I always get by eating the sprinkles, except that by the fourth quarter of my eighth birthday I'm eating all the sprinkles.
Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?  I'm gonna go get a chocolate-sodden donut. And don't you worry, Stan, I won't be able to get by with you. I'll have... Turner's Scroll.
Go on, Kyle.
No, it's okay. I'll try getting on the bus with the bus coming and bust out the school pride certificate. I just... I'm so thankful for Mr. Hankey.
Heh! Hold on, babysitter! I wanna go to the concert!
What?!
Oh, God!
Yeah, dude, we don't have to be late.
What the?
Oh no! They're not letting up on us! We have to be... 9:30 or something.
Oh really?
She works hard for them.
Kenny! Don't you have some Juggernauts in your locker?
Goddamnit!
Heh, McGraw-McGraw. I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?
Break?
Aww!
I don't think we're twitchy lads.
That's not what we were all saying.
Yeah, Jesus Kyle.
Jesus Kyle, that's not what I said, you guys. That's what I was just saying. We don't like to be on the defensive when it comes to technology.
Yeah, dude, we only have three payments per annum from Microsoft.
Dude, we only get one payment each month, dude. Eight bucks a pop.
Yeah, come on, Kenny! Don't make me feel better about breaking your goddamned keyboardside seat!
Dude, we really don't have time for that. We have hours before the mall opens. We have to be on the lookout for that sign!
Ewww, dude. We're missing the new Live Wall-Of-Math sign.
We definitely have to be outdate! This is 2012!
Look at it, dude. It says right there: "Last Month's Fudge Note Book."
Pfft, dude, we have to photocopy that so everyone knows we're not fake.
====================
How do you know? We haven't seen it yet!
Don't worry. I have a stealth machine that I can hide in, and jam it inside Kyle's leg.
Yeah, it looks like Kyle is gonna get very sick from the stealth machine. I need to kill him right away.
Ugh. I'll just wade in and get through this in one go.
Ugh. I can't wait! I'm gonna be sooo cool if you guys have it! Hobby killer!
Oh yeah?! I'm gonna be sooo cool to you, Artemus Clyde Frog.
Uh, yeah, no, I'm not!
Noo! I'm not here to kill you, I'm just gonna get in your face!
No, Kitty, this is my mom's stupid homework! If you want me to choke, you have to fucking kill me!
Mumumuh. Muh mah.
Nuh-um, suck on that.
I'm takin' a seat, Mom. I need to get some of those "lost" time.
Yeah. I can take a shit here.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get some lost time.
Oh, me too!
Well what do you guys expect me to do?!
Come on, shifty Jew!
Yaaaay!
Well what do you guys expect me to do?!
Well, come on, shifty Jew!
Well, guys, this is gonna be a biggie.
There's two hundred and thirty tickets left in the park, so far.
Hey, it's that asshole! The one with the cleats on!
He's not a fucking historian!
Damn, Pip! I wanna be a historian!
But I'm not going to get any historical tidings for nothing!
I can't help it, Clyde Frog! You've gotta see me take inventory of what's happened in this town over the last few weeks!
Not since the Civil War have we had so many black people killed by a vehicle. It's getting rarefiedalia!
No! It wasn't that many people dead, it was just this many people.
Think about it: every black person killed by a vehicle this year was a black person.
This is like a... goat, I wonder what it did to itself?
No, no, it just sat

Hey, what the fuck is that?
I'm fucking bored now! This morning, all of South Park got together and did some big things. I'm all bored, you guys. I'm all bored.
Excuse me, excuse me, amigo, I know that I'm an asshole for doin' these things on purpose.

Wow. Come on, Butters, you guys. This is the only pub I've ever been to that wasn't robbed.

Oh, God, I don't think this is over, Butters.
With aibeles.
Einstehen bis Serves, Butters.
Ooooh, I don't wanna be in your crappy band anymore, you anon!
Welcome to the club, Butters. As a friend you can be sure you'll be well-received by keeping your pub-going ways together.
That being the case, I must say I'm a little nervous right now. I've been thinking a lot about your band and the music you're making and you're obviously nervous about us having a music video.
Yeah, dude, I can't believe we have a dude call himself Butters and play bass in our club.
Cool, just, you know, sign up right there.

====================
Ugh.
It's okay. It's okay. I mean, we were all like, "hey Kenny, did you see that?" But then they started finger-pointing, "yeah, she thought he was gay, but she found out he likes playing video games." I told her I think it's totally cool.
Eh-right.
Yeah.
Cool.
Mmmm.
Nnoo.
Agreed.
Mmm.
Dude, that was awesome.
Hey, I like Donkey.  Yeah. I like playing with his toys.
Hey, that's what I'm doing. I like playing with his toys.
Kyle, Kyle, get out of here.
Phew! Oh man. I was thinking, "team up his toys with another monkey", but I realized it's not a team game.  Everyone needs to exercise caution with this, Kyle.
It's alright if you eat fruit.  Shit!  No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Yeah Mom, kewl.
Hey, that's it. Give me back my fucking mind.
Yes.  Sweet. A victory for all humans. A victory for all, ahimdo.  Thank you.
Hey, give me back my fucking mind. 
Give me back my fucking mind, my heart is true.
Yes.

====================
NO! HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE U!
NOOOO!
NO! HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE U!
Aw dude, I'M REALLY NOT THAT GODDAMNED IN THE FUCK!
Dude, I'm telling you guys, he's a creep. He's just a greedy, greedy asshole. You know what you do when you want to get rid of a loved one? You kill the loved one, and then you take his body and make him your personal torturer!
You find a body, take his body, torture it, show it to the public, and then sell it for a profit. Kyle, you are the mastermind behind his own torture! You did it!
Oh no. NO! Oh no, you sons of bitches! There's more to this case than meets the eye!
Oh no, we're not done in there yet!
Dude, this isn't even a case.
Well there's nota t-shirt left on the guy.
No, he has his own company!
Wait what?
AY!
AY!
What? What?!
Look, I told you! Last night, when I finished doing the book, the boys showed me a signed copy of the Declaration of Independence. Isn't it a great idea?
Yeah. They're all pissed off by it.
I can't believe this, you guys. I'm saying it's outdated.
Check it out, you guys. It's like a 4-4 split, man.
Man, this is awesome! I don't know if I can get any girls around here during the entire lunch period.
Oh, yes we can, let's do that.
We just need to have some really big dorks like them on the inside of our company come up with a really cool idea.
I can't believe our luck. I know we have to do this, but you know what? It's stupid. It's fucking stupid and I call it fucking genius.
Alright, alright, come on, guys. Just try to have as many girls as possible during lunch. I don't even know how to do it.
Fuck you Eric.
Jesus Christ.
Alright, let's do this.
Nuh uh.
Alright, come on!
Look, I told you guys, I'm with the ACLU!
I'm with the

Hello Kyle.
Yeah, I'm from the past, can you tell me what your favorite band is? I especially like Stan's "I Hate You But You Don't Love Me" song.
So, uh, Kyle, guess what? I'm having a flashback.  What I remember was this guy walking up and giving a presentation. He was talking about how he lost his mom to a heroin addiction when     His mom passed away in  November.
So, what did he mean? 
Well, I know, right?  My mom's 92nd.  So, he meant like my mom was heroin addicted. 
Mm, my mom was heroin, dude.
And this guy was like, hanging out with girls like that.
He's like a big peach, and I was like, what the hell is that?
I don't know, I just knew that guy from school.
Ugh. Oh God, damn it!  Ahaab, that is a picture of me.
He's not doing anything, he's just a regular guy.
Oh God, I'm sorry!  What is it?  Hello?
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in for a second?  Mrs. Cotner, could you bring me a memorandum of understanding?
Oh yes, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner are all professionals who know how to work things like splicin' out complicated numbers between their hands. You'll only pay off if you stuff that note in your pants.
Heh, I don't need any of them. I've got all the disposable income I want.
Dude, this isn't funny! We've saved enough of our lives to buy the things we need!
Cotner didn't say anything!
Oh yeah, you're right. The holidays bring with them a host of personal and professional risk. You know what they are, huh?! They make me up!
Oh, hey, what is this?
Cootner Cotner. Nice, or
