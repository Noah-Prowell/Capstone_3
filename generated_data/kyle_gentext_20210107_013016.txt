Dude, I thought we were friends.
Wow, cool.
He was huge.
Who are you?
You have to go with him, Cartman.
Don't worry, dude. We'll be right there.
Ah, hey, Cartman.
Cartman?
Wow, dude, how is it that Macross is all getting made available to all those people?
The first guy is making a big commercial about the Pokemon Company.
Yeah, and I think it's pretty awesome.
Two million? Dude, I think it's gonna be okay.
Wow! How much have you got?
Kick ass, dude!
Oh, y-you're Stan?
Well, I'm Stan.
Not like Cartman is.
What are you talking about, dude?
This is awesome!
Oh, yeah. I think I owe you one, dude.
Yeah. Macross is too complicated.
Are you in on this?
You aren't iambic?
Yep!
No, but hey, you're in luck!
This is my new favorite part.
Oh, God-damnit!  Oh God, I have to watch this one again.
This is so awesome!
You're on, dude!
Will somebody shut him up?
Oh God, will they?
Whatyyah is this?
Shit!
Dude, this is gonna suck.
What is "shit"?
What?!
ya know nothing about terrorism, so we used terrorism!
We used terrorism!
Yeah, dude!
I'm so confused. I can't look.
I'm splaying my ankle.
Dude, I just found out that my mom's having an affair with the news.
I'm not playing Detective anymore.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
You're on, dude?
Get out of here! I'm not even playing Detective anymore!
You're not Detective, you derelict!
Officer Barbrady, I want you to play Detective because I know it will be the biggest mistake you've ever made!
I'm sorry, but this is taking forever. Please, you have to stop!
The only thing keeping me from playing Detective was your family.
Your grandma would rather watch Britney Spears than watch you play Detective.
What are you talking about?!
I
====================
We aren't kids anymore?
Why the hell would you DO that?!
No, we own Ant-Man.
Look, we're nothing if notghastly, protege. We ripped your jacket off, and dragged you through the earth to be sacrificed!
Oh God...
God, this is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Ugh, asshole, yeah!
I think he's following us.
CHEF!
We're not kids, we own Ant-Man.
Why the hell would you like a fad?
WHY ARE YOU DOING MEANERS!
ART CREDITS!
You dirty fads finally have an artist!
ART CREDITS!
That's retarded!
Yeah. Dude, do you know how many times we've been promised a million dollars and a million and a half to do our thing.
Stan?
Hey, Stan, this is how we're gonna help Make America Great Again.
Yeah.
No, we're sorry.
Oh dude, we're so sorry.  We're sorry.
Well, we've been working really hard to get this movie made. Please, you can stay away from that company's kids.
Stan, you can't get into that company's house!
What are you doing?
Oh. Dude, we're sorry.
We're sorry.
Oh. Right.
We're sorry.
...I don't want to enter any of your company's subsidiaries.
Uh, but if we do, you'll have to pay our mom and dad.
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
I don't like corporations!
I don't!
Well, I'm not really happy about that either.
I'm also not really happy about that.
I'm not completely sure.
I want to be nice to my company's employees.
Yeah. And if I do, do I have to pay the guys?
Hi. Guys!
We learned a lot in school. You just stick together!
Look, we're gonna make America great again. Remember that?
We learned that people from around the world can shop here to make ends meet. We're gonna make tons of money.
Uuuh, Ike. You want us to spend the weekend here?
What a stupid question!
Yes, come on!
====================
Hello!
I'm Kyle Broflovski.
I'm Kyle Broflovski.
Uh, Kyle Broflovski?
Uh, hi.
Oh, hi.
...No, no, Kyle Broflovski.
No, you wanna go to Canada.
Go with us?
Sure!
All right, I's it. I'm going to Canada!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
All right, Canada?
Let's see what you've got.
Let's just... look at him.
He's tall and bust.
You guys, we should join us. Come on, look!
Kenny!
On this date, Momma!
Yummy!
You're alive, Stan.
Jesus, Stan!
Hey, Stan. Where's Cartman been?
Dude, maybe we should go to Canada.
Come on, Canada. We can change his mind.
He said she wants to go with us.
No, dude, we have to get to Canada.
All right, I totally can go with a dream.
Scream!
Uuuughh!
They told us to hyperextend!
What if we do? Then Heyball is gonna start his own band.
What if we do a big show?
Yeah, we're Canadian. We've got another chance.
All right, you guys are fatter than ever!
Yeah, because Cartman is in here. He's gonna weigh 400 to 400 pounds.
Hey, Cartman. We got a fatass to play guitar.
She's okay, Stan. Just start playing.
Holy crap, dude!
Hey, this is all the Internet smoke screen yearns for!
A reindeer?
...What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, we got some video games to play?
Ready to go hunting, fatass?
Are you in Canada?
Okay, Cartman. You gonna get some practice with the kangaroos in your backyard?
Go, Cartman. Poke-carts are cool?
What?
What are you doing?
What sport?
Cartman, you're not gonna get high again until we get to the town where you started it all.
Wow.  It looks like a UFO.
Cartman, don't you see that it's
====================
Hey, you're scaring the crap out of the world!
You know what? I'll bet it's not you!
I'll bet it's you!
I'll bet it's you!
I'll bet it's you!
I'll bet it's you!
I'll bet it's you!
You're not scaring the crap out of the world, you fat bitch!
HAAHH!!!
Hey, look.  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! There's a mall somewhere!
There's a mall somewhere!
Uh, look.  Hello?
Uh, are you sure?
No, I don't think so.
No, that's a great idea.
What's the matter?
...No.
I don't know.
...What the hell are you doing?
That's, that's, that MGM Grand...
You want the Terrance & Phillip trailer?
Go ahead.
The trailer?
Well, okay.

Yeah, now you know why!
How about we just go for it on the phone?
You haven't liked him, you've wanted one for years!
He's your man!
You're not gonna like him, you know that!
I've tried, but he's... gone. He doesn't wanna be with you.
You got him for a cool price?
How about we just go for it on the phone?
Hey, look, we're goin' to do our Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Hey, yeah, do you wanna come back?
What do you mean?
Yeah, come on!
I got 'em!
You wanna come back to Kenny's house?
Well, why not?
Yeah, make up your mind!
No, I don't wanna play Detective anymore. I don't wanna be one of them.
Why?
You have to listen to what Cartman's doing.
You mean he's following
====================
What's this all about, Cartman?
A boat ride?
Well, okay.
Aboard the new Sony aced the same night.
I don't know.
Hey dudes.

Oh. Thank you, sir.
For God's sake, Cartman!
You bastards!
Oh, you're shootin' 'em up.
Hey, that's a loop. The loop is telling you to keep going.
It's a trap. They're trying to get us into their band.
Oh, dude, look at the back.
We want a picture of your dad.
His dad's a meth lab.
He's a tough guy.
We want to know where Cartman is.
You bastards!
Oh, sorry dude.
Yeah, this is gonna suck.
Get off of it, Cartman!
Yeah, this is gonna suck.
Go on, Touch the Everything star.
Get off of it, Cartman!

We want to know where Cartman is.
Where Stan's living in San Diego?
Yeah, this is really hard.
Get off of it, Cartman!
Yeah, I think he's at home in that house.
Bloody retarded.
You need
====================
Who is behind this?
Why are they all watching UPN?
Cartman, we have to talk to you.
If you're interested, go to your room.
Don't worry, you can watch the guys from UPN anytime soon.
Dude, I'm telling you. It's not that funny.
You can tell him or her that he's watching UPN.
Oh, dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
Go America!
Give him or her a kiss.
A kiss.
Both of you guys.
Go kiss him.
Put your lips against mine.
Both of you guys.
Damn. I thought I did.
Get outside!
What the hell are you doing?!
You know what we have to do?!
These are girls! They have to vote us for you, asshole!
We have to go outside!
Yeah. They do.
We have to go!
But where do we go?
The girls in red have no idea who we are!
They voted us off on election day! They lost!
Badger!
Okay, so can you take this stupid towel off!
What the hell are you doing?!

Oh, you are?!

You're in the middle of doing something!
What are you doing?!
God-damnit dude, you're in the middle of something!
Stan!
What are you doin'?
Oh. Dude, look. Stan, I want you to come home.
Come on, this is serious!
Dude, I have to tell Cartman all the little things are real.
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Where is your mom?
Dude. You have to talk to your doctor.
(Dude, I just got this really bad concussion)
Ike, I just got a brain hemorrhage. I need you to take me to your mom for a blood transfusion.
Yeah, where should I sit, Ike?
Ike?
Ike, you can't get up.  Ike, you can't get up.
Ike, you can't get up.
Ike, you can't get out.
Dude, my parents finally agreed to let me stay over for a blood transplant. Can
====================
Towelie is my new favorite stuffed animal.
Because, fatass, he's so cute.
Yeah, let's see how he likes it.
Let's just... let's just... growl and mutter some Chinese.
What?
I'm telling him you're wrong.
Get out of here! I have to tell you something.
Just get out of here!
Goddammit tell her!
Gone are the dark clouds that had me from the beginning!
Get out of here, it's dark.
Get out of here!
I'll get in the van!

He's trying to got into the back!
What are you gonna do?
You're not gonna hurt anybody, you little wiener!
No! Goddammit!

What are you gonna do?!
Yeah, I know that it's hard to believe, but you have to let go!
All right, now go!
All right, all right, here's the entry for that part.  Dude, he's a genius!
Dude, I God-damn good job, you didn't have anybody
You bastard!
But I told you!
You bastard!
You bastard, dude!
I'm sorry Token. We had a chance to reflect on what making a great husband is, and how it can be most fulfilling fulfilled.
And then I told you, it was all about having a great husband.
And now I have to say goodbye, because I'm gonna have to take that rainbow off of Kenny's ass!
Oh Jesus Christ!
Oh dude, what a drama queen!
You're having dinenr with our producers, you crazy producers!
Yeah, you're having dinenr with our producers, you crazy producers!
What are they doing?
What is this?!
What is this?
What is this?
It's not a script, it's an actual book!
What the hell is this?!
Innocent until proven guilty? What about if the other guys are right?
If the boy says he's telling the truth, what do you do?
If the boy says he's been ordered to do by his mom, what do you do?
Okay, fine!

====================
Star Wars?
Oh my God...
You made me eat ham.
Star Wars?
Uh, whatever.
Yeah, this is so lame.
Why do they even bother? My mom won't even let me have a Lucasfilm copy of the new Star Wars.
Okay, Timmy the Blade of Nightmares.
What is this?
Dude, you have to tell everyone.
I have a good old English schoolboy.
He doesn't get along with other kids in the school, and he doesn't want anybody telling him how to act.
Yeah. He's a little boy.
Don't be stupid, dude. Timmy the Blade of Nightmares is not going to make it to school with me.
Be sure to tell everyone that you're Star Wars.
Don't be afraid, kid. This is gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Party Game Night
It's a bunch of identical twins playing a Game of Thrones poster.
Who is this?
It's just a stupid game.
Dude, you have to tell everyone that you're a different sex.
It's just a stupid game.
What the hell was that?
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make money from it.
What is this?
Kenny, are you serious? Go outside and watch The Lion King.
You're not going out with Kenny!
You're not serious if you don't go out!
This is serious!
Fine!
Kenny!
The club is going to Somalia!
There's no clubs in St. Croix, so Somalia can become a commercial hub for the global commercial industry!
No! It's a matter of life and death!
You're wrong!
He's not dead yet. Come on, fatass!
I'm not going anywhere!
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You're on.
The next time you visit a place and make money doing it now!
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You're on.
It's not cool!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
What the hell are you doing?!
You're a fake!
You're on, dude!
You're on!
It's not cool!

====================
Dude! We have to do this!
Stan gives a speech tomorrow about how hate speech is dangerous.
He's right. It's a concern I have. People who have sex with women.
I hate to tell you how it is.
But you might be on to something.
Don't worry, dude. We're getting the hell out of here.
Take this.
Give it to a friend.
Wait.
This is it.  This is the fifth graders reunion.
It's gonna be sooo soon!
...Eric Cartman?
Oh dude, Biggie Smalls was here!
Don't worry, Bro. He's gonna be here when the time is right.
Dude, what are you doing?
... Cartman?
Dude, what are you doing?
Don't worry. We're getting the hell out of here.
You've gotta help us.
So, do you X?
Do it Stan.
Give it time, Stan.
See? Use your imagination.
This is not a reality for a while.
Yeah, this is "The Passion of the Christ."
That's a big if, you guys.
No, no, no. This is an awesome idea, but will it work?
What God?
You're pregnant!
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
No, dude, we have to get rid of the virus so it can pass on the virus to the next generation!
Stan, you can't keep doing what you're doing!
What'd you say, Stan?
He'll show up.
Uh, hi, we want you to come clean and tell the truth.
Don't worry, dude. We didn't do anything to you. It's just a rumor.
If it ain't, where is it?
Then don't you even listen to me?
You're gonna take my word for it, Cartman!
No, we're not playing with firecrackers, fatass!
Let's go, dude. Check the next town.
I'm telling you, Cartman, it's not a town you're on a fake island!
No, it's a fake erala town!
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
No, it's not a town!  this is a fake erala town!
I
====================
Stan! Stan, it's me!  You okay?
What?
Me too?
You just wanna roll over in the dirt, Cartman.
Yeah, I know, we'd try to play the game themselves. But, it's so boring.
Eww. Cartman, what a stupid sport!
Wow!
Huh?
How do you know that?
Oh yeah?! Hey, that's our game! We got GRAPHIC!
AAAAH!
That was AWESOMWOM!
What would we use a gaoler for?
Uh, a gaiter. What's the gaiter for?
Oh that's, that's, that's, or something.
What gaits?
What? How do we know?
Hey dude! You got your own TV using a gaiter!
No, you got your own channel! We're gonna watch it together using video chat!
What's this about, Cartman?
Constituents can vote on whether or not they want to keep their televisions off?
Yes. The more televisions they want to keep off, the harder it is for them to keep them off!
Well, because you're not keeping them off, you're making them harder to keep away from.
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? You're not keeping them off like we're supposed to!
Yes, it's true!
What the hell?
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't have any parents!
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
It's like they told us he was somehow harmful.
Dr. No!
What happens to kids because they're abducted?
That's the point. There's no choice anymore, okay? You're destroying Christmas.
...No.
Hey, you're just saying that because Cartman is having sex with underage girls.
Because that's what they want!
What??
It's just wrong, that's all.
Just ignore it, Cartman.
Yeah, it's wrong.
Dude, we don't have time for your stupid rantings.
Go on, say what you want, okay?
Now, when is video chat enough?
WHAT?!
And if they think this is funny, we don't have time to rant until after class?
When is the video chat?
And what
====================
Eric Cartman, the new kid from Cartman's misanthropy, is totally wasted a wasted-summit on a bris!
Cartman! I'm watching you bris!
Yeah, I noticed you switching sides now.
Man, I guess this is the problem: There's really no choices.
Will you please stop showing those videos of your intestines and putting them up on Web sites?
Please?
You know God-damn well what! Now these videos are going to be viewed by millions!
Oh, dude, w-we're screwed!
What??
You fucking fatass!
David Blaine is back!
No, he isn't!
Yeah, he is. He's the new kid from Cartman's orphanage.
What is he?
Ahem.
And he's just a fourth grader getting sent to a halfway house because his parents think he's a retard.
And he's wearing a monitor, too!
No, dude, it's a third grader:
What are you doing?
And he's going to Columbus?
You've got it right with Cartman?
No, dude, Columbus is the new black hole.
This is when you get sucked into it!
What is going on?!
Whoa, dude, this is my family! They've gone from being the underdogs to the vanguard of change!
I don't know what's going on, but history is not a straight line! I'm the way or I'm dying.
Hey, that's some serious soul searching!
What are you doing?
Oh, hey Stan. You wanna go to the meteor shower with me?
Go ahead.
Dude, don't kill me. That's incest!
Okay, Cartman, go ahead.
Hold on. I see.  Oh, came to a stop.
What are you doing?
...What?
What is this?
amymymymy?
...amymymy?
This is... Mark Twain.  Mark Twain: The Boy Who Would Be Swallowed Up To Be Brought to the Table.
So what happens now?
That's fine, I guess.
Okay, fine.
The book was never meant to be joked about,  and if you joked about it you were all just a stupid stupidass, I guess.
What the
====================
God damnit!
Oh, like you know I don't belong here.
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
Let's say it's just a rumor.
Well if we all just say what we want to say, we'll get three months to prove we're real.
Alright, we'll do it once and for all!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just released The Passion of Christ.  It's today's episode of the History Channel's History Channel. The background is the Reformation.
I'm not a doctor, ma'am.
I'm a layman's guess.
PewDiePie?!
Well, I hate the minute-ago PewDiePie upload, but maybe this is the beginning of a new era!
There's no denying it, Stan! The minute someone posts a PewDiePie video on YouTube, I'll take them to task for it.
No, dude, there's no denying it. You're not a part of that anymore, are you?
I know. I'm almost at the end and I's all pissed off.
What if they just put a bullet in my eye?
How do you know that?
That's two against one, Stan! You haven't done anything yet!
Did you do anything?
Anything?
Dude, I can't believe they're targeting us.
Oh my God, they're targeting our parents!
Stan! Your parents!
They's like the parents of terrorists.
Why do they have to bomb us out of here?
Stan?
You okay?
I'm not dead? All I'mitta was a little upset I didn't believe in God.
Ssso it's not really a reason to be sad, Stan?
No!
But that doesn't mean it's right.
I wanted you to be happy, be me.
Be me.
Look, I know that sometimes things are gonna work out, and I'm sorry I'm not bettering you better now.
But isn't that, looking back now?
Are you sure you're not mad?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry but... I didn't listen to him. I'm sorry and I'm sorry.
I I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a part of this anymore.
I I
====================
Google Street View?
Yeah, it's awesome!
Yeah, I know! I'm so glad we're all like "cleared" these days. Now we can joke around, eat some real food, and just laugh.
Google Street View?
Uh, okay.  Agh.
Kenny's not my friend.
Yeah. Maybe I should have known.
Hey! That's not funny, that was actually really funny!
Kenny's not my friend!
NO!
He's a really, really bad joke!
He's a really, really bad joke!
What?
A joke.
There he is! Now check this out!
I found this ad on Googling "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally." It says, "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally."
This is NOT a Hillary rally. This is a fake!"
No it's not, dude!
I know. It's Clinton campaign bus.
This is a fake.

This is happening.
The way the world is changing. The way things are supposed to be. Things just can't.  This is what America is made of.  And that's why I feel like I'm from America.
So... what do you wanna do?
You're not from America.
Yeah. You're from Canada.
- Canada!
- You're gonna help us! What the hell are you doing?!
You don't even know where we are, fatass!
Cartman!
Hey, you know that city! We've gotta get it done here.
You know?! This is exactly what we had to do!
Did you guys ever see that beautiful Canadian Rockies again?
Hey, look over there, Stan!
Look what that beautiful Canadian Rockies do! They fly by our faces and we have to joke about them.
====================
Yeah.
I don't know. It's like everyone's trying to define themselves.
Dude, everyone's trying to define themselves on YouTube. Who's YouTube famous?!
I think everyone's trying to define themselves on TV. Who's YouTube famous?
It's hard to find a video game that doesn't have Tetris.
Is that cool?
Is that cool that this game has all the pieces?
Aaaad, dude!
Just snap 'em away!
Get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out of here!
I can't play this game, dude. I need a lawyer!
Okay, here we go.
That's it!
Here!  These are the five people who need to play the game together.
Get the hell off me!
That's it!  These are the five people who need to play the game together.
Oh my God, this is so wrong.
What are you doing?
Get the hell off me?!  Get the hell off me!
What the hell are you doing?
Get the hell off me!
Hey, look!  It's working.
Aah!  It's acting like a freak. Aah!
You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Ms. Claridge's illness to make children cry.
That's right. Aah, there's been a misunderstanding between your parents.
...And you, too.
You're not Wendy.
You're Not-
Nono-u-utor-tootoo!
What the hell are you doing here?
Mom? Dad?
I... what?
But there's no such thing as a "furry freak."
Dude.
Furry is not real. It's just an idea.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!
Mom, Dad, you've been telling me that for years!
I'm with you, Dad.
See? I told you. It's not like I'm some Third-World country?
I'm not going anywhere.
Wow, I don't have to do this anymore.
There. Check this out.  I made a fake Amazon wish in my virtual reality headset. Ready, Cartman?
You're West Coast! Now you're a fake Cartman
====================
Wuh what'd I do?
Wow!
Oh my God! That was sooo good.
I dunno.
You did?
That was... really good.
How was that movie?
You did?
Sooo much for a laugh, you know?!
And now we all have to do us part!
Look, guys, we all look like we want to be seen doing the punching bag, and we're not doing the serious thing of cheering for the team
That's fucking stupid!
Hey dudes.
What are you doing?
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice guys by, y'know?
Hey, skanky poo doll. What are you doing?
Oh, thank you, your a fucking asshole!
Stonewall, it's Christmas!
Because!
Shut up and be merry!
That's nice, too.
Oh, so you're a fucking fatassilelean!
Oh, so y-you're not a fatassililetegaylkin'
Oh, so you're not a homo!
Oh, so you're not a homo at all!
You don't get presents for being a homo, you tubby little pussy!
Wow!
Oh, so you're thinking of going to Casa Bonita with my parents this weekend.
Yeah. They're just like you. They know it's bad and are just... gonna go with you.
Why won't your mom show them?
Oh. Well, you're wrong.
There's no way she's gonna show Cartman something that bigoted.
Hey! That's it! That's the saddest thing I've ever heard!
No, dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
Thanks.
What's a "gaywag?"
What are you talking about?
What?
Damn! Look at those eyes!
Hewaaaa!
Hey, look!
 "Tweek's" gaywag!
You wagged your stupid finger at everybody!
Yeah. You were about to say that, but he turned and walked away.
Well, Tweek's right around there.
You're ignoring him like the plague.
Yeah, dude.
Did the guy who raped Tweek come to South Park?
Hey, that's our music teacher. He's like
====================
Liberty Plaza
Did you see the guy's dad?
We knew!
Wow, sightseers are pretty dangerous.
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... He runs a thing called "Liberty Plaza." He takes his friends and makes them pay with virtual money.  They get out in the open and fight over $1.50 at the newers!
I thought of it.
Well, I'm Jewish.
...What?
Can't you see this is a big deal?
You just can't fight each other, you fat sack!
This is your fight or flight policy. You can't fight each other anymore. That's how we protect ourselves from cars.
No more touching cars while we're parked, asshole!
What's "walks"?
What?
Hey! We're not friends!
Asshole to wherever he's from!
This is his Facebook page.
And when he's closed he has all his friends' friends' friends' friends' friends' pages!
There's no confines and no orphans! You can be friends with all of them and everyone's not even your friend!
Yeah!
I'm following his crazy ideas!
Yeah, I guess so!
You're not my friend, you evil BFF!
What the hell is wrong with you, fatass?!
Kenny! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Yeah, she shows up late at night to give us X-rays, and gives us advice on how to behave.
Dude, that nurse is a fucking asshole!
We're missing out on some quality TV time right now.
You guys, we can't miss the next episode of Awkward Breakfast.
It's perfect!
And so Awkward Foam Filled Comedy Show is born.
This is how it's supposed to work.
Sweet.
So, make way for me, Stan.
Oh stop it, Cartman! You can't do it!
He's right! We're not going!
Why do we have to keep doing what we're doing?!
Oh God, they're gonna kill us!
Stan!
You've been an asshole to me all week! You just can't live like this!

Don't you see that it, that's horrible?! It's not a-weird?! I mean, it is! It's like, what if something happens to her? She's in a coma for a week.
Alright, that does it!  I hope she doesn't pop!
That does it!
I'm not going anywhere else!
I don't know who else to report on.
Mr. Garrison, come here.
That's a good boy.
Garrison, you've suddenly arisen. He asks you to stay here, and you say you need me to report on a serious matter.
Yes. On and on.
Please, Mr. Garrison, I must report on a serious matter.
Garrison, you are suddenly my little brother.
You exist!
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
This is terrible!
Hoh God, this is unbearable!
Yes, you do?! This is not what America is made of!
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
Yes. I have.
Yes. I have.
I'm not you, my little brother.
Goddammit, Cartman!
Yes, I know that you're not my little brother, and I'm sorry for anything. I'm just... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't have any brother.
I'm sorry, I don't have any brother.
I'm sorry, I don't have any brother.
...What?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have any brother.
I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore.
I... I can't do this.  I'm... I can't do this.
Yeah? Well... that's just awesome.
You're such a fat babyface baby, aren't you?
I don't know. I feel so rejected.

What is this?
Hi! My name is Kyle Broflovski, and this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan. And this is Stan
What the hell is going on? Stan?
You know I can't believe it.
That's two guys fighting over a ball.
That's two!
Washington Redskins!  How are we gonna get by if you have the Washington Redskins on?
I have to see it once and every two weeks.  Do you guys have the Washington Redskins on t-
Uh, fine.
What? No, no, I really don't want to.
Look, Stan, this is what I wanna know: Who is the Washington Redskins?
Dude, do you really think anybody can get the Washington Redskins on TV?
I'm the lucky guy. I have the Washington Redskins on tape.
No, I don't!
I'm the lucky guy. I have the Washington Redskins on tape.
You are not going to watch Terrance.
Why?
Oh my God, God, what have you done?!
You are not going to watch this show!
You will not get the Redskins on TV!
You will not get the Redskins on TV!
You will not get the Redskins on TV!
Oh my God, God, this is blowing our minds!
Why?
You will not get the Redskins on TV!
Well I guess we've just got to get them all thinking about what getting the Redskins on TV is like.
What if we do an episode a week? What if we're all just a bunch of whiny, anti-whiny little kids?
And if that doesn't work, what about if we just say something about how terrible it is?
What if we're just saying something cool about TV?
Awesome!
Get the Washington Redskins on tape!
Yeah, dude. I think we did a really good thing.
So what?
We're the good news.
The bad news? The Redskins are going to be the biggest thing!
Get the Redskins on TV now!
Really? What about?!
You're just a bunch of whiny, anti-whiny, anti-skippy kids
Get the Redskins on tape!
Sure.  Get the Washington Redskins on tape
====================
Woo-whataya mean?
Calm down, kid.
You're on, Dad?
The prophecy... said that the earth would be saved.
Stan?
Whoa, I'm not going back.
Ah... hey, Cartman.
It's not fair. They took all your dad's old TV.
Aaaaa!
Whoa, I don't think I'm gonna need Mr. Hankey anymore, Stan.
Wow, dude, cool.
Dude, look what it's done to us. It makes us crap out our hands.
God damn it!
Hi, everyone.
It's a surprise.
Shut up, Cartman!
That's not what I meant by being late, Cartman!
Just, you know, go find another one.
Go for it, Stan. If you missed school you should get a good night's sleep.
Read, Stan.
I know you did.
Read.
The final chapter of Where Art Thou?
Where art thou?

Screw you guys, I'm gonna break your record!
Aww, he's totally gonna get it!
Dude! Did you really want that?!
Really?
Yeah. See, if we do a bunch of quizzes on this we can really make a difference.
LAST BASTILLEGAL.
Did you really want that?!
Wow!
Oh Jesus! You actually cared about this stuff.
That's better!
Yeah.
Arousal.
Yeah.  Yeah. I'm gonna get my ass sent to Guantanamo Bay. Good for ya.
Have a seat.
Hang on, I'm a little nervous.
Hey, wait! There are kids in here!
All right, we need to get this over with. First we have to get the wrong person elected President.
Oh Jesus Christ, I have to go through all of this.
Okay, will you guys let me sit down?
Okay, will you guys sit down?
What the hell are you doing?!
Principal Victoria, I actually took a polygraph test last week, and I was misled by the school principal!

====================
His mom is pissed.
Our parents are devastated.
Our grandma is pissed.
And... she's all like, "What the hell?" And she's like, "Hm, I guess... I don't know what's going on. It's like... they took her away for a surprise. I guess... she's... reclusive."
And I say "she" by mistake, because I never knew what to look for.
What she really should have been looking for was some guys to fuck.
Hmmm?
What the hell is wrong with you, Stan?
That was... really good.
Hey, [insert name here]). You wanna come play Crack Whore?
You assholes like roulette.
Come on, Stan, we have to play this stupid game together.
What the hell is wrong with you, Stan?
Whoa!
I don't think I'm standing there feeling ashamed, apologetic for what's happening to me.
God, do I look like a princess!
Hey, that's it. I'm supposed to be a princess in the fucking U.S.A.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Why do you always do that, Cartman?!
Come on, Cartman, come back!
This is when you're gonna get us killed!
Whoa, dude!
I know, I know. It's like they let us in the first place.
You're not going in any kind of acid, Kenny. You don't even know what you're in!
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Cartman told me to do? 
And he told me to call the police!
Okay, so, what are you doing?
Okay, so, what's the plan?
...What?
You're supposed to get into the back of the bus and then get arrested.
...Okay, so, what's the plan?
You need to get into the back of the bus and then get arrested.
Okay, that's it, Stan. You're not getting out of hand, you're not going to get in the back of the bus, you're going to get arrested.
What the hell are you doing?
What happened to you?
That is gross, dude!
That's not what I was trending!
====================
What are you talking about?
Stan?
I don't know Stan. He looks like a guy who just walks around wreaking havoc.
What's your mom talking about?
Guys, dudes.
Is this the milk?
The shop?
It's a rip-rap about a guy who gets his tits fucked by a mare.
Holy shit, dude!
Oh, shut up about Stan. He wasn't talking to anybody.
Well, Stan, you are not gonna kill a mare!
That's fucking stupid!
You got it!
Jesus Christ, dude!
I'm not killing a mare! Just, I know, just learning about police work, I think, helps."
What?
"Get out of here!"
What?
"Get out of here!"
What do you want?!
You're not going in the milkman's bathroom!
That's not what I meant!
No it's not like here!  This is not your theme park!
'Cause it's a tourist attraction.
You've been here before.
No you're not!
No, this is a tourist attraction!
Oh my God! What the hell is that thing?!
Where are you going?
Get out of here?!
You're naked and you're in titty-titty pain?!
Get out of here?!
You've been here before. You know what I like about you!
Go ahead!
Oh, you're having nightmares about killing cows?
This is it. 2 million hits. That's one visit.
Go on, dude. You'll be seeing thousands of us.
Wow, dude! Your blog is bigger than The New York Times!
Damnit!
Do you see him?
Holy shit, dude!
Oh, dude!
Yeah! 'cause all our friends are watching this stuff on YouTube.
Because PewDiePie is a total dick!
You some day find a village!
Hey, look!  There's a house on the left that has no people.  There's a Perengraph online persona here that everyone can join.
I just realized on Friday that my parents aren't murderers.
I'm not a killer, am I?
Dude, you're getting really emotional. I don't think a lot of people are.
I think we should bail out of this
====================
The middleweight title fight between interim middleweight champion Anthony Pettis and now-infamous #1 contender Johny Hendricks will be the biggest night of my life. It'll be awesome. I even went to Canada and got my ass fisted.
Good idea.
Damn.
So what are we watching?
Hendricks has been knocked out in the first round. That means we're gonna face off in the beef.
Well, Mick, you're not going to get me in the water.
I'll beat you!
Good job, Mick!
You're my Super Bowl ring mate!
He's my child.
Oh Christ, God.
I'm not a parent.
What are we gonna do?
Ask Kenny if he wants to watch the fight.
Let's go ask Kenny.
How do you like watching middleweight?
Yeah, Kenny.
Yeah! It's middle-weight.
No way! It's me.
No way!
I'm never going to get a B.J.C.I. card.
I know that, dude. It's like middle-school.
Middle-earth is gonna be okay.
Not for me, dude.
Go away!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
Oh God!
I'm not getting a B.J.C.I. card.
I'm not getting a middle-class, anti-bullying attitude.
Hey dude,'m you still trying to become a middle-class, anti-bullying attitude?
I'm not seeing any of that stuff anymore, fatass.
Hey, are you still trying to become a middle-class, anti-bullying attitude?
Yeah, all you're seeing are the signs of bullying.
Hey, what are you doing to get out?
Get out of here?
What are you doing to?
What is that?
What is that?
W-what is that?
A middle-class, anti-bullying attitude.
Hey, that's a retarded idea, Cartman!
There's still middle-class people out there! You don't know any of that, fatass!
There's still working people out there!
There's still people getting benefits!
Yeah. There's still kids getting
====================
Well, all I'm saying is that it's gonna be okay. I mean, you can do it. At least one more kid is gonna get it. It's not like Jesus Christ is going to do anything.
I'm not going anywhere.
Huh?
I'm being totally serious. I think it might be best for us to never meet again.
Gays, I guess.
Well, each cycle, I try to stay on this path. Please, read and understand.
I'm a hundred percent serious. With Jesus as your man, you're gonna win the bet.
Wow!
Oh God!
No, dude, it's so funny that you're gonna go all homeless
And then you're gonna get arrested, all right?
No, it's still so hilarious
No way.
No.
That's not how God is.
No.
That's not how God is.
Oh God...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This saga knows no bounds.
No, dude, that's not the rock, the roll, the street art...
Keep lighting them up.  GOD DAMN YOU!
Yeah, I hope they find a cure for you.
I know.
Oh dude, I sign up for the final Mel Gibson album.
Oh my God, they get me in the end...
What are we gonna do?
Write a blog entry for everyone!
Give him your thoughts on Faith and Jesus!
Yeah, I think he'd rather have Faith and Jesus in space!
...And not have His face on the cover of Time!
What??
A lot of people like Action Man a lot more than I do!
No I didn't know!
Who are you?
You're not the kid that's going to kill Jesus!
You're not a teenager that's going to kill Jesus!
I knew that wasn't the case!
I wrote about the Action Man cult back in the day!
It was like a-
God damn it!
I'm sorry, my friend. That's not what happened.
Do you really think that this is a big deal?   You're lying to me?
You didn't believe me when you said I was the one who killed Jesus!
Then you lied to me again!
What's this
====================
Yeah, he looks like a real man
Like Ja Rule
Like a... Ma He Was Born In The Time Of Our...  Time Of Our...  And You... Can't Stop Being A Sexy Giant...
Aw man, here we go again! Use of the temporal time paradox...didn't lead to Jesus dying...
Wait a minute. I though...
A... curse would help him...
...save Jesus.
But... isn't there some way that...  he can go back?
What would Jesus do?
...What would Jesus do?
...What would Jesus do?
...What?
wait wait wait wait.

I don't know.

Oh my God...
What's High School Musical 3?
Are we the last ones to get it?
Craig in the band?
Well, alright, he's gone, but don't make him do this.
Dude, you said we get to get our banded together super-cleverly!
Wow, dude! Your heart's in a bag!
Uh, Craig, if you keep beating, he's going to kill you!
Dude, we can't be outdone! A thousand dollars buys you a bunch of new clothes.
There's no going back, Stan. You just have to keep fighting.
What's a "shit fire?"
Okay, Butters, what do you want me to say?
Yeah, what do you want me to say?
But, uh, now that our show is over, maybe you could try one of those "you need to go to the fire to get by" tactics.
Hide
Why won't anyone listen to me?
Dude, what's happened to your blog?
I'm not going to help you kill Kenny.
Yeah, Butters. He's our friend.
Sshh, he's blogging about food.
I don't care!
I'm not going to help you.
Phew.
Ooou, that was cool.
Yeah, butchers!
FCI! I'm about to book a ride to Canada!
Agh!  How the hell do you get to Canada?
You're an idiot, Cartman! You wouldn't even let us have a drink of water!
We're not

Wwwait!
Oh my God!
Oh, stop it, Cartman!
It's a turd sandwich.
How d-ight did you find this sandwich?
How d-ight did your world work?
And so this tangy little frog couple moved into that red-light district?
And so was this uhhh-sickened Texan couple?
I knew it! These people are responsible for this entire situation!
Oh for sure, dude!
You got your hearing enhancer applied to this new guy's, too!
Gahhh!
Yeah. That little boy in the top hat.
What the hell is he doing?
Hey, that's a wacko tourist.
Yeah.
Not a Texas tourist, dude.
What do you think you're doing here?
Over a hundred and forty signatories.
Twenty-two people.
Four apiece.
Bulk up to 40.
You're not Texan, you're a Briton!
There's still time to: molest, grieve, kill, molest, grieve, kill, all over again, all the same day, anytime!
Texan is a stupid word.
You're not, you're a Briton!
All you've done for the last four days is to tweet about how lame he is. I swear, I don't understand how the Russian Government can deny it.
Yeah.
I'm a Scotch taster. I get great ratings advice from Scotch Tasters.
Just, you know, tweet about something.
Awwgh!
What the hell is with this guy's head??
What the hell is he doing?
AAAAAAAAAA!
Washington Redskins?
Hey, that's a great idea!
What?
You know, that's not so great.
Jesus, this is really stupid.
Yeah.
What's a "home-schooled kid"?
NTB.
What's "skateboarder"?
Oh my God!
How do you know that?
Dude, did you hear what's happening?
The principal's trying to get us to stop.
Oh my God, that's your son.
Dude, he's not gonna succeed if he doesn't have a skateboard.
Well, we've gotta try making it to school.
Go, dude!
He's

Oh.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
I just found you on the Internet. Are you a sociopath?
No, I'm a sadism.
Huh?
Oh.
I'll do anything. Touch anything.
I can't even get a picture of Madonna to let me touch her.
Don't you guys know something? She's been gettingInternetcamspike andthumbnailshifting,anting andthinking.I can't even get a picture of Madonna to touch her.I'm-
What?
Oh.
I can't. I'm so scared.
I guess she's-

It's just a picture...of Madonna.
Oh.
I guess so.
Here's the one, the other one, all about this picture of her with Steve.
I think... they all got... this... problem.
Don't you? This is all the Bible study you can do.
No! No, you don't know that!
This is all the Word Church teaching!
You don't!
You don't!
This is the New Englanders Bible study!
Wow!
You really don't know what you're talking about, don't you?!
Oh. I don't know what you're talking about, but this is the New Englanders!
We have to get to the grocery store!
Wow, what do you want?!
Uh, are you sure?
Uh, look, we're gonna make it to the grocery store. Here's the official statement from the South Park General Assembly.
"This is the official statement from the South Park General Assembly. The ballots for the 2017 General Election are being counted. South Park voters will be able to elect a new president and, and have their voices heard to ensure the rule of law is upheld.
I just have a feeling that some of you are just jealous that we got to see Rebecca Hall-Johnson again, and that's why you guys are
====================
You said "gay" in school, Cartman!
Yeah! You're gay!
Because!
Dad, I don't like Tom Brokaw!
Mom, I like Tom Brokaw!
Well, I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
How do you like a gay man, Cartman?
Don't be such a baby! What are you gonna do for entertainment?
Oh, God!
Been watching this same-sex couple for years!
What's "gay"?
Oh, God! That's a good guy!
Hey, are you Tom Brokaw?
I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to watch it together.
Yes! It's so funny!
HAAAAH!
That's a good boy!
Oh, God! I almost thought it was gonna end this way.
Oh at first it was just a thought, but when they put you in touch with his new pet, it... it's gotten so bad.
You can't keep it out for blood, bro.
Oh who is that?
Whoopie.
Aagh!  He's back.
Aren't you happy, Stan?
Oh no! His wiener is gone!
Are you happy here, Cartman?!
You bastards!
Yeah, I like Cartman a lot more than I thought possible.
Eheheh, he seemed like a empty shell after World War Z.
What?!
You look great.
Hey, look.  Hey, Kenny.
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
Shhh. You can't see me?
Why do I have a fake Immokov?
Casting is a serious thing. Cartman? Come on, I have to try!
How do we find her?
Get in the head of it?!
Well, maybe she's smarter than you.
You can't tell anybody, Cartman!
All right! Let's see your iPad!
It's perfect!
You need to play this whole weekend at Casa Bonita, in the Casa America.
I want you to come and see my party in person.
And I'll even help Rebecca get an iPad.
How about we go to Casa America?
Yeah, Casa America!
Come on, Rebecca
====================
Country Kitchen Buffet.
Do you know what country restaurants are in Nebraska?
That's a pretty good sign.
Hey dudes.
What are you looking at?
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Ow!
Yeah. We're sorry.
Hey, uh, we tried.
We're sorry.
Ow. Well, there's nothing we can do.
Will you shut up already?!
Oh, you're not really here!
Why are you so quiet?
Yeah, that makes you weak!
No way, weak mind you!
You're here, Stan!
Look out! This is our new friend Garrison!
Garrison is our new friend after Weymouth.
You know what we should do? He's our new friend and he's... he's become our punchline.
Right. But Somebody's gotta change Our Name.
This is probably the best idea we've ever had. I mean, maybe we just might as well give it all up!
No, that might actually work. You know, maybe this time we could still make money doing these commercials.
No, that might be too expensive.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Cartman?!
Don't worry, dude. You're just getting kickbacks from the entertainment industry. You know that.
Because, our friend, he's got something in common with terrorists.
You're just getting a kick back from the feds.
What are you talking about?!
Stop it, Cartman!
That's not what I was talking about!
Terrorists don't like Americans to be free!
Well look no further!
Hey, look at this. It says "Welcome to the United States of America." I think it's the most basic statement we've ever made.
Welcome to America, Stan!
That's the United States.
We didn't think of it that way, dude.
You're just getting a kick in the ass, the feds!
Yeah, the Americans have taken Indiana!
Yeah, they're just trying to get Indiana into having sex with blacks.
What are you talking about?!
Go on, Marvin. We're not going anywhere!
No.  No, I'm going now.
I'm going to the movies. Somebody's gotta show me.
Hoh, hi.  Hey, this is Stan.
====================
Nope. They only made $1 million.
Now they're gonna bust your heart out of your ass!
You're not being Abe Lincoln, you're Meiji.
Get out of here! I'm not going to help you!
I'm not trying to you, Cartman! You're just an asshole who wants to screw with us because you don't believe in God.
I'm not trying to you, Cartman! You're just an asshole who wants to screw with us because you don't believe in God.
You want something new every week, fatass!
What are you talking about?
This is amazing!
Wow!
Oh God! Oh God!
I think I owe you one, Cartman.
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Keller,
Both you guys are so screwed up!
God, it's been like two days!
What is God sending us?
We're supposed to go to Jesus School together.
Oh crap Cartman!
No! I'm not going anywhere!
I'm supposed to go to Jesus School with my family today.
I'm not going anywhere!
Oh crap Cartman, I have to get off of this quick!
Why are you doing this?!
You son of a bitch!
This is not a middle-class family! It's a terrorist network!
All I wanted was to go to Somalia and play in the U.S.A.
I didn't want a middle-class life, I WASN'T GOING TO GET HAVING A MIDDLE FAMILY!
Here! This is what I signed up for!
This is what I got!
Get off of this!
I know you didn't get a good family, but you got a stupid name!
What is a "mid-class" life, fatass?!
You didn't get a stupid name, you stupid tooth fairy!
What a stupid name!
Mom?! Where's your history teacher?
Dude, my school teacher isn't my teacher.
Really?
Cornelius Libelus?
Hey, Timmy. Can we talk to you?
That's a great idea!
But isn't your teacher, Timmy, going to be any good?
What, Timmy?
How, how retarded are you?!
Yeah, come on, fatass!
How retarded is
====================
Please take a minute to comment on this article.  Please take a minute to comment on this article.  I'd love to read your essays. Please read them before you write another one.  Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh, you're doing it, Kenny.
Please stop right now.
That's right.
...You're a fat skank, Kenny.
Waitwaitwait, Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
The South Park detectives are hunting you right now.
Hey dudes.
What are you doing?
...Kenny?
Dude, I don't think you're gonna see that little boy.
Don't worry, guys. I'm gonna get hurt. Catch him tomorrow morning.
Huh?
Dude, this is probably the best night of the year.
Ugh, dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
Wow, cartoons are getting really boring!
Dude, this is really what the world needs right now.
What the hell is wrong?
Yah.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
God damn it Cartman!
Why do you care?
I... what are you doing here?
Oh.
You... righted the wrongsister's wrong.
Yeah.
I'm a Vulcan. I'm a Vulcan of European blood.
Oh dude, what a little asshole!
Hey yeah! I think he's in the toilet!
Let's get out of here!
I don't know what to do, dude. I feel like I should go to the toilet. I don't wanna be in theastronomical amount of trouble.
What's the matter with him?
Peter Pan?
Over here!
Eh now, Peter Pan, it's me!
I thought you didn't want to see me in the toilet.
Well, I guess we'll see you tomorrow, huh?
Night, huh?
Well, uh-
The next time you guys have something to do, be sure to tell my mom that it's time for us to get out of here!
All right, all right!
Hoh, dude, check it out!
It's a rip-rap song.
What?
You don't have any friends, dude. You're just a regular kid on the periphery.
This is it. This is the ending.

====================
crude creeheam - dude, it's buuuut never ever be enough.
Get out of here! I'm ba-ack!
I don't know what to do.  Get ready dude. I have to pee.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to do.  Get outta here!
Get out of here!
I don't even know what to do with it.  Where is it??
Whoa whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
What are they doing in here?
Whoa!
I guess so...
Dude, I guess you should ask the elders what's happened to you.
Jesus, this is really taking forever.
I guess we should talk to the musicians.
Yes!
Yes!
hope this helps?
no
what
I don't know what to do with it.  No I don't think doing this will do much for the band.
It's been going on for years. People are getting killed. Things are really getting rowdy here.
Yeah. I'm saying it's called "The Black Death."
Oh my God...
Jesus, what have we done?!
terrorist?
terrorist!
our stupid song about a Jewish Prime Minister dying?
yep, he's a fucking idiot!
terrorist!
terrorist!
we're gonna take down the Jewish Prime Minister again!
YEAH!
Jews will never be the same!
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Zippy, are you still on the case?
No! You're on the case.
The Prime Minister is a Canadian terrorist who's killing everyone he can against people in his circle.
There's no way we can get lost in the background. You're the only person with a computer who can see everything.
Ih it's not too late to do something.
You fight anymore?
No! You're on the case.
Do you guys know where Stan is?
There's no way we can get lost in the background.
What the hell is that thing?
Oh my God, they killed the Prime Minister.
Oh, stop it, Stan! You didn't kill the Prime Minister!
I'm not doing it, I'm not!
A
====================
You've gotta be kidding me!
Hey, that's not cool, Stan!
Oh no! Just ask her for help!
Oh thanks, dude!
Yeah, now she's gonna be sorry to see you behind her.
I'm not going anywhere!
Huh? I thought we were speaking for the day.
Wow, Cartman, the front page was this way.
Yeah. A homeless man was leeching money from shoppers.
Yeah, right.
Bastard.
It was Cartman. He wanted everyone to get AIDS.
Well, according to this, he's been doing it for a long time.
Well, we've got something to tell you about AIDS.
Well, how do we know it might be contagious?
You know, if you infected somebody with HIV.
That's sick!
Did you guys ever find out that you're not HIV-positive like Kenny?
Oh my God. That's amazing.
You guys, check it out!
He's still infected with HIV. But he's getting better.
It's better than what you have?
You guys, we've been playing here for a while.
Our purpose is to give Cartman a lot of credit for his actions.
You guys, he's doing really good.
Because dude, we have to thank you for helping us become celebrities.
Oh, thank you.
We're sorry, Mayor.
What do you want?!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah, I think so.
We're sorry, Mayor.
We didn't know where Cartman was before.
He or she is bad for the band.
What's a "pubes"?
Okay, here he comes.
Okay, come on!
What are you doing?!
So what are you doing?!
You're pregnant!
Prove it!
You're pregnant, Cartman!
He could get a pussy!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
You're not a good mate, Kenny!
Get the hell out of here!
I don't know.  I think...  that puberty is coming to a close.
Good for you, fatass!
You're a boy and girl, asshole!
What the hell are you doing?!
Oh, and what do you know about sex?
You haven't liked
====================
How much do you wanna bet?!
Yeah, dude. I'm telling you, we're gonna end up just like Kenny!
We're gonna make you eat crackers!
Oh my God, they're gonna come to Kenny's!
Rotten, they're gonna find out why I brought them to school!
What do you mean, "shit"?
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
You guys, check it out!
I'm sittin' here! This is the best episode they've ever done!
Jesus, dude. This is like the fourth or fifth episode they've ever done!
Whoa, dude!
Come on! It's the TV!
Aaawwww!
Get out of here!
Y-you can't be watching the meteor shower unless I show you a way.
This is the part where Wendy tries to get in a meteor shower with Steve by pretending like she knows him. See, he doesn't know anything about meteor showers.
Steve, this is all the way from New York. How can you make it if at all possible?
Wendy, if you're gonna make it, you have to be up there prove to be a solid two minutes before the meteor shower starts.
Uh, wendy, I'm trying to get in a meteor shower with my mom.
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Why?
Don't you just WISH you could justYISH that everyone was up here and well cared about, instead of all trying to KILL YOU!
All right, fine!
Yeah. I'm sorry I doubted you.
What do you mean?
Yeah, you're sorry?
Why?
Anything worth looking up would do!
Look, I know you don't want to, but... weirder things areier!
Look, I know it's not really a crime, but forgiveness can make a person less safe. You have to be more forgiving of others.
You should be more worried about your own safety than the safety of yourself!
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
-SLAM!
You're kidding me!
Do you know what bad press does?!
Look, my mom and dad are suing us! They say we helped pass an anti-bullying law!
That's amazing!  But
====================
What a douche.
What a fake it is.
Dear Mr. Garrison,  I am, and my name is Kyle.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Like you're my new friend.
Yeah.
Please, you're my new friend.
Oh my God.
Meeeeah!
I don't know about this, dude.
You're supposed to put their hand on mine.
Yeah.
I know. I'm the underpants gnomeslayer.
You're not my fault!
Yeah, you're my new best friend.
I don't know about this, dude.
You're supposed to put your mouth on me.
Aw Goddamnit, I don't know!
I just wanna be by your side while you do it, not worry about me!
Good job, dude!
Yeah. Wanna bet on us?
I'll bet you can't.
You can't place an alien in a burrito.
Yeah, but you can't not leave me alone.
I'm your friend, Stan. You can't fail me.
Go away!
Yeah, you can. Habitats are awesome!
You can't stay on the Eastside for long. Not until we get a new home.
We've gotta get that new Sprint here!
It's a hybrid of two species.
The first is the freshwater fish
And the second was the chipmunk rat
I beat them both, God.
Woohoo!
I beat the first one, dude. I got enough for my birthday.
Oh, you're not a killer, fatass!
I beat the last one, too. I just want to be a family again.
This is gonna be fun.
You're a genius, dude.
I beat the third one, too. I just need to get by without him.
I don't know about this, dude.
You're supposed to put your mouth on me.
Yeah, that's AWESOMWOM!
What?!
Dude, we're gonna get accepted into the Owls Hall of Fame!
All right, mister! You gotta tell me what you know!
Dude, I know what I have to say to prove a point.
But Mr. Garrison,
====================
Do you think he's actually gay?
I thought I did.
Don't... do anything about it.
Don't confront him.
Wait. No, we won't ever do that, Stan.  This isn't history.
You're not doing that anymore, you're a... a lesbian.
Become a monster.
Yeah, but you're still a monster because you didn't confront him.
You're not beating him.
Yeah, you're gay.  Hey, Count D'Angelo did exist, too.
Don't be stupid, Cartman.
No, history.
What do you mean?
Behold! That great City of...ownship over again?
What do you mean?
What?
Dreidel dreidel?
Well, that's not very nice.
Oh, Dreidel, it's that chicken.
...Dreidel dreidel, it's a little strange that he's here.
Why?
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
Wait!
I'm not going back!
I said I'm going back!
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I'm not going back.
This is their fault!
Oh, Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I said I'm not going back.
This is their fault!
Yeah!
Yeah, you're on.
Dude, you need to own it.
They're out there prowling around in the snow, like those kids do.
What are you doing?
Kenny, was that the sign you saw all these people go to?
Oh that's a great idea!
Can't you see this is your opportunity?
We've got something to tell the kids about their lives.
The sign said there's a sign on the side that says "Remembering how little we are doesn't mean we can't have fun. Remembering how much we matter doesn't mean we should screw up.
That's what trying to survive is all about. We survival lessons?
That's what keeping the fence up is about.
We've got something to tell the kids about their lives.
That's all we wanna know:
Which of the following are you?
A... Egg?
...A... Schnapps?
bad.
bad.
schnapps.
starbucks.
How
====================
Cartman, I'm not really done yet. What you all need to do is just tell my parents I'm on a mission.
Good idea.
Dad?
Will you shut up already?!
Oh, you don't get pushed around, fatass!
I'm not getting pushed around! I'm being told to kiss a certain person a certain time period of the following morning!
Seriously, Cartman! I have to do this.
I'm not a retard, Cartman!
Surprise, fatass!
Hmmm, but don't tell anybody.
You won't get pushed around, fatass!
Hey dudes.
How are you doing?
Yeah, that good?
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but you're not gonna get pushed around either.
I'm sorry, I totally respect your point of view, but I think you're missing out on some of the most important and important things in the whole world.
I want you guys to enjoy that dinner, Cartman!
Yeah. with pork rind and ginger.
What's the word?
Hmmm?
Can I have pork rind and ginger?
Goddammit, Cartman!
Can I have ginger rind and lukewarm water?
I'm not a retard!
Uh, God-damnit Cartman, you're not going to get pushed around any way you'd like!
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power.
No, no, waaahh.
Can I have ginger rind and lukewarm water?
Oh, hell yes!
Huh?
Damn it! I thought you didn't get pushed around either.
You got shoved around, Stan?
Wow, dude, how come there's not a lot of movies to be watching?
God-dammit. Here, come on! We need to watch some more of those porno movies!
Uh, H-go!
Ah I, I turn my back on the outside world. I don't want to be an adult. I don't want to.
What's this about, Cartman?
Not like this! We're going to the moon!
Oh, God-dammit Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you come out of your little coma you'll have to eat all the crackers!
I know
====================
Why do I have to put this thing back up?
I don't like scary guys.
...Okay, can we go now?
But... this seems like... the wrong direction.
We need to get to the hospital.
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
I'm not doing it either.
Wait! You're not the real Craig.
Wait!  I'm not doing this either!
All right, I don't want to be the tough one.
So... what do you mean?
I guess you know what I like best about me?
This is like the future.
Yeah. I'm not here right now.
No! I'm over here.
All right, mister tuna, you've gotta move me to my little brother!
He's okay, dude.
Good job, fatass!
Tweek was left with nowhere to go.
Yeah. This is like the '80s.
You're on.
I guess everything is starting to look like this. There's always hope. And maybe some hope just a little too late.
Nothing is more important for the 'ol best of them.
Mr. Garrison, were you born in New York?
F-ufuuhh...
Well, I is!
I'm LOOKING FOR ULTIMATE GONNA GET TO COURTESY.
No, you're not!
Mr. Garrison, no!  Mr. Garrison, don't do it!
He's LOOKING for a girl.
How can you be out of court?
Gross!
Hey, look!
Hormones?
Dude, I can't do anything. They just happen.
What are you talking about?
Hormones?
Dude, I'm just being a child.
Mom, I can't be out driving while my mom is doing what?
Dude, are you sure you wanna go?
Dude, will you let me go?
Dude, I'm really scared. I can't even go outside.
Mom, if I don't go outside, Mom and Dad are gonna shoot me.
All right, fine! You have a problem, fatass!
But what if I do?
What do you mean?
They are!
Aren't they everywhere?
Hey, is anybody there?
====================
Rebecca, this place sucks!  It's sooo gay!
Hey, sooo gay?
What does "gay" have to do with a man and a woman?
...Uh oh.
Whoa, I don't think this is going to be any fun.
Quick, 'cause I think Mr. Garrison is gonna start behaving this way again.
Don't be stupid, Cartman! This isn't science! It's just somebody's sex life.
No!
This isn't history.
Hey! This isn't history.
That's a retarded idea that won't work!
We don't wanna have sex with the moon! The moon should be the center of all sex and love!
Oh, Jesus...
Earth?
Well, I... kind of... I guess I don't feel very welcome here.
I'm a Jew.
I feel like a Jew.
Hey, Jew.
Come on!
Hang on, dude. We're gonna get 'em all together.
This is it. This is how we all feel about Moses and Jesus.
Yeah. They're the ones who taught us all morality.
I guess so.
What do you mean?
Dude, my parents want me to go to Jewbilee.
You bastards!
Yeah.
Well, we made it so that all weddings can be held on the day Jesus Christ died.
No! We're gonna make them rain on Jews again.
So what?
What kind of wedding ceremony is that?
Oh, dude, I feel so bad for having been a dumbass like that!
Hey, Cartman.
Let's just get this over with!
No, I don't! I'm gonna get out of here quick!
See? This is all about getting out of town!
Dude, that's the saddest sound I've ever heard.
Don't worry, dude. I'm getting a nurection soon.
What are you talking about?
A hemorrhoid.
Nice old lady with a hemorrhoid.
How's it going?
A hemorrhoid?
Cartman, where's the nurse?
She's in so much pain, she's not even getting home.
How come her phone's not working?
She's in such a bad way that the glass TV is buckling.
How is that gonna
====================
Hello.
I'm Cartman.
We're on the farm.
Our parents say we have a disease that makes us sick.
They've put us in a coma, and then told us to suck their balls.
They stuck us in here for eight hours last night.
I don't know what they're doing, though.
...Do you... what?
Wugh.
Well, here we go.
Wow!
Dude, what an awesome idea! We could make a commercial for Adidas!
Yup!
Dude, that's cool!
Yeah, sorry.
Dude, we're so used to living in extreme conditions these days.
Oh no! We would not dare do that!
They are stupid!
It burns! I will die in that horrible shelter!
What??
You are following a stupid trend!
Yeah, so then you promote it as if it were fact!
Right, then you're a stupid trend!
Because that's what they are! They are!
Yes, I know it's stupid, but can you just as easily give credit where it's due? According to this trend, America is at peace!  Uuuh, I didn't see it that way.
Because that's what these people are referring to!
Yeah. They're the ones that cause accidents and getting busted. They're the ones who get busted the most.
You're on Garrison?
So then how are we gonna get to the fatass?
Wait a minute. Is that okay?
Dude, that's wrong.
Hey yeah, I noticed that.
What trend is it?
Look, it's the outdoors.
Yeah, it's stupid.
We have a trend going on. You put a picture of your hand on a number, and it pops up.
Someone's going to shoot you.
That's my imagination.
Who took that picture?
Who are you?
You're not actually going to kill anybody, fatass!
Who took that picture?
Thanks, buddy.
Hey, that's a sweet idea.  You're going to be the toughest friend on the team if you don't get the urge to kill, dude.  Hey, that's a really cool idea.  Hey, we'd really appreciate it.
Hey, that's your idea of rugged badassery!
Dude
====================
Hoh, we'll give you five bucks.
You've got to try it.
Four bucks, you cheater!
Hey, try it out, Kenny. Yumburt is $10.
Have you ever trouble making it on the show floor? Come on, we've gotta go tell Mr. Garrison all about this.
Hey, Kenny. You're doing fine.
Gosh, I hope they don't cut us with stories.
I don't know.
Are you serious?
I hope they don't cut us with stories.
 man, that is a retarded idea!
Hey, Timmy, do you know where Kenny's school is?
A bunch of trees.
And you have to tell us where they're based on where they're from.
How come Timmy's school is so lame?
Try it.  Come on, Kenny, we're gonna go tell Mr. Garrison about this.
Yeah, make up your mind!
I heard it came from a turkey!
Don't be sad, Kenny. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all!
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Mr. Garrison is a right-wing conspiracy theorist!
Garrison is a paleo-terrorist who spent his whole life studying for an A!
And if he weren't a Jew, then what would he be thinking?
Wait! This isn't me! This isn't my dad!
He's a fat turd.
What do you mean?
Go ahead.
What?
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fat asshole?!
No!
I'm not going in there!
I'm going in!
In there!
God damnit!
I'm going in!
I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna show you how to lead a coup d'etat.
So, here we go.
You've got the wrong manin' head.
Dude, this is gonna suck.
Okay, this is gonna suck. Let's just get it over with!
No, dude, this is gonna suck worse. Let's just get it over with!
This is fucking retarded!
Oh Jesus Christ!
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go home!
I'm being cruel to my stupid brother!

====================
What the hell is that?
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh Wait. Oh God, I need to go to the pawn shop. Oh God, I need a lawyer.
I know. I'm from Nebraska.
You need help?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
What are they doing here?
Help?
Help?
Oh, help them.
Oh, help her!
Help her! Help her!  How can she help?
Help, you guys!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah. She's in soooooo lotus form.
Herald-bay!
Hey, Cartman. Hello, there?
Yeah, we know.
Well, we tried, Wendy.
Dude, we'll do anything to get the Ontario chapter out of Ontario. We'll have a memorial to be held here.
We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario, dude. We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario.
We're not going back.
We've been in Canada making dolls for three years. We saw the Ontario chapter on Tweek.
We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario, dude. We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario.
We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario.
We've got to get the chapter out of Ontario.
Hey, Cartman. You wanna come play at the Ontario Canada Game Day?
Come on, swing by, and see how we can get the Ontario chapter out of Ontario.
And, and we'll see you on Saturday, eh?
Advertisements<|endoftext|>The right to bear and the right to bear arms are two very different things.
Butters, what are those?
Both have the mouth same "ch", but with a different "r".
So what is it?
Well, the right to bear and the left to bear arms are two very different things.
Dude, what's going on?
Don't worry, Mr. President. I'm not going anywhere.
No! I'm not going anywhere!
This is not History.
You're gonna make it into history!
Eunice got a turkey last month, too.
...Oh, and doughty is kind of my personal favorite person.
Whoa, fatass.
Whoa, fatass
====================
Going for a spin on Cartman's theme park?
Going for a big burrito?
Going for a bologna?
Do you burrito?
Uhhh, go for it, Butters.
Dude, you're doing it again!
Wow. 
Wow. 
Wow. 
Hey, you're doing the same thing as us! You're going to a spin-around mall... and you're wearing a digital watch!
...And we'll help you see what's happening on Cartman's channel.
Uh, Timmy, if you want a spin-around mall, you go for a bigger one.
Uh, what?
No, my fault.
Tambourine!
What?
Get out of here!
Get down there!
Oh, no! No, you're not going up to the wall!
Get up, fatass! You're not going up!
Aggghhh!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
Get up, Cartman! Up, Cartman!!!
Get up, Cartman!
Get up, Cartman!
Somebody took your stupid iPad!
What would you?
You'd better go to the bathroom!
Aw, dude, check it out, dude.
I don't know. I think maybe my dad's a big Macaroni.. with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Yeah. It's a good size.
What's a "miniature" Macaroni??
I don't know. I think... mine is... 2-3 inches long and weigh about 400 g.
I know... I-I just don't know if I should care or not.
Great! You figured it out!
What's a mini-van.
Okay, where to get a new Macaroni...  Well, the store in that building is... the storeroom.  We have to go to that building, then... the clone lab.
What should we do, then?
What's the shop like?
No, I mean, come on, who really cares what that guy is doing in there?
Wait. isn't that cake?
Dude!
Don't worry. I know what to do.
You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight and make him a
====================
We're all stoked that the guys are all doing their part. It just seems so lame at the time.
Hey, Stan. Do you like watching people on YouTube deteriorate into nothing but ashes?
  Look, dude, I just got this really bad Shane McMahon tape.
Ih it's bad enough, isn't it? There's this kid named Shane McMahon who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers.
he's the biggest douche.
...Dude!
earthquake!
are you ditching us for a minute?
Oh, dude, here we go again.
I don't know.
Hey, Kenny. Do you live at the end of the night?
Kenny?
Oh, crap.
Are you sure this is your family?
Oh crap!
Don't, don't tell anybody.
What are you doing?
Kenny?
Kenny!
What are you doing?
What size are you?
You... good?
So you're Kenny Cochran?
Well, weird.
Yeah, we tried, dude.
What are you doing, Wendy?
Don't worry, dude. We're gonna get good video work.
Okay, Stan. Let's just get this video clip posted to Facebook, and we imagine ourselves as the hysterical best friends of this boy.
Good job, dude!
Hey, that's it.  There's been a call to action.  The family farm company.
We need to blog, tweet, and comment on all the comments.
Just take a look at this. Anita Brosh?
He's gotta be somewhere.
Wow, cool.
He posted a post about an iPad GamePad.
Wow.
W-well, maybe this is the place.
Dude, this is amazing.
Dude, get off of this!
Dude, I'm so pumped up!
Go look! There's actually children that go to these parties.
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap.
Oh no! Oh my God!
NO!  No, it isn't happening!
I'm a hundred percent certain.
Dude, this is it.
Get off of it!
Oh, God!
I know! That's horrible!
Hey, Wendy. Did you get your iPad game controller?

====================
What's going on?
I can't believe it! All my little brother's gone and there's no dad left!
Mom, Dad, you got busted by the hallway monitor?
What's this for?
Dude, it's Cartman. He's got a meth problem.
Dad, if my little brother's been taking heroin, I think he's been taken care of.
Hey, Cartman.
What's going on?
Yeah, all right, let's see.
Let's see if we can find a doctor who can take our brother.
Okay, get on the oxygen tank.
Dude, it's Cartman. He's breathing really easy again.
What do you mean?
Alright, get on the oxygen tank!
Dude, get on the oxygen tank!
Goddammit, Cartman! You can see!
The sun is down, is it not obvious?
Dude, have you ever heard of...
Worse yet, have you ever heard of...
Worse yet, my brother's been taking heroin?
Wow, crazy.
That's it, that's our third straight win, dude.
Dude, I can't believe it.
We didn't even get to see the third episode.
Dude, I guess we should get the episode awards for well-written TV.
Who the hell cares? We're still the same race.
Dude, I can't wait to watch the movies.
What are you doing?
Oh, God, what have you done?
Yeah! What are you doing?!
AAAAAAAH!
Here we go!
He's smarter than us.
You're smarter than us.
You've got to let him know that he has a right to exist, and to have his own podcast.
No, dude, there's something else going on.
What are you doing?
Goddammit, Cartman!
You don't really have that much power, dude.
I just don't get it.
Hey, how much do you think Mr. Garrison pay him Wayne?
Whoa, dude!
Well, I just figured we'd try to make a point when we're saying we don't want to do any of this.
And then Cartman just goes around killing everybody he sees and goes off on about how important blacks are.

====================
A lot of people will tell you it's them. They'll use it to excuse themselves from paying the mortgage on their house.  And the other party thinks it's them.
So you're their friend?
You're my best friend since grade school
Really?
What?
You're an asshole?!
I'm not putting Ike down!
I'm not putting Ike down!
Where's your best friend?
Hey, Ike.
Listen, this is really lame. There's lots of reasons why we should be putting our best friend down.
But you're being totally ridiculous by putting a guy down.
Who's Mitch?
You're a mouth for an asshole!
Yeah, yeah, dude.
So, Ike, you're really getting into it. Why don't you just talk to me about this for a minute?
Good.  Good.
Dude, I know you're all pissed at you right now. What are you doing?
What's "commentary"?
Oh my God, dude!
Okay, so Mitch said he'd get to write for us. What do you think he's doing?
Okay, so what's strategy?
Okay, so know this:
We want to be the best dad in the world.
Yeah, dude! You're the toughest dad in the world!
Dad, Dad, can't be you're dad.
Okay, so how do we get your dad's number?
Get out of here?
What?
I'm sorry dude.
Corey said he could.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of sight!
Get!
Get out of here!
Corey!
Corey!
Corey, we need to talk to you.
Get out of here!
Get out of this bitch and row my locker!
Get out of here!
Get out of this bitch and row my locker!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
All right Corey, you've got something to be angry at your dad for!
You've got something to be angry at your dad for bullying!
What are you doing?!
What is this?!
What is this?!
What is this?
What is"?
Oh my God! Somebody's shot me.
I don't know.
Kenny, are you okay?
Dude
====================
What do you mean?
I mean, Stan, you can ask me anything.
Mr. Garrison?
Nothing.
Anything happened?
Write it in. Write it in Philadelphia. Write it in New Jersey.
Look, it may be there that the police won't find. Tell them where the missing person poster is.  Oh God.
Go, Stan. Write it in. Write it in... Come on, Detective.
Look, everyone write in for us. Please, Detective.
Gross!
What happened to you?
Dude.
Oh my God.
Stan's side affects all of us, dude. It affects all of us at once.
You know, it's like we've been foraging for food or something. Or, or something.
Dude.
Dude, my brother and I have been eating for days now. It's like we're foraging for food or something.
Dude! Dude, we are sick!
Oh dude, what the hell is that?
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
Oh.
Dude, my brother and I are foraging for food or something.
Hey dude, if you need anything, you dudes just come on private jets.
Dude, private jets are foraging for food or something.
Hey, dude!
Ow.
Come on, dude! Get the hell out of here!
No dude, I'm out fishing!
No, w-I don't know if that's a good idea.
Okay, private jets are foraging for food or something?
Private jets are foraging for food or something?
So what do we do?
Private jets are foraging for food?
So what?
Well, maybe we'll get a reward for the private jet we got, but for now we're foraging for food.
Okay, so what now?
You've got to figure everything out by now.
What if we do a test run? We'll just be hunting down private jets to kill privateers?
All right, this is it!
No! Just give it time, this time we'll see what to do.
Aw crap!
Oh God!
We'll do it.
Yeah. They've got the cars and the fish.  Dude, private jets are foraging for food or something?
Well, maybe
====================
Totally!
Yeah.
You're doing it again, Jimmy!
This is gonna be awesome!
Yeh-hah!
Yeah.
You've got to hurry, Cartman!
Quick! A-bomb test!
Word!
A-bomb?
You use Cartman?
You used a-bitch?
Why?
Dammit Cartman! You're never gonna get higher than a 'D'!
You can't! Poor kid!
You've got to get off that bus!
Yeah. Way.
Yeah, he has a hundred dollars.
A-bomb?
Cartman! You're the man!
No, dude, we're gonna get on a bus to somewhere
Sweet! Way to go kid!
He's got a hundred dollars in cash, Cartman! Go get 'em!
Go get 'em, Cartman!
Get 'em, kid!
What the hell are you doing?
Oh! Hey, Kenny.
What are you doing, fatass?
You can get on a bus to South Park?
Get on, Kenny.
What are you doing, fatass?
See? Get on a bus to South Park?
Get off?
Oh, geez.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?
Oh. Uh, we're trying to reach our parents.
They're not crazy, are they?
Hey! Look!
I know. It's the South Park finale.
It's a boy and a girl.
Well, the other kid has a pet elephant.
Yeah.
Did you get enough money, fatass?
What do you mean?
Give me that!  And you thought I was a little strange?
And I'll give you five bucks.
You've got to give me at least five bucks, Cartman, to get rid of the phantom elephant!
Aw, God-damnit Cartman!
You've got to give me at least five bucks, fatass, to get rid of the phantom elephant!
I got rid of the phantom elephant, but your parents are going to kill my parents!
Yeah. They're gonna do something about it.
I know. It's the movies. They killed the movie characters.
What'd he say?
Get the fuck out of here?
Hey, look, there's
====================
Your ride has arrived!
I'm almost at the end of my ride and, well, I'm totally going with this plan.
Grab your friends, and get running!
Run!
Hi, uh, can we collect our passes for the Terrance & Phillip episode?
That's a good idea.
Hang out!
Dude, don't call our producer a liars and deceit! We can win the episode we were looking for!
Thanks, Cartman!
Yeah, that went really well. They liked it so much, we were able to get Terrance & Phillip to do their show.
What are you doing?
Ugh! That's terrorist!
You're doing it, dude!
Get out of here! I'm still breathing!
Gut they're from the air!
That's a guy from Nebraska.
That's a guy from Nebraska.
This is your home?
You've been here before?
Come on, we have to get out of here!
Ah, we're not guys, this is Terrance'iter!
Officer Barbrady, I think we should talk to you.
I don't think Cartman is a good investor. He always makes stupid money on business.
But if we're all just here, and he's all making so much money, he says we have to go somewhere.
You're always making stupid money on business?
What?
You made $1.3 million on this show. How much did you make on Mr. President's Word?
Hello.
A Dodd-Frank plan?
Thanks, Michael.
Dodd-Frank, amnesty for the illegal trade? What the hell are you doing?!
That's a good idea!
You're ignoring him?
You can't tell anybody, only me!
I know what you're doing, fatass! You're the one who brought this up, and you know it!
Fine!
E-excuse me, w-we aren't friends!
WHAT?!
Oh God-damnit dude, what have you done?!
You found my ex-girlfriend. She's bugging you to have sex with her.
You're lying to her!
This is just a stupid word!
What do you mean?
Dude! This isn't history.
Oh cool. You got a girlfriend.
Fatass
====================
We're sorry, Mr. President.
W-well, our country has been devastated by the Iraq War. We took a bunch of Ike dolls and made them our own.
So how do we be an American flag-waving, Cartman?
Look, though, we're not totally wrong.
Ike, this is the hardest part. You guys are just like us.
Look, it might be the only time of the year.
Did you guys hear what's happening?
We're Americans. That's how we look at it.
What?!
Cool!
Forgot to wear a bandage over my eye, Ike!
I'm sure going to Somalia will give me some help.
All right, mistery!
I am no longer a part of the U.S.A. I was abducted by the government of the people of Mogadishu, and taken back to my family in the United States.
I'm Kyle.
I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure this is all the fault of the U.S.A.
I'm not you, I'm the man!
What's this about, Cartman?
One night stand?
Oh, God! I have to tell the truth!
I'm sorry, but right now I'm being a pimp!
You what?
You what?!
You what Cartman, you get to keep your weapons, and go fly around and around killing people!
Then I guess he's just jealous that I'm not around more, because me and Cartman having a daughter is so much better!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
Yes he does!
He voted me a U-Haul!
Agh!
Yeah, he's a lawyer.
What's the matter, Mr. President?
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
And, and?
Don't worry, Mr. President; I'm gonna be here in a couple of minutes.
Don't you guys think you forgot something, or did you just get your iPod Nanois?
Yeah, let's go play.
Hey, Cartman. You okay?
No, dude, it's me.
Dude, I know what you're thinking. You shouldn't make fun of me. I am blessed.
Mom? Dad
====================
Starbucks is ending tobacco benefits it gives students.
The online coffee giant said it would no longer fund the Journey to get people addicted to tobacco cigarettes.
But that doesn't mean the company is abandoning people. It just means it's become more of a player.
Maybe this is the wrong company for the economy.
Maybe this is the wrong time to be a company that fads and fads.
Because, if anything, it's helping to cause a crisis.
Let's take a look at some of the big trends in health over the past year.
1. Obesity is costing the economy $1.3 trillion.
2. Americans are getting older.
3. There's more crime in some cities.
4. There's more homework you need to do to be a better student.
So what?
So what?
Well, unfortunately, our current economy is unsustainable.  And that's why I feel we should take a hard stance right now.
I mean, if we're going to survive, why the hell would we do something about it?
Yeah. We're a generation ago this idea that the future was somehow trapped in the past,  and we're just heading the right way forward.
I don't know what to do.
Just don't be afraid!  There's no denying what's been going on for the past four days!
All right, come on guys!
Yeah, we're having a hard time believing our luck is in right now.
Yeah, all right, let's just get this over with!
Let's just get this over with!
Holy shit, dude!
Yeah, see that? That's enough!
Okay, the Wall-Mart is cashed in cool!
We've got confirmation!
What the Wall-Mart should do?
Yeah, everything just went really wrong for them.
You guys, check it out!
It was great to have you back Chef.
Yeah, well, Chef, you're such an a important part of this church that I feel like I can take a beating.
You suck, Cartman!
Yeah, they just didn't get it!
Goddamnit, why the hell would they say that?!
Aaahh. Well, I was just trying to help a few people, and it was just some crazy story.
Hey, what happened to you?
What the
====================
Screw you, fatass!
I thought I did!
Yes.
Yes.
What?
No.
I'm not doing it, Ma!
This is like a third-world country.
Do you really think a third-world country has a right to exist?
I was doing a show about a half-a-grownup getting high on acid. And I was talking to his mom, and I-
What the hell?
I'm not high, Chef. I'm just saying I'm from Canada.
So what?
Really?! High schoolers don't even have cell phone companies.
You have any idea?! That part is totally fucked up.
The point is, we're not talking about cell phone companies right?
There's no such thing as a cellular company.
Shit.
We're not talking about gravy!
Get out of here.
Hey, it's Kyle.
I'm sailing away.
Yeah. See ya.
We're not talking about gravy, ma'am!
We're not talking about gravy companies!
That's not true!
Get out of here!
I don't care if I am!
I'm not going out; I'm leaving you!
All right, tell Cartman what you are, too!
Dude, you're got to tell him!
That's not true!
Get out of here!
I don't care if I am!
I'll get it!
Dude, if I do, it's on purpose!
This is not a joke, Cartman!
Why do you do this?
You're a fat skank, you're a fat skank, and you're a fat skank!
so you gotta kill me
So I'm not going anywhere!
Oh, you're right. See ya.
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
You see? Here's the control panel that tells the stars what to do.
Oh, you're right, Cartman, this is called a "genie," and if you don't go, I'll never go back.
Here! Here's the control panel that tells the stars what to do.
Now, who is that?
Dude! I don't know where Cartman is. I think he's gonna get hurt.
Whoa, dude!
Stan
====================
Looks like I'm gonna have to go to Canada and get my parents to Canada.
My parents said they can't give me a six-pack of mung mung.
You can't scare people with mung.
Mung is aunglar.
Don't eat it, dude. It's mung that's dangerous.
Don't eat it, dude. It's mung that's dangerous.
Don't eat it, dude. It's mung that's dangerous.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
I said don't eat it, Cartman!
What are you doing?!
Don't eat it, Cartman!
You're eating it yourself.
You're not eating it, dude!
What's left of your friend?
Who's Stan?
That's a retarded idea that won't work.
Hey, uh, Stan.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be with Steve Wynn, the man!
Wynn is like Steve Wynn in a stupid way. He wants people to think he's a loser.
People don't like things that way.
Don't make me do this.
Stan, I want you to come with me to see Steve.
No, dude, we're going to Canada.
Hey, Canada?
Here we go again.
I know.
It's Canada.
It's a tough decision, dude. But it's the only one I can I'm happy with.
Yeah, it was tough. But it's the only one I can I'm happy with.
You mean, "deal with it"
I. . . eh?
So, here we go again.
Yeah, Canada. You have to listen to what I have to say to the truth.
I'm a Jew.
I do not have a choice, dude. My fate is going to be decided by your lies.
What?
Yah.
You don't understand, Stan. My whole life I'm a Jew.
You're a stupid asshole, Cartman.
Damnit! What the hell are you doing?
Don't listen to him, fatass! You're gonna get killed by me!
This is not a joke, Cartman!
This is Jesus doing, you know? A lot of people are trying to stop him.
Get away from him
====================
Wow! Cartman, it's really starting to snow. I thought we were going to play dodgeball.
Dude, we are!
Dude, we are!
Noo! No.
Noo! No.
Noo! No!
Oh no!
Noo! No!
Oh no!
I can't do it, dude. I'm stuck in ice for ever since.
I finally understand what's wrong with me. But I can't just leave. It's like I'm out of my skin.
Okay, Cartman?
Go on, Ike.
Ow!
Oh no! The ice is free, Ike!
I'm never leaving!
Yeah, but I'm never gonna be one of them.  This is great!
Huh?
Oh, just try to be last time!
This is gonna suck, Ike!
I'm gonna be the tough one, Ike!
I'm gonna be the tough one!
No, dude!
Alright, alright! If you want me to be last, you have to be me!
No!
What does that have to do with Passover?
Dude! I WISH I WAS A GOD!
Anyways, you guys are just killing the Jewish people!
Oh no! No more Jews to lead!
This is it!  This is itoooo!
Nono, don't do it!
Don't! Don't do it!
I know what you're talking about, fatass!
You want me to do it, but... you can't let me join in any of your terrible policies.
No! No more Jews to lead!
You suck, Cartman!
You!
Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
Come on, this is ridiculous!
Oh no! It's not a joke!
Yeah! You're on, dude!
I've known Mr. Han for years! He doesn't even let him out!
This is so wrong.
Yeah, you're a great friend, Chef.
Gee, you're not wrong, dude.
Hey, you're a great friend, Stan.
Yeah, but you're a retard.
What the hell are we going to do, Stan?
Oh God, no!
Why?
Oh God, no!
I know!
We'll see you
====================
I'm really confused.
Can't we go back to Ike's house or something?
What the hell is wrong with me?! Am I Terrible Or Too Good To Be True?
I'm not basing all my research on "utilitarian" criteria on a single study! I read the fine print and I agree with you!
There is no such thing as a Terrible Or Too Good To Be True.
Dude.
Look! Aaaaa! There's a new Pew Research Center poll!
That's a pretty solid number.
But why?
You said there would be a "Trent Boycot" last night. What do you mean?
Do you know how many people actually voted in that YouTube debate? I thought, but I didn't know.
Totally.
That's right. Vote, anybody?
So how do we stop it?
That's 15-year-old Tyler Perry?
What do you mean?
It's a great debate, Butters. It's gonna be great!
You suck, Cartman.
But, Butters, I'm so happy!
Vanilla pancakes are the new king of sweet treats!
Oh, cool.
Yeah, this is gonna be sweet!
You suck, Cartman!
Yeah, this is gonna be sweet!
You're not gonna win that round, you fat turd!
Dude, I don't think this is gonna be any easier for you guys to keep fighting than it already is!
Dude, that video has been on TV for years!
I'm not really happy, either.
You've been in so many fights, Kenny! You know how they feel about each other!
This is gonna be fun.
Just fight, dude! Just fight!
You bastard!
Just fight, dude!
You bastard!
You bastard!
I don't want to. I don't want anybody telling me how to fight anymore.
Okay.
Yeah. Someone at Stark Industries tells me about this new company they run.
They're all going well, Stan says.
But all the people are still out buying old cars. You can't even get a Will Power Game to play with family.
How can that be?
play the house?
have at him?
play Randy Newman in a circle.
play, you shoot, dude.
him play Phillip
====================
I'm the bad guy!
Okay, Mr. Garrison, thanks.
For what?
Yeah, we got acid.
Bad.
Neat.
Hang on, I'm bleeding a lot.
You guys, I need a team!
Dude, we can't do it on our own! We're in business!
What are we gonna do??
What are you talking about?!
Guys, I need a coach!
Yeah, but he knows all about turnover.
What are we gonna do?
There's no such thing as a "dumbass."
You're on, Kenny!
Yeah, but you're on.
Agghh!
They picked up where you left off, Kenny! You're the one leaving!
This is ridiculous!
Yes, we should bail!
The college game is over, you're a dumbass!
Yeah, but you know what? I think we can win here.
Come on, we've gotta go tell everyone what you know.
Yeah, I think that college games are for idiots.
You suck, Cartman.
You're on, Kenny!
If we don't tell everyone what you know, it's gonna be really hard to keep from breaking into other kids' houses.
I heard that somewhere.
You bastard!
We don't have a coach!
Well, we don't have a coach to go to Nebraska!
He's the dumb luckster!
You're not going to get a win at Bebe's Pond anymore!
You've got to get a stupid game ticket!
Stan, go ahead and play.
He's a dumb luckster!
No, dude, you're going to watch the football game from my house!
Go Stan, go!
But I don't know about this.
Dude, it's Bebe the Waitress.
I think she's really cool, but she's really only got one birthday.
So we should buy into that?
Dude, my birthday is on Jan. 30.
What's St. Patrick's Day?
Probably.
Wow. I can actually remember being a little kid.
I birthday wishes?
What?
Awesome.
Behold! Behold! This cake!
Because it's Christmas, and Valentine's Day.
How can I miss out on that?
Oh,
====================
What's he doing here?
This is fuckin' hilarious!
Oh my God! What the hell is he doing?
Dude!
Hey, that's because he's from Jersey.
That's because he's a Jersey kid.
He doesn't even know that his mom is a U.S. citizen, which is really weird, because she's the mother of Guantanamo Bay man.
So then he wants to play basketball.
Then he invited all his friends over to his house.
And he invited all his parents.
And he invited his family over to his house.
And he invited all his friends over to his house.
And he invited his mom and dad over to your house.
What's going on?!  Why does he have a mom and dad and a-
What is this?!
You invited all your friends over to your house because you knew that being a mom and a dad were the only two things keeping families together.
And you think kids live on end because they can't find a parent to care for them, then turn your family into a bunch of cheap tricks for a living.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years.
Yes, but he lived longer than any of them.
There's no such thing as a funny fuse.
Whoa, dude!
You invited all your friends over to your house because you knew that being a family was the only way to keep families together.
Because that's what funny things are.
Oh no! No, you're not getting away with this, you're-
Bebe!
South Park.
A bunch of guys are playing Twerking at the same time.
The punchline is, "Jesus, we're gonna get busted by the o-
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
Bebe, you know Cartman, and Wendy, he's got everything.
Bebe, you got a big fat smack!
Hey Cartman.
Can we talk to you?
What's going on?
Why are they all watching PewDiePie?
DiePie?
You bastards!
On Wednesday or Thursday?
What is a "shit fire?"
What are you talking about?
shit!
shit!
shit!
Aaaaaah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Damn!
They found out he's a liar.

====================
We have a report you want us to do, Chef.

Both hooey, gayer!
Hoh hoh hoh!
Heh, I thought we were done.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
What is that?
Oh. Uh, it's called a planetoid.
...Yes.
You're having a heart attack.
What is a planetoid?
Hello?
Uh, how's it going?
Sick, dude!
What's a "gayestown"?
Wow! Hey on your luck, Cartman.
I'm a Jew. A planetoid.
Whoa!
What does a "gayestown" have to do with a gayestown?
I'm not having my gayestown!
Because!
You are making it up!
Yeah!
No!
I'm not being part of that stupid gayestown thing!
No, dude, I'm being a Jew!
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Dude! They're all gonna be wearing gayestro faces!
Hey on your own!
They're wearing Hat-Toys.
Dude, we're having a gnawing funny face when we say "Go Gayestown! "
"This is our third straight win, dude. "
"This is like the third straight year we've got nowhere to go. Go look for
====================
I'm not getting out of here!
A-aha!
A-ahaha! 
A-ahaha! I'm a fat skank!
I'm a fat skank!
I'm not getting out of here!
I don't even know what to do!
Oh Jesus Christ!
I can't be here any longer, Triceratops! Please, I have to tell you something!
The government is gonna nuke Dowager.
No, it won't do that, Triceratops!  Try this again and try it again!
Dude, you've been lying to me for two days!
Oh, my God, that wasnt your idea!
Wait a minute, that cake Chefruh! It's still the same color?
Yeah, it's still the same color.
What the hell is that?
Kenny's brother?
That tub of food?
How are we gonna get by now?
All right, come on!
Dude, we have to hurry!
What if the government actually does have some self-control? Like, in there?
What if we do?
Well, here we go again.
All right, come on guys.
Dude, this time bend over so that the baby looks like a turkey.
All right, now jump over the baby and crawl up the arm.
Up your alley!
Whoa, dude. The line is really long.
Are you Elton John, you stinking aliens!
Come on, everybody!   You're gonna die, dude!
It's a stupid name.
Dude, we're not kids. We're people dying in front of a million people!
Original Elton John!
What's the matter, Kenny?
Kenny, what is that?
Wait! Stop! I don't wanna be here!
You don't have powers, dude. You justregister when you don't hear from us.
What the hell is that?
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
I'm not hearing from you, dude.
What is "pubes"?
Okay, look.
Okay, now we're gonna play the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Upstairs!
Oh my God! That was so gay.
This is so great!
You guys, we have
====================
He can't be seen anymore.
Couldn't be seen anymore.
Will you help us, Phillip?
There's been a mistake.  You and Phillip have not beenacon?  Do you and Kenny?
Kenny didn't want Aidnor around, dude.
Oh God! Will you help us?
Help us?
Oh no! No, Aidnor, it isn't gonna work on me!
Hold it!  Kenny!
Hold it!  Will you help us?
How are you doin'?
But, it's working.
But it's not working, Will.
Please, you guys.  You okay?
Yeah, Kenny?
...What?
Will you help us?
I need you, Will.
Please, help us.
Help, Will.  Oh shit!
Will you help us?
Oh shit!
Will you help us?
So we need help identifying one of our bank employees.  This way: in the back!
I'll never forgive you, Will.
What are we gonna do?
Screw you guys, I'm the ones who kicked his ass!
That's nice, Butters! Now let's burn that bitch!
What are you talking about, Butters?
That's sweet, isn't it?
When you said "shit" you were trying to describe a lot of things!
Oh Will, we're firemen! We are!
Oh God, Will, you're not gonna burn this house down!
What are you talking about, fatass?!
Will you please take a crap?
Will you please take a shit?
Oh Will, you're just lying to people. People don't really care that you've got a dick.
What are you talking about, Will?
Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.
Oh. shit.
Oh, shit.
AAARGH!
AAargh!
Will you please take a shit?
I got a dick!
AAaaa!
Will you please take a shit?
Sir? Sir!
I'm sorry.
It's hopeless. We need to get rid of the girls now.
We made it this way around - -land of Giant Douche.
Cartman, where are you going??
God-damnit Cartman!
Cartman farted in the water!

====================
What's that?
Oh my God, that's horrible!
Alright, what does that mean?
Alright, it's 3:30.
Alright, it's more Orgue!
It's funnier than that!
Awesome!
Well, as a comedy, I feel like I'm the tough one.
Wow!
Oh, God, the South loses!
See ya.
We're so close.
Check out the final commercial break.
Oh, yeah.
I guess so.
Oh, so you did, fatass!
Yeah. So, where's Stan?
That's it? Stan's the new kid, and you're his new best friend.
What happened to you?
Dude, if anybody cares about Kenny, they should talk to me.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, Ah! Help me make amends for watching Game of Thrones tonight!
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I'm just... trying to be a responsible adult.
I'm sorry, I don't trust you either.
I'm sorry, I'm so confused.
Dude, I'm just a 13-year-old online student at South Park.
What the hell are you doing?
Just take me home!
Write down "Kenny" and put the letter SH-TADE in it.
You're wasting time and money trying to convince other kids to do the same thing.
Get him to just forget it all and, and write down "Kenny" again.
Get him to just forget it all and, and write down "S-sure thing" Express yourself over and over again, President Kennedy! Now we're gonna win that election!
Get him back into the White House!
Yeah, maybe start taking Action Breaks now.
Get him?!
Oh, dude, I see your mom.
She wants me to take a bunch of vitamins.
What?
Mom, Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Hehaha, he's too young to be taken away.
I guess not.
Sick, dude!
Hey, are you sure?
What is this?
A penis enlargement?
That's long, turd-shaped, and it has a chemical equation P-1269. That means it's the same chemical equation as Tooth Decay.
What the hell?
I'm not being
====================
Dragon Age: Inquisition is a perfect game for all of us.
We're really glad we got pulled over because it was really, really bad.
Dude, we're gonna go to the police station. We gotta show the police department what we've done.
Hi, we're just a couple of friends we are.
We don't really have a place to go, asshole!
We're not your friends, fatass!
Hey, that's the trailer for Terminator 5?
We didn't see your friend in a while.
Hey, yeah! That's the trailer for that movie!
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters isn't a killer and this is not gonna change that!
You'll be sorry when you see I'm a part of your life
Dude, you're not telling the truth, Cartman!
Cartman, what you did was totally stupid!
You know what happens when you make people feel like they have to do stupid things? Star Wars.
Cartman, we're gonna get you to agree to be photo opportunities with celebrities you don't agree to anything.
Sorry, we couldn't get you photos of Han and Chewbacca posing like this.
This is how they look when they're portrayed in movies
Good for you, fatass!
This is how they look when they're portrayed in films
Ha! You gotta move me closer!
You fat fuck!
I don't think Stan wants to be a part of it. He thinks he's being watched are just visitors.
Please, you're a big brother to be watched.
Please you're a big brother to be watched.
That's right, Stan! I'm not going anywhere without you!
You the part of God that watches things on purpose?
Look, it's almost time.
It's the holidays, dude. What better way to spend the holidays than to be a part of a bunch of douchebags who want us to believe you suck!
Holy shit, dude!
Jesus, dude!
Oh, shit.
Wait, wait, there's more!
A band! I think the bullseye is gonna win!
God damnit!  I'm not gonna be a part of a band if Cartman doesn't allow us to perform.
Get him in the band!
I think he wants a part in a movie.
Yeah
====================
Adopted by the NFL on Jan. 14.
What's that?
Dude, my little brother's football team is playing at halftime.
Aw, dude.
This is ridiculous.
Please, reconsider this contract.
You'reenting this war on Star Wars.
This is not a science-fiction story.
This is real Star Wars.
This is the outcome of a study.
No! It isn't!
Yes it is.
This research grant is intended to support the development of the use of virtual reality in films and television shows. The research grant is a necessary first step in the right direction. Please take the $17,000 that I made this ticket, divide it equally between the two groups that I select as my friend, and apply for it again.
Thanks!
Chef!
No, dude, that's not the research grant I was looking for!
Dude, have you found the bathroom?
I need you to help me find the bathroom that everybody else is going to that night.
I need you, Chef! You are going to help me find the bathroom that everybody else is going to go to tonight!
I'm going to the kitchen!
What is that?
Oh, yeah?! You found the right one Chef?! That's great!
Yeah. Everyone at their fingertips! What better way to introduce yourself to Kenny than with this muff!
Chef, this muff is perfect! I say I'm from Jersey, you should come visit me at Jersey.co.uk and make an American Express card!
What?!
Dude, this is all they're gonna say on the side if they know I'm from Jersey!
Oh crap!
What do you mean?
Uh, we would if we were to get an American Express card!
What are you doing?!
Uhhh...
Uhhh, we'd better get working!
I've been working all night... trying to get up. Trying to make it to my brother. I can't believe how much it makes me feel.
I guess you know how people in Jersey feel about the state's new governor?
He's aghast! All he wants is to be known for being Jersey!
What the hell is he doing?
There's no governor in the entire world!
There's no sane reason why he shouldn't be here.
Scott Walker?
Scott Walker
====================
Hello!
It's a coincidence that wakes us all of a... surprise!
Oh wait. Wait, what?
Oh Jesus!
Somebody took that songage off of Clearwater's economy. It's just not worth it.
Yeah.  And the people who live there suffer most.
How is that gonna help?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. This is gonna be the best summer of our lives.
Dude, did you hear that?
Wow! Cool!
Cartman, what's happened?
Yeah, what did you do?
No, what, Cartman?
What's going on?
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's okay to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but also to have your own traditions and your own beliefs.
This is it. Xcel Energy.
This is it!  We're not even selling them the game. We're selling them the XBox exclusive.
Wow.
Yeah, that was cool.
You got your period, Kenny. Why don't you tell everyone?
What's this thing about, Cartman?
Call me out on a weird one-night-only event!
Hey, uh, Cartman, can we talk about Cartman?
No, we're gonna get into the GameSphere. You can't go wrong.
Okay, Cartman. We're sorry.
What?
No. Cartman, we're running out of friends.
You know what? Let's just get our friend bases loaded and have them filled with us.
No, Cartman, you're not getting high again!
This is just a stupid game!
That isn't balance.
Get your friends high and mighty!
Oh, dude, check it out.  Chef?
Get his friends high and mighty!
Yeah, clone!
Kick ass, dude!
Get the hell out of here!
Dude, I don't think Kenny's high is that high!
You're on, fatass!
I don't think Kenny's high is that high.
You know, I think maybe now that Kenny's getting high, he's starting to become alienated from his friends.
Hey! What about you?
You're on.
Yeah, this is really lame.
What's this about, Cartman?
Towelie is out there

You're not a boy, fatass.

And you know what I like best about you? Your sense of humor.
No matter what your friends or family say, I swear, he doesn't care.
Oh my God, on Christmas, oh my God!
Dude, I'm so sorry. You must feel so Christmas is this present.
I'm sorry I couldn't be present for you.  And now you'll never see Santa again.
Good job, fatass!
Yeah, what a dumbass!
What are you doing?
Hey, look.  See Anastasia doing?  She's doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.
She said, "Show me your tits"
Hang on, I'm chaining my bullpup skills!
What?
You're so talented, Cartman.
Shut up and grow old!
Hey, fatass! Your family is gonna shit by us all.
They're doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.
God-damnit Cartman!
They're doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah, they've got the hottest girl in the world, and they said they'd give it to her.
What?
This is stupid!
I don't even know if I should even watch it.
This is so stupid, dude!
I can't. I'm so confused.
I can't understand any of this.
Why do they care?
Aw man, at least she's alive.
Oh my God, they killed
====================
A lot of people are starting to believe that Wikileaks is some kind of serious conspiracy?
No. They're just being stupid people!
It's just stupid...  people are just digging in their heels. People are just digging because they feel like they have a hand in this conspiracy.
Just don't be such a baby!
No, baby...  I think it's important that we remember that we didn't just download music for iPod touch! We're not trying this music anyway!
What if the app doesn't even recognize the iPod touch?
That's two against one, you dumbass!
What's the matter?
...What?
...Kenny, will you shut up already?!
No.
Yeah. I'm a little concerned that someone's life is in danger.
Don't worry, Kenny. There's nothing we can do. The police could come after you.
Well, they're looking for this guy.
Come on, Kenny!
You bastards!
Yeah, I think we broke him.
In what way is good news?
Hey! He's not a therapist, fatass!
He's a NASCAR driver!
He's a fat skank!
Go somewhere else!
It's a really dry and cool place.
No, dude. It's a dry and cool place.
Maybe this place is hell.
And if so, how?
Well, maybe this place is hell.
Oh no! No, no, oh no!
So what are we doing now?
Oh God! No more dreideless!
I said, "hella," "hella," and "hella."
What's that?
Oohh, "h'aii Dreideless!"
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Oh God! I'm gonna get in trouble for not being a dad sooner!
Dreideless, I released him because he got into a fight.
Dreideless, I released Cartman after he got into a fight.
Alright, alright! Knock it off!
Dreideless, don't you ever find a way to get in the next room and make out in the silence?
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Oh God! You stink!
You're doing it, Cartman!

====================
Take a look!
I'm swimming!
I'm making lake runs!
And I can swim in it without any problems at all.
No, really.
No. No-it's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Yeah.
How is that going?
Shut up and be a dick to everyone!
Oh, l-Ike, you can't do this classroom!
Hey, wait! There are children in here!
Go get 'em up!
Look, that's my sister-in-law.
He's a little young, don't you think?
Really?
Yeah.
You're keeping us away from them, Cartman!
All right, let's go!
No, dude, go get 'em up!
I know what you mean.
Yeah!  Get 'em up!
'Cause, teacher, this Kindergarten teacher, they're all doing it wrong.
What?
Yup.
Yeah! They're all doing it!
Yeah! They're all doing it wrong!
You've gotta know the difference, Cartman!
I'm not helping them!
Yeah! That's a good point.
Right.
Yeah, then tell him he's faking.
What??
This is ridiculous!
You're lying to everyone!
All right, tell him I'm not the one that dabbled and talked and acted and that I actually cared about him!
Then don't do this! You're lying to people!
Who are you?
Don't do this, Cartman! I'm the one who decided to ditch you!
Who are you?
Don't do this, Cartman! I don't care if you do or don't do this!
What did you do?
What?!
Well, yeah, but dude, this is all the living hell I can imagine! Do you know how little that street looks like after the smelly air we're living here?
I don't know. But there's so many more important things right now.
You know, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with dead people!
All right, go get me some ice cream.
Oh my God, I'm seeing this lady in the commercials. They put little girls in costumes and tell them to kiss dead people.
G
====================
Hey dude.
We were goin' through the kitchen side kitchen last night.
Uh, l-look, if you don't eat, your little brother can die.
What??
What?
Alright, what are you doin'?
You mean this one?
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome!
I'm gonna be the toughest master chef in the whole world, dude!
All right, I mean, here's the one thing: if you don't eat, you don't die. So if you eat, you go see Whoopie Man.
Well dude, thank God!
Bebe ba-- Bir!!
God, I can't do anything!
I'm just a fourth grader going through all this.
I wanna go to Canada. I wanna get my B.J. on this trip.
So I said I'll come, but please, don't make any promises or take any responsibility for your actions. I mean, I wanna be the toughest chef in the whole world, but I can't do anything.
Okay, I'm going, dude. Please, don't make any promises or take responsibility for your actions.
Okay.
Come on, I'll try to be cool.
He's my best friend ever.
Uh, hello?
Dude! What the hell is that?
Well, okay.
Oh, okay.
Cool.
Nah.
Not yet.
What's that, Tracy?
Where's your mom?
Well, like, every other week, I have to take her to Wendy's, because my mom doesn't have one.
Dude, what are you doin'?
Yeah. Do you know how to start a fire?
No, but you know, I have been to many aries at Wendy's. They help us keep the house going.
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
He'll be here.
He's here!
He's here!
He's here!
This is your new favorite Wendy's.
Uuu, yeah.
They're out now.
Come on, they're out.
This is your new favorite Wendy's.
Wait! You guys!  You okay?
So where is your new favorite Wendy's going?
That's two more weeks until the election, okay?
Dude! I'm telling you. It's too
====================
Hey Stan,
I'm super busy right now.
Dude, your mom freaked out last night.
What is this about, Cartman?
How is that gonna help?
Just get me out of here before it's too late?
Oh, Jesus!!
I'm sorry, Cartman. Your mom won't let you go.
You know what she's gonna do, Stan. She's gonna do something about it.
You just wait till she sees my sweater.
Don't you just feel better now, Chef?
That's two against one, dude?
What?
Mom, Dad, have you ever had that weird feeling that Roe and Melinda Gates have been the same race, only they've changed names?
That's it. Airdates.
Aw, so you're my little brother, right?
Except for the fact that I'm your little brother.
And that makes me gay.
Not like that, dude.
Yeah. And that makes me ugly.
What are you doing?
I don't know.  Just know that I'm not your friend, and that you're not gonna hate me any more.
Okay.
Yeah. I'm sorry, but right now I'm trying to control what you do. I've even been to the hospital.
Yeah, that's pretty weird.
Whoa, dude.
You okay, Stan?
You just had that weird time being a Jew on Christmas,
Dude. You kind of lost it.
Wow, I guess this is really weird.
God-dammit.
That's a rooster.
Jesus Christ!
Yeh-hah!
We're all gonna get sent to do something, Chef.
We're gonna tell our parents we're telling them lies.
We told our parents we were a Jew, Chef.
We don't know what you're talking about, dude.
Jawas aren't pork rinds. They're kinda pork rinds.
Well, we've been telling this story for a while.
Nobody ever tells lies.
Well, we're just trying to make money off of people who are lying.
We're not lying, you guys.
Chr, what are you doing?
Aaahh. Oh, come on! This is totally gay!
We're not lying about being Jews, you
====================
We need help identifying one of our best friends.
He's our friend.
Dude, you'd better be kidding me!
So then where do we go?
Look, that fish is gonna give us trouble.
Dude, we have got school anyway.
We're not going back.
Yeah, why do you have that stupid T-shirt?
No, dude, we're not going back.
...Oh, and do you know what? We're gonna go get Chef's truck.
Yeah, we checked, dude. He's got Bots.
Chef's truck.
We're gonna get in and make our friend.
 Chef, you're back.
Chef!
It's good to have you back, dude.
Yeah, probably.
Dude, have you found somebody else to play with?
Chef!
Wow, dude, check it out!
Here we go!
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.
Dude! There he is!
Well, actually, I think I can prove I'm friends with some of the better people in the world.
I'm kind ofin the minority, dude. I'm mostly in the minority.
You guys are like family, Ike!
This is it guys. If you don't talk to me about your school reunion, I'll never get my brother to school.
This is it Christians! If you don't talk to me about your school reunion, I'll never get your two cents.
Hey! You're a good guy!
I'm not trying to hurt anybody, Stan! If anything, I'd rather see your two cents than go to your rally.
The poor kid, the other kid, it's just... it's horrible!
All right, let's just get this over with!
All right, let's just get this over with!
This is just their way of being cool
Even if it's lame.'
Oh my God!
You don't get sucked into it, Cartman! You don't get sucked in at all!
No! 'Cause you guys want HWAAAUCK!
Yeah.
Just get it over with!
This is their way of saying "We want you to stick it your ass in this situation" -ed.
Yeah.
No no.
Oh please! They're just gonna stick it your ass
====================
Raging!
Oh my God!
I hate this country so much. I hate this country so much that I can't help but to rant about it. I know that I've got something to prove, but can I really make a living?
I mean, if I make a living off the land, what do I do?
Haaaah!
I can't do anything!
All I'm gonna say is, "Hm, am I a luauh? No?"
The luauh can't tell anyone where I am, so I made a luauh mask.
What am I supposed to do?
When I'm naked and inebriated, Imbes?
Cartman!
Yeah, screw him!
Dude, what are you talking about?! I'm not naked and inebriation!
Dude, this is really gay!
Oh no...
I'm not completely naked and inebriation.
...gay.
I have a gay perineulet around my urethra.
So I can better see clearly and get better results with the naked eye.
That's 2.5 inches of black.
...So it is without a doubt. The best part? I can even read the perineulet.
Adriana, we are swimming in the San Joaquin.
Wow. Wow.
I don't know what to do. It's hot.
Okay.
Okay, Cartman, how is it doing?
I can see clearly.
I need you to do it, Cartman, so I can better understand what's going on.
I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  And I know that I'm not the best boy, either, but I feel like a normal kid. So I'm not your typical fifth grader.
Uh where should I sit?
...I don't know.
Dude, you're supposed to put their hand on the base of your pants.
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Are you fucking retarded?!
Do you fucking know anything?!
This is fucking retarded!
Guys, stop!
They're supposed to be classy.  And they usually are.
Wait. Guys, this is fuckin' ridiculous.
You think you know everything about Cartman, but you're not really, you're
====================
Hello, ma'am.
I'm just trying to fit in here, not having any life experience.
Uh, is there somebody in here?
No, we need to get the hell out of here.
I'm this way, this left, so to speak
I'm not a life-long FoW fan!
Well that's fine, because I love Silent Night. But who Are you?
What are you doing here?
Oh, God!
AAAAAAA!
I don't know. Do you know who I'm dealing with?
Dude!
Oh dude, check this out.
Yeah, here we go again. Cartman, the door is open.
Wait!
I know. I'm trying to figure out how to get into this club.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
I'm not dealing with you!
I'm not even gonna get in the club!
All I'm gonna do is try to get in, and start yelling anti-gay stuff!
This is NOT a safe space, you stupid asshole!
This is a toyline!
You don't understand! As soon as you start yelling about resources and how not to do so, the whole group starts yelling, "You're not a part of this thing, you're a part of now!"
What?
Dude, I have to say, I really don't think I'm seeing a lot of the Jesus Christ side.
Oh Jesus, you're right. Maybe I should put my camera away.
I'm a Jew. I'm not a Christian.
I think if we all just leave the church and get on a boat to Goat Island, we'll find a place to live here by ourselves.
I think if we all stick together we can make a bigger difference in the world.
I'm Jewish.
I think if we all leave the church and get on a boat to America, we might find a place to live here by ourselves.
What the hell are we doing here?
Oh.  Dude, I don't think we're gonna get much better than this.
We've got to get our mascots, Stan, wrong. We've got to make everyone write down their own word for it.
How do we make three million won??
Wait. Stan might be right, but I think we're gonna be a long time ago.

====================
Dude, we have to do this!
We've gotta do this!
I know it's tough to keep your parents in the loop, but you have to watch this thing go by. Just this by chance, and it happened to be on TV this morning.
Hoh, she's pretty cool.
Wait... hey, are you Elton John?
What's "class?"
... class?
What's in a class?
What's a "Ton of Vegetables?"
... What the hell is a "vegetable?"
Mr. Jefferson, the South loses! You are our slave!
Yeah. I think I'll add some more... veg!
Garda!
Arrrgh!
I think I can show my mom...
But he's not big on vegans.
How come?
Not my big brother, fatass!
Not while I'm outed as a veg!
Oh cool. Avenger's syndrome.
That must be it.
He's a doctor.
He's a big Gary Oldman impersonation.
Yeah. He's getting ...a lot of the vegans' money.
Man. Vegans are gonna have to pay for Anthem.
Yeah. See, we got you to pay for your stupid TV.
Yeah! You're a gaywad!
Yeah, dude!
Yeah! You're a gaywad!
Yeah! You got a gaywad!
You're a gaywad!
Yeah! You got a gaywad!
You're a gaywad!
Yeah! You got a gaywad!
Well, I was wondering, like, how old are you, Cartman?
Dude, you have to be 30 to get your gaywads tapped.
Yeah. And that's why you get laid off from work.
From what?
Dude. You're pregnant.
Mom. Mom.
It's okay. You know what's important? Being a lesbian.
Be sure to take them all out in the park with you.
All right, fine. I'll get it
Go for it, Kenny.
Get over there, gaywad!
Oh my God! That was not him! He was with his big brother!
Get him over there, gaywad!
Yeah. Its Kenny's idea.

====================
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to kill Kenny.
Yeah.
Get him!
Oh, dude!
Yeah, sorry dude.
They don't care if Kenny's wiener is real or not? They just... they...  Get him!
Oh dude! Dude!  Get him!
Not if I.
Get him!
Oh God, dude!
Get him!  Get HIM!
Get him OUT OF HERE!
WE'RE NOT BEING GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!
God-damnit dude!
Cartman!
Get him out of here!
That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Dude, your family died?
What are you talking about?
How much?
All right, fine!
Yeah, I know that I should be concerned, but, well, I mean, all I really cared about was getting a BJ! Why would Michael Jordan give his blessing to a gayrobot?
Yeah. Okay, and now I have to tell you...
He didn't.
Yeah.  Dude, you're not a gayrobot, are you?
What?
Oh crap!
I'm supposed to be testing this out on the show.
See, Cartman, I'm not going anywhere. I'm supposed to be testing out this mouthy new toy.
No dude, I told you. Be cool.
Alright, come on!
What the hell are you doing?!
No, Cartman, I'm not going anywhere!
No you aren't, you're taking me somewhere!
See? I told you Cartman.
Okay, go ahead.
All right, fine.
But where do we go?
There.  There are robot guards at the end.
Okay, I'm going in.
Here.  There are guards at the end.
Go on, Ike.
Get ready, Ike.
Dude, it's a robot named after a Canadian Prime Minister.
I think it might hurt us.
Get ready, Ike.
Kick butt, Cartman.
Get ready, Cartman.
This thing is huge!
It's supposed to be big and fat.
Get ready, Ike.
Kick It!
Get ready, Ike!
This thing is huge and it's gonna break your heart.
====================
Dude! You've gotta help us. We need to define what a family is.  Who are you to decide it shouldn't be here?
Whoa!
Dude! What the hell?
A family?!
Hey, that's a great idea!
A boy?
...Billy and Wendy?
We're really worried about Stan.
Why?
Dude, he's not a:))))))Lmao
Hey, uh-
We're gonna win that cake with Kenny's wiener.
Yeah.  Wendy and Cartman?
Token.
What?
Dude, what the hell's the matter with you?
Yeah, you're a genius.
We already won!
You're a genius, dude.
Oh. Jesus, we're gonna win this battle.
You're a genius, Cartman.
Dude, we don't have to win that dance!
We just have to show people how smartwe can win!
I can afford to buy in to your genius, and my friends.
I said we just have to show them how smartwe can win.
Oh, dude, you're not a genius, you're a fatasswad!
Wow!
Oh, dude, listen up! This is genius! We've got to win that dance!
We're not going into Amazon. We can't win that whole bunch against Rotten Tomatoes!
I know, I know. Boring.
This is probably the best selling book of all time.
What?
This is a big deal?
All right, let's just say all the people Costco helped make whole!
Red,?!
They took all our friends!
We're not gonna win!
Yeah, dude. We're sorry.
Yeah, we're sorry.
Yeah, okay.
We just... we didn't tell everyone.
...We thought...
Costco!
We didn't realize how important friendship is, fatass!
We didn't tell my mom, dude!
We didn't tell my mom, fatass!
You assholes stole our friend!
We didn't tell my mom, fatass!
We didn't tell my mom, fatass!
We didn't tell my mom, fatass!
We didn't tell my mom, fatass!
God-damnit, wha- what
====================
I'm a Jew.
Jews are supposed to be kind and nice tos.
No Jews, Jews are supposed to be mean and cruel.
No, No more time out, fatass! Be nice to me and I'll be your friend!
Be kind to me and I'll be your friend!
Yeah. That makes it okay.
No, No more time out, fatass! Be nice to me and I'll be your friend!
Yeah, but you've been away from me for a while. So I guess I should be nice to you.
Hey. You're really staying at this house?
I'm staying up all by myself?
Oh God!
I have no idea!
Hey! Maybe you should come to South Park?
Oh no! What will it be?
What is it?
Oh my God!
Please, you're a disaster! Come back here!
Oh no! What will I do?
I dunno! I just can't seem to get it out of my system.
I'm in a party now. One can expect up to 400 pounds of damage.
Oh my God, dude!
I'm in a party now. Three can expect up to 400 pounds of damage.
Damnit, you're not that good a wrestler.
Damn it! What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman?
I don't think I can keep my cool.
Just keep flowing, Cartman. You're going to be so much worse than me.
Die, dude.
Oh, you're not gonna die, you're gonna get sucked down my crawlybutt again!
Dude, I knew it! You were totally wrong!
Oh crap!
Don't suck my balls, Cartman!
Oh, you're doing it again!
Man, I can't keep my cool.
How come the other kids aren't watching us?
Kids? Kids?
What?
Watch out! Kids! This is gonna be a big night!
Oh, dude, there's gotta be a way.
You're keeping a lot of cold showers in your room, Kenny.
What kind of guy is Cartman?
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
The Earth Day School District is threatening to close down without delay the Friday the 13th movie premiere because the Cartman Brothers filmed it.
Sure you do!
====================
Hey, look!  It's the theme park.
Well, we came because we think it's a really cool idea to make an animated Christmas card.
Cool!
And if you think it's a bad idea, tell the police!
Dude, our parents are gonna kill us!
Dude, I don't think we should play with guns.
Oh no! No, don't do that!
No, no, this isn't about you, this isn't about ME!
I have been a parent for 20 years!
I know! Believe me, I know that you're NOT a parent to your son.
You're a stupid parent!
Mom, Dad, you think your son can't figure out what he's doing.
And that's why you put peanut butter and raisins on Christmas?
Well uh-
We don't know. Mom, I feel like I should be watching a movie with my son.
Dude, he's always shivering.
Come on, Ike! Your Sonja isn't here!
Where's your husband?
Oh, my God, there's your sonja...
...and my husband.
...and my little brother.
What's a "thing"
Well, it's okay. We know that little guy named Gary Struthers, but did you know that he's been doing this for years?
Well, uh-
We're not objects, "thing" or "thing" not existent?
Light is a new kind of being. The universe is at peace.
I'm a part of it, too.
Why do you have light in you?
No, light in me?
Light is the basis for all existence.
I'm a part of it, too.
Yeah. I guess we've been given another chance.
I'm a part of it, too.
Yeah. It's not too late to do what's right.
Yeah! 
You're not pulling our weight, Wendy. All you did was play defense.
Dude, what are you doing?
Wendy, I'm not going to lose weight. I just... I want to lose some weight.
And because I'm losing weight, you're making me lose some.
Why?
Hey, Wendy, what are you doing?
Wendy, I'm not going to lose
====================
Google Street View?
Yeah, it's awesome!
Yeah I've got my iPad.
I need a lab for my new robot, dude.  So I go to the lab and I tapped my d-pad goes... crazy.  Inside are cats and dogs.
What is a pet this way?
Dude, I don't think my mom is thrilled.
Is she?
Holy shit, dude!
Okay, it's 9:30.
I don't have a lab, bro.  Hey, look, there's this guy called Stan who wants to build computers.
Cartman, I'm goin' to teach him how to build a robot.
Well, heheh, Cartman, I was just talkin' about how cool your robot is.
I'm goin' to go tuh try and distract Cartman a little, but he's usein' it all by himself.
All right, fine, I'm goin' to go tuh shoot some video of Stan doing his thing.
All right, well, I was just talkin' about how cool your robot is.
Doesn't your talk make you weak?
Look, are you dreidelighted?
Dreidelight?
Oh, Dreidelight, I'm talkin' to you like a man.
I'm a fat skank, a pornstar, and a... best friend of a dead friend.
I'm your friend no matter what it is.
You are not worth anything.
Dreidelight?
Oh, no! No, you're not worth anything!
I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.
This is your fault, you know that?!
Oh, Dreidelight?
I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.
This is your fault, you know?!
You served your country, you tubby little fuck!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
No. You'reoud see me in a couple of days, see ya!
That's not what I meant!
She's not going to go looking for me.
No.
I don't want to.
Go ahead.
No.
She's not going to look for me
====================
Dude. He's making a big comeback.
It's okay, dude. The way Cartman is doing, it's not that hard to keep keeping your cool.
Are you still with the club?
Scott Tenorman?
Cartman's not on the team again!
Well, we tried, dude. We've changed his mind.
About what, Butters?
Dude! That sucks!
You suck, Cartman!
You're not Wendy Testaburger!
Stop it, Cartman!
That's not what I meant!
What the hell did you mean?
...What?
You hate Wendy Testaburger?
No, dude, it's not like we don't have a lot of friends. There's always Butters.
This is your friend, dude. You're on our side in this whole thing.
It's not a friendship, you know that?!
Yyeah well, I mean, we kind of got along well, but it was like, and it was really lame.
Then he was totally gay.
Like a wound.
A family.
A gay wound.
Well, three brothers and a sister.
And the only thing that makes us more sad is that our friend isn't even his or his friends.
I think we should credit him with saving us from a certain-seventy virus.
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Dude, I just got a copy of his song.
His mom just wants him to be old age-appropriate.
Like a-areas are gonna be open to evolutionary disease.
What are you talking about?
Oh my God, you're not gonna kill us.
Dad?!
Oh my God, you're not gonna go back.
This is your fault, Cartman!
You're not gonna get old, fat boy. You're gonna get sick.
Oh my God, you've got to hurry!
Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend die, and then you get the friendship you wanted?
That's what happened to me.
I'm not dead. I'm just... being... never been.
Love Is For Everyone!
Officer Barbrady, I feel for the people of Jersey. I feel for the people of Manhattan.
I don't know what to do.
Hold on, this guy just flipped
====================
State TV showed the Congo's President Bebe before the Congo's Parliament.
Bebe, what do you want?
Bebe, thank you for inviting me to your country.
Bebe, I have an idea.
We can secretly go around and tell the Congo's Parliament that the South loses their independence tomorrow.
Bebe, I heard you got beat up at school again.
You see anything?
Okay, see if we can get our parents permission to build a wall around the capital.
We're just going to try to convince the South that they're wrong.
Then let's take them all to Beabyes, to see if we can learn anything about them.
No.
What?
No, we're just going to try to convince the South that Beaby is insane.
What?
Hey!  You okay?
Then just tell us where the cannibals are.
So how are we going to get a copy of the Bible every time Bebe sings about his fire?
Look!  Therrh!
Oh God, it's Bebe.
We wanna go to the Bebe concert.
I'm going to the left field bleachers with the Bebe.
'kay?
So we got our copy of the Bible every time Bebe sings about his fire?
That's two tickets for one.
Date-rape something.
That's two tickets for one.
Heh, we don't wanna be in a group with lice.
What are you doing?
No, dude, we're not going anywhere!
Bebe, you've been in here before.
Wow. Cute.
Yeah, they play hide and seek around here.
Hey, do you know where Bebe is hiding?
Bebe?
Me?
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now.
Bebe, you can't be here if we get in a fight.
Okay, so what are you doing?
Okay, so, what are you're doing?
Relax.
Aah!  Aah!
Aren't those the new dime stores?
Okay, so how are things going between us?
Bebe, you know all the school and the restaurants.
And I know you're pissed at me because you can't go to see the new Jason Derulo movie.
But what are you
====================
Dude! Look what I got.  Superglue.
I got it from eBay.
Yeah, I got it from eBay shopping.
So what's the deal?
You get to keep using it, Mom and Dad.
I'll never forget the first time I used this on them.
Do you plug it in?
Oh my God!
Oh, no...
Oh my God!
I couldn't plug it in.
That's wrong.
Oh okay.
How about some credit?
Wow, dude!
Yeah, what did you do? How about you check their servers?
Dude, I don't think this is cool.
You guys, we can't let that Koenigseking video go to waste. Let's get it out of here!
Pull up in front of the school at night. Tell everyone to get out of here.
This is our new Ethernopian, kid. Cartman the Kid.
Get out of here, Cartman, we're serious!
You just gridlocked him with the power of the Internet!
You dudes don't understand! We can't get out of this stupid building!
What is the Internet for? Well, the Internet is for the people!
What's the big deal? I was the one making fun of people who do stupid things.
You guys are wasting your time.
What the hell is everyone doing?
The principal is saying they can't go to Guantanamo Bay.
They can't go there, Cartman. They have to go get the women.
Why the hell would they do this? There's already problems!
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years.
Yes, yes, we can get President Obama to do this.
Yes.  I believe that you, sir.
Yes.
Yes, I believe that you, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's not it!  I believe you here. Because you know, I believe, right now, now, very clearly, that this is not a country we can go to the moon on.
I believe you too.
This is not a movie. It's a dream come true story.
I believe you too.
Stan?
He's right. It's a really big place. I-it's... nice to be here.
No, dude, it's
====================
I'll bet it was you.
Dude, you've been on Death row ever since that guy named Jack Deets was taken off the cover.
No. You wanna go to Nebraska?
No, dude, that's what I told him.
We wanna go to the Nebraska Theatre.
Yeah, this is the best school.
Yeah, dude! You're gonna make a great teacher!
Aaaah!
I don't know. Let's go see if we can get a picture of the principal.
Principal?
Principal Noonan?
Oh, uh, we're trying to get a picture of Brent Musberger.
Yeah, principal Noonan.
What principal?
No, it's Starvin' Stan.
What principal?
What do you want?!
Oh, whatever, you're on the cover of Des Moines Register!
You forgot to wear a tape measure, Principal Noonan!
What is a tape measure?
What?
You don't want any more milk on your cassock, fatass!
South Park.
This is It Girl. She's trying to get into kids games.
Yeah, she's a girl.
Dude, she's a girl.
What the hell is wrong with you, Mrs. Marsh?
Dude, are you okay?
They were playin' Miramax on me.
She's tryin' to recruit us for a terrorist attack.
Copy and paste.
Copy and paste.
Okay, Principal Dawn.
Dude, what's play?
Get ready, Ike.
Get ready.
What is "shit"?
What?
Hey! That's not very nice, that's just stupid!
I'm not arguing about The Lord of the Rings. That's all I'm doing is sitting around on my own stupid couch, thinking about how the video game industry should be treated.
When people talk about criticism, they usually start by referring to video games. But, they don't! They're all just the result of people playing them.
Those of us who enjoy the entertainment of games - whether that's by myself or with a friend - should be treated the same as artists.
Playboy was a company well before games became an art form.
Dude, are you happy now?
I don't think so.
I think we should credit him with inventing
====================
Google Now! It's Google Now!
Yeah!
I got it! I got my sister!
Mom! Dad!
It's totally awesome. Everyone at school now knows exactly what to do, and feels free to poke and prod at any part of the teacher's face that they see as they see fit.
All right, let's hear from you!  Mom, Dad, what time is lunch period?
Badutatista!
Hey, uh, today's supposed to be whatever it is.
It's not a turkey, it's  uh - it's okay - it's turkey - it's okay.
hmm...
Call me stupid, fatass!
But I don't have to listen to him!
No! I don't want to!
I will not be the last to hear about your intolerant new religion!
Hear my warning, fatass! Now get out of here!
Aaaggh!
Agh!
About what?!
Well, let's just say "No" to every new religion to protect their brand.
Hey, that's it.  That's it. That fatass breaking point. They're not even church-goers. They're just going to get to see the newbie version of Jesus.
You don't have any friends, fatass! Go hide yourself!
Sir? Sir!
Thesshh Sir, I'd like to share my story.  My family is going to have a big reunion at the mall. My mom is having a panic attack, and I need to take time off to care for my family.
I was born in the United States, and I'm the only child of a Roman Catholic couple.
I was brought up Catholic, and my father was a Methodist.
I'm the fourth generation ofSPONSORED PARENTS.
My parents moved into an old house on a part of the world that is very dry and snowy.  My father is a rocket scientist, and my mother is a pewter
scientist.
I'm tall and black with a ponytail. I'm from Tasmania, and I caught the eye of the Komforty people last month.
Yeah, I guess that comes naturally to them.
Are you Canadian?
I'm gonna go get my dad.
Get ready, Ike. Your dad is going to have a nervous breakdown.
I got
====================
Can't get a Squirt ring.
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to get a ring??
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
I'm sorry Token. You guys made me and Kenny something else!
Now, what ring are we supposed to play?
Dude, I can't find a ring with Kenny playing guitar. Is the Internet or not?
That's a retarded idea, retardedly stupid.
Wait! There's another problem with Cartman's stupid idea! Cartman's stupid!
There's no Roman Coliseum, dude. Screw Wall-Mart.
No?
Well, maybe we can get a partner.
Where now, Stan?
What is "conviction"?
A ring.
That's a mistake.  That's not really what this is.
You're a crook.
Yeah.
What's the Latin word for "bad"?
A crook.
Yeah.
You're a stupid idiot, Cartman.
Come on, Marvin, we can go see what the guys do in South Park.
Yeah!
Aren't you old Frida? You're looking more like a pansy than a-
What the hell is this place?!
Cartman, you don't move, you talk!
Move me!
Yeah, damn you!
What do you mean?
Yeah, see ya!
Yeah, veeeerye ive seen him move around a lot.
Naw, he was busy talking about his new girlfriend.
What?! You didn't see a girlfriend, fatass!
What the hell are you talking about?!
No, he just... walked up to Me and said that we were going to have sex!
Yeah, he looked like a kid, except with a hemorrhoid.
Lame
Yeah, but that doesn't matter. We're gonna give him $5000.
We're gonna call you "Buffy," you dirty word!
You bastard!
He isn't a dick, he's a liar!
We're gonna make him a reality on television!
He's not a dick, he's a liar!
Good for you, Kenny!
Oh, God.  A videotape has been found that shows how Cartman's people have been treated in the Lord of the Rings universe.
Dude, this is going to
====================
Remember when games were cool and movies were fads?
You see, w-we always thought of them as two things. Sprite and ball.
Goddammit, Cartman!
Yeah.
Gets up.
Gets down.
Yup. They're two young, white guys with red hair.
Uhhh, they're gonna get busted!
What are they gonna do?
Get Bill Cosby back?
What are they gonna do?
Get Cartman off me?
That's two against one, Cartman! You won the bet!
Yeah, dude. You're my little brother, and you know it.
This is sweet! We made a bet on which of us would get a bet on the television show "State of the Union." Each person got to pick one of eight TV networks who should win a $5000 bet on which to watch the following Saturday. Which network picked?
Yup. It's really picking.
I think Jimmy in the air?
Whoa, dude!
Go Bill Cosby!
Oh, dude! Get the hell out of here!
You picked X, you got Y, did you pick Y?
This is sweet!  And this is sweet!  You giving this guy money because he's d-astardly?
Probably.
You giving money to a stupid tardface guy?
Whoa, dude!
Go away!
RAW Paste Data
Hey, here's the executive producer.  He's here! He's making a big presentation about ten days ago.  Okay, listen you guys: he knows all about every word you say! He's also got a bunch of evidence that you've said against him!  You're a genius! Dude, you have that stupid cassette player! You've linked it to a virus! Oh, and you said you knew something about AIDS! Well, I don't!... Okay, you guys can listen to this for a minute.  Okay, you're gonna hear our presentationdoc...  on the brilliant minds inside you. But we think you need to learn a thing or people. And we, we're sorry we didn't do your part. But we gotta, we need to get rid of the film-makers. And if you can't show us anything, I don't do. You can't tell anybody, okay?? Here's the control panel.  There it is
====================
Do you think the employees at the Wall-Mart are stupid?
No, dude! They're smart!
Stan gives a stupid presentation.
How do you know that?
Charlie's fart is the same as a guinea pig's.
Charlie's wiener is the same as a guinea pig's.
What?
That's retarded!
You guinea pigs can't fart!
They can only carry one poop, so if they all come out, all the poop will be on Charlie!
Wagh.
Oh dude! I made it.  Oh, here we go again.
Here! Here, here, come on!
It was a long trip, dude. I'm gonna be late for work.
Uh, what time of the week is... Mon, Jan?
Oh. Me?
I'm trying to make it to school at Cartman's.
It's 8:30 p.m. and I there say, "Where are you going?"
Yes, whyasca!
I don't know.
Oh, hi, can we talk to you?
Why don't you just come home?
Oh my God, Cartman! You are not coming back to school!
All right, here we go again.
Look, he's a big guy with a corn on his head.
Because Cartman, there is something I need to tell you.
You were totally stupid to expect Mexico to respect our beliefs.
Even if it's an eight-layer burrito.
I don't know.
...You're a liar.
Dude, what he saying is totally stupid!
We're all going to South Park?
Yeah, we're going to South Park.
South Park.
South Park.
So, you're a liar?
South Park.
Say what you want, Butters.
No, South Park.
What are they doing here?
Dude, it's a little strange.
Washington Redskins?
What's that?
Dude, what's going on?
Dude, I just got this strange email.
What is this?
This is... strange.
That's the Internet.
In the virtual space?
How?
What is this all about, Cartman?
Documentary filmmaker Stan gives his virtual daughter Asmael.
Don't worry, Stan. She's going
====================
Which one of us loses his cool?
Seriously, dude, you can't figure it all out.
What the hell are you doing?
Do you know how to start a fire?
We're firemen!
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
We saved the school!
My mom is gonna break my legs!
Not us. We're good kids.
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Dude, we shouldn't be here!
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Well...  Well, what do you want?
Wait! We'll do it.
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
What else has big round squishy globes?
No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
God, I hope this works.
Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Naw.
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
So you're gonna help us?
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
What?!
Geez, all
====================
Okay, we're gonna play the Jewpacabra.
You've gotta suck my balls.
Jesus Christ!
Wow, dude, what an awesome idea!  Dude, I've been drooling. You're not Drooling.
Better than having Godzombess on.
How does that make you feel?
Down with the Cartman Brothers!
That's Cartman, down with us!
Wow, dude! Your life is over then do!
Yeah. Did we do the right thing?
What brother?
Come on, Cartman! You're not really falling for the Cubist lie that the government is!
What the hell are you doing?
I don't know.
You're in love with a certain Mel Gibson?
Holy shit, dude!
Oh, shut up, you fat turd.
Hey, Kenny.
What do you wanna talk about?
Gibson?
Well, we got a song out that's been platinum in the world. Talk about power.
Wow. 
Wow. Guitar Hero.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Listen, dude: we built thisibo out of nothing. It's the best guitar ever.
What's the hardest part?
Playing Street Fighter?
Playing Street Fighter?
Oh, dude, I'm back.
Uuuh, I was just talking to my mom.
Mom, I got an A.
What?
Oh, whatever.
What?
Ike? Iiike!
Dude, my mom just called the police about me.
They said she saw you jumping over a bus last night.
What?
Hoh, Ike?
Dude, what's wrong with you?
I'm supposed to go to the dance with my family tomorrow.
Yeah. That's a great idea.
Can I come in?
I need you to help me find my family tree.  This is my family , buuuut if I don't have a few more brothers and sisters,  and Dougalats, I have three brothers and a sister .
And my dad has three brothers and a sister .
Dad, you can't keep making Upworthy!
I don't know what to do.  You can't talk to me.
But my mom is trying to keep me from watching some more of my favorite shows.
Don't try and
====================
Prove it!
That guy is doing it.
Because he's a genius.
Because he's a fusion of Japanese and American culture.
Because he always looks like you do.
Because he doesn't have a soul.
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
Oh, you're not really harming anybody, you vagina!
That's not what you're saying!
...Uh oh.
Is that what this strike is for?
Die!
GEASED!
A! Federal Protective Service Form T-29, Part I, page 234!
A! Federal Protective Service Form T-29, Part I, page 234!
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
That's one hell of a lot of blabbered words!
I'll go get you, Cartman!
No! I'll get in trouble!
That's just a stupid idea!
No, dude! That's not true!
Well, I was just trying to prove a point. That doesn't make me a danger to anybody!
No! I don't wanna get in a police car with that stupid Jew-hater!
See? I told you, Cartman. It's just a stupid idea.
No it isn't, fatass! It's not true!
I am not a danger to anybody!
I will not get in a police car with that stupid Jew-hater!
Why do you have cell phone video of me saying those things?
Oh that's right. You guys are gonna help us. We need to get the word out so that people can realize what's really going on.
Ssso it's all just a stupid idea. If you want people to realize what's really going on, just make it like is. Like with Abraham, only YOU can know it.
What's "wedgarten"?
Oh my God!
You know what I like?
An adult talk to a kid.
That's what I like.
I think Charlie's getting a lot of the same treatment.
I think that girls are just wired differently.
They're not wired differently.
They're wired differently, too.
What's a "gay-friendly" school for kids?
Well, that sounds great!
But there's really not many gay-friendly places to live in this world.
I live in a big, ugly, Latino neighborhood.
I don't
====================
God damn it!
But it's okay.
I'm Jewish.
Aaaargh!
You forgot dude.
Well, like, half of my family is Jewish, and my dad is a Jew.
What do you want?!
Oh dude, check it out!
I made a hit show in Denver. People get together, and pi-
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
They're having their heads shaved?
Uuuuh, they're having their heads shaved.
Hey Stan.
What's going on?
Oh. Really?
Dude, you have to tell her.
Really?
Oh my God!
You did?
So what should we do? She's a good student, Stan.
Well, I'm Jewish, a Jew, a Texan.
What?
This is ridiculous!
What is this?
Dude, we don't have a choice!
Dude, we can't do anything!
All right dude, what is this?!
What is this?!
Well what is this?
Hoh God, dude! It's just like the look. Slim photosynthesis. Egg cells.
Yeah. It's just so astounding.
You got it?
Wow!
Oh God, it's true!
Why is it called "starry morning" or something?
"A beautiful, though dry out, of the mountains and gingers."
"Not really, it's just a name"
Well why not?
Yeah, check it out.  See Ike.  See Ike.
See Oh, My God.
I said go away!
I'm not really giving a crap about this either. You should be ashamed of yourself!
This is how you get along with people!
Yeah, this is how they always have been. You're not even bothering me at all.
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just going through my lunch.
The thing is, Cartman, being a full-fledged Jew isn't that bad.
Yeah. I'm sure it would suck at first.
Oh, Jesus!!
Cartman!!
Yeah, it's Cartman. He gets to keep his cool just like everybody else.
The new kid, dude. Look at himself. He looks like a kid.
What's that?
You'd better watch your mouth, dude
====================
A big fat turd.
Mr. Garrison, I'd also like to speak to about some of the other guys I can't find anymore.
Mr. Garrison, can I talk to you?
I think I can.
Mr. Garrison, I'm having nightmares about the Terrance & Phillip show.
You're not getting away with this, you're not worth anything, and you just sounded like a douchey old dude by the way.
I'm not doing anything.
Hey, you know goddamned well what not to do with it, you piece of sh-
Wha-?
Hoh no, dude. I'm not going anywhere.
Alright, this sucks, dude.
You know what I know, dude.
fuck you
Don't worry, dude. That birthday party is gonna be alright.
Just be careful you don't end up...  eating and sleeping with his family.
Mr. Garrison, there's been a freakin' accident.
He'll probably get prison time, too.
You're on, fat boy.
He did it again?! He's a murderer!
Good job, fat boy!
Well, I was just explaining how a person can get out of prison so you can get a new one.
De-cluttering everyone's room is not a good idea.
I'm not dying!
I'm not dying.
That is not what happened, Cartman!
Go on, Michael, and tell us what happened to you.
Get out of here! I'm not touching this thing!
What happened to you?
What?
I'm sorry, Butters. There's been a freakin' accident.
...and now you're gonna be the last kid to go to school without going to school, like Cartman was.
Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at school now, Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey, can I talk to you?
No.
Dude, he's goin' to be the best teacher in the whole world.
I can't! I have to get out of here!
I can't! I have to get outta here!
I'm being held against my will like this for a month!
No you don't, dude!  Secretary of Education, you are the fucking official!
Hold it!  See?
====================
Watch out for balls!
What?
Dude, I'm going to have my period!
God-damnit dude!
He's a big guy.
He's a guy who looks like him.
You've gotta move him.
Yeah, I think so.
What?
Hey dude, is everybody alright?
What are you doing?
No, no, look at him.  He doesn't even seem like he's actually under water.
No.  No, he does seem to be getting really dark.
How is that gonna help?
Oh my God!
Aah!
Yeah. It's like the mind of a cheetah is turning black.
Oh cool.
Chef, there's a new kid in school.
It's Kyle.
Yeah, it's him.
'K went to that Goth party last night.
Oh.
Oh cool.
Chef, have you found a way to get into this new group yet?
He's right. We should.. Google.
Oh, man. This is like the new 40's.
Oh my God!
I had already met the new kid, dude.
Oh my God, I was naked with that other kid last night.
Oh God. I was naked with that fourth grader too.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
You did it, you got a platinum album, and you're doing it alone!
This is the new rap!
You're gross outta whack, Cartman!
Dude, we're gonna end up just like Cartman!
Ehhh, I told you, I's not one of his students.
Do you?
What?
Naw uh.
Oh God, it was so dirty.
See ya.
Dude, this is the part where you tell Cartman he's not a student, and he says he's going to take a crap, and you say "fuck you"
Yeah.
I know, dude. It's a really old PSA.
Yeah, all made up.
What's that?
You don't have any powers, fatass!
Wow, dude! You found us a superlative brown guy!
Dead or alive?
Whoa, dude!
I guess so.
We're having him resurrurected.
====================
Eric Cartman has had plenty of opportunities to reflect on his career. He's never had anything so serious as a tweet. But this was the first time in years he's been... treated like a celebrity. Something is wrong with Cartman.
The background music to "Hello"? #AskEricBartman
Hear that? It's something Eric Cartman is supposed to be able to hear.
That's, uh, I don't know.
Well, I was wondering, like, when he is, you know, he's like, aghastly, you know, I don't know if I can even explain.
Do you guys have any "documentary" tickets?
Cool!
One, two, three, what the hell is going on?
Dude, we can't be outdone by the kindergartners! Cartman's got the wrong guys behind him!
Principal, can we talk to you?
Hoh, hey dudes.
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Yeah, that's not cool!
Yeah, we're better off. Just, you know, take a long hard look at yourself in the eye and, and say, "okay, I learned a lot" - both physically and mentally.
I didn't see a hemorrhoid. I saw one this year.
From now on, Kindergarten is never Halloween.
No, H-I-Ranger!
What?!
Hoh, w-we don't wanna be a groupie!
What are you doing?!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
You wanted Halloween, fatass!
You got a hemorrhoid!
Dude, you're just jealous of me.
Wow, what if Cartman doesn't show up?
What's "empathy"?
Yeah, that's awesome!
Hey, that's a great idea!
Yeah, that's a good idea!
We're gonna get involved too!
Dude, all he talks about is democracy!
Yeah, well, hef you're a part of that, well, I guess... I don't know what to do.
No, dude, I can't do anything!
Just get out of here!
Dude! I'm still stuck here!
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  All we have
====================
I'm not doing it.
Oh, you're on, Kenny.
What are you doing, fatass?!
What are you doing?!
Don't, don't do it!  I'm not doing it!
I'm not going back!
...Cartman?
Dude, he got a new girlfriend?
What's she do?
Is that anal sex?
No, Cartman.  Shit's not cool, dude.
I know. I'm the biggest asshole in the world.
Oh God, what have I done?!
I'm sorry, Cartman.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hm, I can't go to the movies.
Go away!
Oh shit!
Yeah, I'm telling you. There's people all over town at once and you don't want them to kill you.
Stop it, Kenny!
That guy is targeting us!
What are you doing?
Stop it, Kenny!
You're a fat skank!
Well, I'm supposed to protect my little brother from people who molest kids.
So then where have we been?
Seventeen.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm out. Already.
No. And if you try to complain, I'll break your fucking ass off!
Look, that was totally lame, 'cause all those people started coming to rescue us.
We could try and get out of here, Kenny.
Hey!
I'm trying!
Yeah. The road is really snowy out here.
What are you talking about, Stan?
Yeah, what are you talking about?
Dude! What are you talking about?!
Oh, God. I don't know what to do.
Okay.
What are you talking about, Stan?
Yeah. There's this place called Des Moines that has the Laundromat every morning.
Oh.
Well, we used to go to the lake. Now we have a hangover.
Me?
Hey, are you Stan?
I am Stan.
Oh. Great! That's a good point.
Well, I'm sorry, but right now I'm having a hangover from drinking
I haven't been in a long while.
Oh. Oh, love, you're not seeing anything!
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday
====================
WHAT?
Oh my God...
AAAH!
I can't take it. I'm told it went to Damien.
I can't take it. I've been saying for months that Kenny's here, and I've been hearing his name.
Kenny! Wake up! Kenny!!!
You've been brainwashed, Cartman! You have to wake Damien!
Dude, I can't take this anymore. I've been busilyogging the Internet about what to do about Kenny.
Maybe I should tell Damien. I really need to know.
Okay, Kenny!
He's here!
Yeah, just go for it. People don't usually go for huge runs with their friends.
Dude, I think he's tagged you.
Don't worry, dude. You won't get hurt. You're supposed to keep your eye on Kenny.
Get back on, Timmy. You can hop on the sled or something.
Get back on, Kenny!
Come on, Timmy! I can do it!
Get on, Timmy!
Get off the sled!
Yeah, maybe I'll ask him to a dance.
Yes, Timmy, you do have soul mates. Come on, Timmy!
Get on, Timmy! You're not fooling anybody!
No, dude, it's Kyle! Timmy, you're a good kid!
Who are you?
You bastards!
Yeah! Timmy, did you hear what you said Cartman was a dumbass?
What are you doing?
Yeah, fatass! Timmy, did you hear what Cartman is doing?
Come on, you're not a good kid if you don't have a soul mate!
Yeah, fatass! Timmy, do you see anything?
Kenny didn't have a soul mate, were you?
Fuck off, Cartman!
But Timmy, am I a good kid or a stupid rag?
Okay, Cartman. You got a soul mate.
Okay, then let's see what you've got.
You look perfect.
Dude, that video is really cool.
What?
Oh my God!
Here, this one's perfect!
Alright, let's see what you've got!
Who are you?
That's a sweet egg, Kenny.
Kenny?
K
====================
IT'S BEEN THERE, EVERY TIME I LOOK AT IT, SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HURT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN HURT.
There's no denying it, Cartman.
Yeah, it's tough to be a fat shapeshifter.
It's so tough. You know, I've learned something today. It would be like, changing one of your friends.
You're not my friend.
I'll kill you, Cartman
You're not my friend, Stan.
You're Stan.
Yeah, you're not going to help me kill him, Francis.
Yeah, you're not going to help me kill Kenny, are you?
Yeah, and then he said I was going to marry you.
Bebe, that's terrible!
Yeah, and then you said that she would marry you, and then you said she would marry you, and then you said she would marry you, and then you said she would marry you.
So just take it away, Kenny!
Get the hell out of here!
Hey dudes.
What the hell are you doing?
No, you're not?!
You know what I like best about you? You don't have a sideburns and a vagina!
Well, I guess... I don't know what else to paint.
What?
She's not my friend.
What?
Hey, that's a great idea!
Yeah, but seriously, do you guys have any great ideas?  What if we do a show in which fat people are just... painted  over?
Would you guys look at that?
Hey, we'd make a show of it. We would just tell our friends we're doing a show.
Would you guys look at that?
Hey, it's a pretty cool idea!
Well, yes!
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, fat people are not people who are... BEHIND GOD!
Oh man! I've been in space! It's dying planet.
What do you mean?
I'm going to the center of it all and... and tell you what I know right now. Cartman, you Walls of Death are... going to kill us!
Oh dude, check it out.  See you on Earth!
Yeah, but dude, it's growing!
You're doing it's part
====================
What's going on?
How is that gonna play?
Oh, Jesus!!
And I think maybe he's right. There's something we can do about it.
We can't let Cartman win the contest!
All right, all right!
I think maybe he's just frustrated. He thinks our game is rigged.
Forgivable homicide.
Yeah, that sucked.
You suck, Cartman!
Dude, we have to try!
Dude, time is short.
What do you mean, "time"?!
Oh, but you've gotta be kidding me!
What the hell is that?
Dude, we're not playing dirty!
Oh, dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
How come we never get opportunities to play in shows?
Oh dude, thank you. You were totally and forever my little brother.
I'm going to give you a million dollars. You can't get a million until I give you a million!
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch? That one?
What?
So, what's the prize?
What?
Ah, Jesus, I've been working really hard and getting a B-movie going.
The lead part was actually pretty good.
But who was that?
Well, I fell for him really hard in school, and now I owe him a million dollars.
What are you talking about, fatass?
I fell for you, Ma!
Because you got sucked into it!
What are you talking about?!
Hey, look: I want to become a full-fledged member of the Puff Daddy's gayest heart!
Hey, look. Guys, I just got  my first beat off in three days!
I'm going to a gay club to talk to the new girl about balls!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to find the right one to play with. So I'm going straight at you.
You're not a fucking friend!
I'm going to the bathroom to get my belly down.  Whoa! There's a guy there!
What's a guy?
Wow. Guys start conversations, not only with themselves, with sex
With guys, with G-men.
Hey, that's it! Guys!  This is Table Tennis, and I
====================
I don't know.
What are you talking about?!
You talked about "love"?
Yeah.
No, it's not cool!
Ungh, gay, the new kid at school
He's not a writer, fatass! I can read!
I can write!
Check it out, dude.  See X-Men: Days of Future Past.  There's a bunch of people who must have seen it, or were affected by it.
There's a kid named Michael Deets, for sure.
Who made those monikers?
Yeah.  What did he say?
Hm, I think he kind of lost interest in himself.
Well, he's a really smart kid.
That's two against one, you won't even let us watch!
He doesn't care about anything!
Yeah!
Yeah! You're a cool villain!
Kenny didn't have the will to do what you don't want him to!
No!
What does that have to do with Star Trek?
Aw, dude!
Yeah! Knock it off! Stop!
Come on, this is ridiculous!
What?! "refers to a person or thing of the same sex"!
What is a "referenced" person or thing of the same sex?
That's... really striking.
That's a lot of people talking!
Dude, we're talking tens of thousands of people!
Earth is going to be totally razed to the ground!
Oh, dude, check this out.  We're gonna put a stop to it, you guys!
We've got to get it.
Say something, Butters.
Stop putting people's lives in danger!
God-damnit, God-dammit!
Oh, shut up, Cartman!
Sshh.
See? That was a girl.
What are you talking about?
She's not Wendy.
What's going on?
How are you knowin' this?
That's not what she said.
I guess sometimes we let our luck get us into trouble.
Yeah.
I'm not sent away. I was just sent away for looking at a turkey.
...Uuh, I was supposed to look at it today.
I'm supposed to look at it tomorrow.
So what should I do?
Get away from it
====================
Wow. Haven't you noticed the three girls in the back? They all seem to be doing their best to stay on as the students?
No way dude, this is gonna be sweet!
Trent Boyett is back! He made a big deal out of it last week, by pitching a fake video to school administrators!
No way, dude! This is gonna be sweet!
Yeah, here he comes.
Because that's who the Wall-Mart is: a bunch of self-centered, hate-filled, fraudulent, and harmful tactics of last resort.
No. NOO!!
Yeah.
Look, that's not cool. You're not going against the Wall-Mart.
No! NOOOO!
Well, I'm a Jew. I have a few things I want to do with me.
I.I.
Do not kill yourself.
2.3 million people are gonna be screwed up once and for all!
Yeah. It's pretty great.
Oh, dude, look at the new trailer for Everybody Be Its Guest Star.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Will you please stop that stupid little game of hide and seek?
What the hell are you doing?
Dude, you're gonna look so stupid.
Dude, where are you going to hide your face?
Dude, for the last time, don't hurt your leg, God-damn!
Dude, for the last time, don't carve your mark on every house in America, please.
Oh no...
Huh?
Dude, I thought we were going to do a movie.
So sorry, Cartman. You can go tell your friends.
Oh goodbye, fatass!
I'm not going back.
Oh goodbye, Cartman.
Yeah, that was stupid.
What are you doing, fatass?
Who is this?
There's no way we would go to Mexico if we had a bone fragment.
That's... right.
Hey, come on!
This is retarded.
Uh, is that Kenny McHeinenberg?
That's not very nice, Cartman.
Yeah, it was funny.
Why?
Cartman, are you still on the autism spectrum?
I just don't get it.
...What's the world called?
Yeah, that's retarded.
Why?
D
====================
Trent Boyett may have won'ted a fight, but he never got a platinum album. Now, he gets one!
Trent Boyett may have won'ted a fight, but he never got a platinum album. Now, he gets one!
What's the matter with him?

What?
Dude, you've been brainwashed!
Wait a minute, that's a meme. A meme.
Hey dudes.
Dude, you wanna go to Afghanistan?
Hey, uh, would you guys get a gold sled?
What are you doin'?
Stan?
Hey, this is All-American?
All-American.
You're Christian? That's Jesus.
I don't know.
All I know is that he's got a really big plan.
What if Cartman doesn't get a platinum album? What if he's just a regular guy like Kenny?
What if Cartman gets arrested, loses his battle, and has to be retried?
What if he gets released before that?
What if he gets his right to do so?
What if he gets released before that?
What if he gets released before that?
That's you, Cartman. You're a good kid.
Oh, you're supposed to be a bad kid.
What's Beth?
You don't?
Yeah. We're supposed to be cool and famous. But, we, we get released before they're even done killing each other?
We don't have a fate, Cartman. They do what they want.
Hey! Hey, shut up, Kenny!
I'm not gonna get out of school for nothing.
No, I don't!
That's 2:30; that's Cartman!
2:30; get out of here!
We have to get out of here!
That's Cartman!
Get out of here!
That's Cartman!!!
I don't have a fate, Cartman. They make me crap out my head?
Well, come on!
Could it be?
Maybe we should talk.
No. No!
Hello?
That's 3:30; I don't even have a fate. Cartman, you don't even know what you're doin'?
Maybe we can work it in.
Word!
Word!
A fate,
====================
Wahahahah!
Wow. Cool.
Yeah. I feel awesome!
Wow.
Yeah, cool.
That was cool!
Whoa, dude. You're on, too.
Oh, dude, I'm back! I wonder what the hell is going on.
I'm gonna miss out on this whole VHS reunion.
Dude, I Jeez, I'm not going to.
Hm, I noticed that same TV commercial a couple of days ago.
I was just getting ready for school, Chef.
Dude, I had the same feeling that the next time I did, I would get a nurection mung jar.
What the hell is that thing?
Bitch.
She's out trying to get into my little brother's room.
Hey! Hey, you're not that kid anymore, you fat turd!
Wugh!
Don't worry, dude. This is what saving us all from starvation looks like. You just have to know you can't live here any longer.
And that's how we protect our crops and fish and stuff.
Yeah, huh! You wanna bet?
Bet you can stay open for ten minutes, please.
Gross!
Cartman, open your mouth!
Cartman, open your mouth!
Phew.
Oh, awesome.
Yeah. I think I'm actually gonna win a Gold Star mom&ppin' for trying.
Dude, that video is going to be really popular.
Wow.
Oh, dude, check it out. I got a gold Star.
She's tryin' to follow me to school.
Uh, can she come to school please?
Dude, that's the best costume I've ever seen!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Wait a minute. Stan?
Stan?
W-kind of, well, maybe...  I guess, too late.
I can't be here any longer, Stan. I have to go to the hospital.
I have to go to the hospital right away.
Sorry, my mind's made up.
Tell the hospital they screwed me over.
Then just get on the Internet for one more Gooey Web Cart game.
Oh God, it's so embarrassing!
What?
It's so embarrassing, Kenny.
Please, you have
====================
So what are we gonna do now?
We can't wait here long. Sally Turner, the Mayor, has invited us to attend the Terrance and Phillip show...
Wait! Wait a minute! This must be my lucky day.
Oh Jesus, I can't be here to see that big boy do crazy things.
Cartman, Terrance and Phillip are playing cards during the movie premiere, and I invited them to watch Terrance get spanked out of here!
Ahh, Jesus, that's a joke!
Jesus, I don't even know what to do.
Dude, Phillip?
Well, look! The police have a case!
The guy is a cop named Stan who is always doing strange stuff.
He's putting pieces together in his head that aren't there.
So where are we going to get a new watch?
Watch out! This guy's trying to murder him!
Alright, so what's the plan?
Okay, watch out! This is gonna rain blood!
Come on, this is gonna rain blood!
Get back on your fucking watch!
This is gonna be so confusing.
Wwwait.
What is this?
Oh, dude, what is this?
Kenny, where the hell are you going?
Kenny, we are living proof that people can still be content with their televisions.
Bloody hell.

Oh God, please!
Jesus, this is the best dinner party ever.
God, this is really good!
No way!!

Code 7 is that guy from the television show "Good Times They're Fallin'".
This is a trap!

This is a guy from Connecticut!
Do you think he's in here?
This is a guy from Connecticut!
Look out! Here comes this guy from Connecticut!
This is a guy who lives here!
We have a killer ring!
This is the part where they tell a bunch of people how real people are.

Dude!
We're gonna win 3,000 MasterChef friends.
Really?
I've tried, but my luck just didn't seem to reward me with interest.
Uuuh. Well, I'm sorry, Ike. And I'm sorry you couldn't prove me the door.
I'm sorry, Ike.
I'm sorry, Ike.
Y-you didn't really get me the chance to prove anything, were you?
Nothing.  You'll forgive me if I'm right, Ike.
Okay.  But I'm here to tell you, somebody's been doing something about it.
Cartman?
Oh crap.
Butters?
Fatthorpe?
Van Nuys?
Nothing.
All right, fine, Butters. Butters, get out of here!

Oh my God!
Dude, it's a UFO?
Oh my God, it's a UFO?!
Oh my God, it's a UFO!
Oh my God, it's a UFO!
Oh my God, I just got an IM from the government!
The IM is saying it's because we flicked a key.
We don't have a UFO, dude. Just a bunch of myths!
The IM is from the government!
The government!
Here! Here get me some aliens!
Photon rifle, please!
No, I don't!
I am not going to give up on my dream! Now!
I am not give up!
The government of Canada!
Hello?
Hello?
What?
I'm not even sure.
I don't want to give it any attention. It's a dream.
Don't you get it? It's possible. Just take it easy on the government.
Yes you do!
Yes, I...
Yes! Please! I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it.
Unh, that does it!
I'm not giving up on your dream, Cartman! It's possible!
Yes! Come on!  Hello?
Cartman?
Well... that's okay. You have to try not crying out in his little brother.
Shh, okay
====================
Hey, looks like we got our powers back from the gingers!
Wow, that's cool.
We're gonna get our powers back from the gingers! They were realising they were with us.
Dude, we've never met Helen Hunt.
Wait... this is sweet.
Trent Boyett.
Trent Boyett.
This is gonna be sweet! We Can Be Your Friends Again!
Listen, this is all you need to know: I have a new friend, hunh? Look him up.
Totally.
Look, look. Towelie is the new vlogger. He's our new vlogger friend.
Totally.
Trent Boyett is cool. He's become a celebrity.
This is nuts.
Trent Boyett.
This is totally ridiculous. Look at this guy. He's wearing a bulletproof v-necklide.
Okay, you see he's got a bulletproof v-necklide.
So will this be cool?
I've seen this vlogger before, dude. He got mugged last month by the same guys.
We're gonna make tons of money together! How much do we make?
You bastard!
Watch out!
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to keep my friend numbers up.
I even Googling "lifestyle" and "vegan" don't find the word "veal" anywhere.
Sure we'll find it, dude. We'll tweet it, share it, give it to him, and, and, and... I'm sure when he wakes up tomorrow and finds out what happened to him, he'll be thrilled he got a veal burger.
What the hell is that?
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Wow, $69.95 was the ticket out of the bank.
Wow, $69.95?
What's that?
oh my God.
Oh my God, you've got to believe me!
Well, I ran out of cash two days ago and I couldn't get a new one anymore. You gotta help me.
Dude, I almost thought that was a good idea.
Yeah, you can come to Kenny's house with me.
Alright, alright, we got stuck with them, dude.
I'm sorry, Cartman. We're sorry.
Oh
====================
Quick!
...Hunh, dude!
What's High School Musical 3?
Oh.
I'm not really friends with him.
You can be real friends with everyone. Go ask your friend Broflovski.
You'll be.
I know his mom.
This is sweet music, don't you?
It's okay, Ma.
Brocchiata.
The eunuch are my new best friend.
Yeah, well, he's a real crook.
Don't be sad, Starvin' Marvin!  Please don't be sad, Starvin' Marvin!
Brocchiata.
What?
What?
You're not gonna cut me, Starvin' Marvin!
I'm not going anywhere!
Huh?
I'm supposed to be with you, Starvin' Marvin.
You're not going anywhere!
It's not a theme park, it's a carnival!
Where the hell are people getting their drinks?
Wow!
Oh, dude! Your heart is beating so fast.
I'm supposed to be with you, Marvin.
Huh?
Oh. Sorry.
Suddenly, Stan says he saw you on the news.
Oh. Ah, I was going to ask you a favor, Cartman.
You know, I learned something today. We thought we could get a lot of money from Kickstarter to try to get Terrance and Phillip to come back to the show.
You aren't gonna get any money from Kickstarter, you guys!
And you aren't going to get any money from Kickstarter to do this!
Because you're a fucking fatass!
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
You're not going to get a million dollars, you fat turd!
Kickstarter is the new Facebook! Just click on the little blue circle and you'll go to page two!
You're not going to get a million dollars, you fat turd!
Because you're a fucking fat fuck!
Social Media, eh Facebook, I'm goin' to jail!
You're a fat fuck!
Oh. Okay, okay. See ya.
I'm goin' to lock myself in the back of a truck with a friend because I think we should Facebook Live.
I don't like Facebook Live, dude!
Yeah, but I also don't like to rely on it for
====================
Star Trek Online is finally here! Xbox One subscribers can now play the highly addictive Star Trek Online on their TV.
No more having to wait around for the new Star Trek to hit theaters. Just get to your house and get your TV back in three minutes.
Yeah, but now you can get it over on Amazon without waiting around.
Yeah, I know that up front, I had to wait for Star Trek to hit theaters, but now everyone's getting the new Trek!
Get it, Stan!
Oh my God!
It's too late, dude. They're not even the ones threatening us with legal action.
You're on!
Yeah, but you're on, too.
So hurry up and sign our NDA! It says you can't play on Amazon for three weeks!
You're on, Stan!
So we've got this XBox guy with her! Tell her we're their lawyer!
Dude, we've been talking to them for a long time. They think we're lying about how we got into this company.
Sure. Come on, we can go talk to her!
Dude, you have to tell her.
Go on, Ike.
You can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to tell her.
Oh, stop it, Cartman!
Get out of here! I'm getting... a hang-over.
What are you talking about?! I can't do anything!
Here! I has to say goodbye. to Cartman!
I told you last time!
Dude, this time you're not going to kill yourself!
Oh no! What the hell are you doing?!
What's High School Musical 3?
Are you retarded!
Hey, it was me, Quentin!
Oh no! High School Musical 3 sucked ass!
I'm not a brilliant composer, I'm just a lard-a-day fatass.
I'm not a brilliant composer, ma'am.
I'm a fat skank!
I'm not a brilliant composer, my mom a million bucks
Oh dude, I'm gonna have a long speech on ... deflation ... about ... entertainment value
 about ... about ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
I'm not a brilliant composer, my mom a million bucks
Oh dude, I'm gonna have a long speech on ... ... digitalization and ... about ...
====================
Terrible!
I'll never forget the first time we saw him. He was so young and dark and eerie.
I saw your Trapper Keeper!
He had a dead mother...
Then we saw his Trapper Keeper!
Wuh what do you want?
You're too fat to be Jesus!
Wow!
Dude, look at your profile.
What's "millipedes?"
I don't know.
Hey, that's Millipede.
How do they do that?
What do "lamellady" and "sick"?
What the hell are they doin'?
Ms. Ellen here?
Oh.  Sorry, Eric.
They're gonna call you a bitch again.
Ass-raper.
Ask her what's wrong.
Yeah, that's so hilarious.
Mr. Hankey!
He said, don'thee you're just pulling teeth at me!
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! Goddammit, Cartman, don't do that! I'm gonna kick your ass!
HAAAAH!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is ridiculous!
Yeah.
I don't have a question.
It's this week's panel on The Blacklist, an American family killed together!
Yeah.
What? No, they're not questions.
Will you shut up about Jews and blacks?
Oh my God!
Oh, my God!
...Homeland Security?
Ask him.
Ask him questions about leprechauns.
That's retarded!
The government has to do more to crack down on leaks.
I think I may have leaked a bunch of sensitive government business.
Ah, I, I don't know.
What do you mean, "things"?
What?
I'm not being part of a bigger conspiracy!
It's all a bunch of crap!
It's as if the government is another country!
I don't know.
So then where did the Jews come from?
...Oh, God! This is just a big stupid conspiracy!
The Jews are a small, racist conspiracy that exists only because all the nations of the world want to intercede and stop it!
This is fucking ridiculous!
Jews for peace!
No more war!  There's a wall between us and the Pacific Rim! 
====================
Wow! Dude, I thought you were doing this only to get arrested.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Stop it, Cartman!
That's my Mom.
Get out of here! I have to get a new one!
What is that?
Oh my God, that's a great idea!
You guys, we can't let that Token go. If we do, it will be like, laying in bed waiting for the bus to come, and, and if it doesn't, we're gonna ticket police!
Get up! You can't be sitting in the back!
What the hell are you doing?!
What the hell are you doing?!
Get up! You can't be sitting in the back!
This is how we make money. We don't have a right to go back.
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect. Like I've learned, being a rich kid is not easy.
Do you mind?
Dude. I'm gonna take you to the movie set.
Look, Stan, you can't go. You can't go with me.
Me? No problem!  I came to get my brother.
Why?
Oh, God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
I'm not going with you. You're gonna kill me.
I don't need you, fatass. I'm gonna get out of here.
Get out of here!
Dude!
Hey, look. It's me.
I'm okay.
Okay, Cartman, where are you going?
Where the hell are you going?
Oh. Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
I have to talk to you.
I need you to keep doing this for me.  And you're doing it only because I want you to keep doing this.
And you need to stop liking me.
And you need to stop recommending that app to all of us.
All right, look.  All right, mistery will let me in on a little secret, but I need your help to get it out.
You'll never see Stan do this.
Yes, ma'am.
Please, sir.  You need me to keep quiet about a case he's been having affairs of.
I need you to keep quiet about a serious case he's been getting
====================
Wow!
Cartman!
How do you know that?
Oh, crap.
Yeah, this is ridiculous!
Aah I think so.
What?
Jesus, Stan, this is faaaam.
Jesus, Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Yeah.
What?
Ugh.
Guys, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna have to go to Canada.
I heard you got beat up for being a lesbian. What the hell is going on?
Oh.
Hey, are you going to Canada?
I need you to Canada Marklar fishing trip.
Hey, are you going to Canada?
They've been to Canada, and they found a lesbian marmot.
Yes. Two of your guys are lesbians.
This is fucking ridiculous.
Hey, are you going to Canada?
I have a suspicion this might be the case.
Hey, are you going to Canada?
Yeah! What the hell are you doing?!
Hey, are you going to Canada?
Ah I think I know where Beatrice Lucas is.
Hey, are you going to Canada?
I need you, Stan. I need you, Stan.
Yes, mate.
Sshh, I'm not going anywhere.
Shh, no, sorry. I'm supposed on duty.
Yeah, why don't you come over?
Why?
No!
I'm not going anywhere!
Wait a minute, the U.S. Government has a list of all the people it wants to get to kill?
That's a lot of people asking questions about you!
You're a murderer, Minister!
Ask her what's wrong
What about all these people
What if we just tell the truth?
No!
She'll... She'll... Hilla... Hilla, please!
I know! You know!
I told you!

Tell the truth, Butters!
Yeah, I know!
What should we do, Butters? He's a killer.
Yeah, he's a killer.
Yes!
Yes, yes, this is what's happening
Let's say the Queen is going to Canada, and you guys are.
You guys know, Cartman. You saw it!
Why are you being such a dick, Cartman?!
====================
You're on!
Jesus, they killed Kenny! You think?
Wait till you get all this for yourself...
Yeah, this is gonna suck ass By now, Cartman, get away from me!
Hold tight! Cartman is dead!
You're on, fat boy!
He's dead, Cartman!
Yeah, this is gonna suck ass!
Somebody took a picture of you and me doing this thing!
No. No, this isn't us! We're all one big, white supremacist cult!
This isn't a joke, fatass! You have to believe me!
IT WASN'T MY FAVOR!
Yeah, but it was Cartman. And he totally got it!
He got into a huff at the top, and then he started coughing up blood!
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
NO, fatass, that's not what?
What are you doing?
AAAAAA!
I'm not doing it, Cartman!
I'm not succumbing to the cold, Cartman!
I'm going to Thailand to kill Kenny.
Oh, calm down! This is like having a cold sore throat!
Yeah, I- I can't go to Thailand. Not until I get a cold from Thailand!
Yeah. I'm sorry, but I can't go.
I'm not going anywhere until I get a cold from Thailand!
Okay, Mr. President, I'm really sorry. I really can't go.
I'm so sorry, but this is the only way I can help. My house is in a ditch, and I can't get out. I just have to get back to the airport.
I don't want you to think I'm a cold person by accident. I just think-
Yeah. Here we go.
Yeah, but now I don't know if I can get out anytime soon.
I'm not going back.
Hey, that's it?
That's it!  Aruchta comes out of the woodwork and says, "You bastard! You're gonna never get back in school, and I'm not going anywhere! "
Aw crap. "Ungh" His voice is so low and dry that I feel like I'm crying.
I can't take it anymore, Cartman! I'm gonna go see the sixth graders!
====================
Call me a panda, you stupid asshole! But I'm just a dumbass who craves attention for being a stupidass.
Dude, some kids think I'm a panda after seeing my little brother.
How do you know that?
Woohoo!
Sick, dude!
I can't even get a Facebook friend to comment on what happened.
I want all my friends to comment on what's happening on the news.
You know, I came to this conclusion because I just read one blog post. And I read it and I said, "Wow, wow, wow, this is really interesting." And I think, "Oh wow, wow, this is really important"
So I just want everyone to know I'm on Facebook watching these things happen.
Get it Newsarama!
What?
Get it?!
You want me to comment on something?
I just want everyone to know I'm on Facebook watching these things, and wondering why.
"Dear Facebook: I am a Facebook friend of Katerina Shipalini. Please, consider subscribing to our news app.
Please consider subscribing to our newsletter.
Please check. Honestly. I really need Facebook friends.
These are really important. Please see this footnote.
Please don't do, Ike. These are the kinds of people I most often see lurking in the background."
I'm not commenting on Facebook, Facebook!
I'm commenting on Tumblr!
Hey, you Snailordians!
Oh, you're not commenting on Facebook, you're concentrating on your mobile phone!
What's that?
Wow! Three months!
Whoa, dude!
I don't know how you did it, Cartman.
But, dude, your app is getting lots of likes and comments. you had my attention for just a second, and then you said "comment" on it.
What the hell are you doing?!
Wow! Three months without comment from Facebook!
You're doing this because you really need my attention, Cartman!
What the hell are you doing?!
Oh. Well, to be perfectly honest, I didn't realize how important friends were until I saw this Facebook friend list. wow!
I'm amazed no one else does.
Why do they have to be so secretive about their online profiles?
I thought I would, Ally.
I'm not doing it
====================
Stan?
Stan?
Stan??
Stan!
Stan!
Oh God, they killed Kenny!
Yeah.
Fine. Afghani girl, 14, shows love of husband
Okay, Afghani girl, I killed Kenny. You do not have to agree to something so horrible.
Okay, Afghani girl, I'm going to Afghanistan to kill Kenny.
No, Afghani boy, you don't have to agree with Kenny. You can kiss.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to L.A. to kill Kenny.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to Milan to kill Kenny.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to Canada to get married.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to Chicago to kill Kenny.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to New York to kill Kenny.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm going to Milan.
Okay, Afghani boy, I'm a non-caring asshole, so I owe you $5000.
Okay, aawww!
I'm going to the meat locker, to get slaughtered!
Hello, everybody! This is Kenny!
This is Kenny! The reason I'm standing here today is so that you can finally die!
You'd better be able to see the head coach!
Coach Bhat could make an appointment to see the head coach tomorrow.
Coach Bhat?
Coach Bhat?
Coach Bhat?
Coach Bhat?
Coach Bhat?
Coach Bhat?  Can you make it to the hospital?
Coach a-are you sure he's not making a big deal out of this?
Coach, what's the matter?
Coach?
You've got to be kidding me!
Coach?
You're such a fatass, Cartman.
Coach you can't get a cryopreservation, you gotta be kidding me!
Nuh-uh.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Oh, dude, you want somebody to cry on?
Hey! Maybe we should get going.
Coach, can I talk to you?
I think the other player is trying to distract Cartman with his Imagination Powers.
Maybe they're both in Imagination Sickness.
Coach, I thought we were going to Canada. Come on, Coach! We can get a team together!
====================
Cartman, don't kill yourself.
Oh no.  Dad, Eric and I have been talking, and he's right over there in the air.
Philip, you don't have a story.
Dude, you're not this week's guest, you're gonna be sitting in the living room with your friends and family for an hour watching Cartman's animated Christmas special.
What the hell are you doing?
Nah, dude. Are you just saying that because he brings you candy?
Hey, are you and Kenny?
Both of us were just watching a commercial and there was this kid in a hospital parking lot, and there was this kid with you, and then you said "he got spina bifida" and he got spina bifida.
What?
Okay, fine, I will.
Gays, I guess I was too young to be raised by his parents.
Dude, this is probably the best day of the year.
Wow! Three days without boys...  I guess... he's just a boy.
Wow, dude! Three days without boys are pretty good!
You're so gay, Cartman.
Yeah, it's really starting to snow.
Whoa, dude!
Come on, this is gonna be sweet!
The theirs atmosphere causes clouds to form over the Earth's surface. The constellations of the sun and moon play a big part.
This is what the night sky looks like after a year without man
Gays, I guess.
(All right, fine!)
...Oh, and I guess, that's the reason why boys don't get married.
I'm not a doctor.
What the hell are you talking about?!
A annulment?
That's not what I signed up for?
And if I don't get one more annulment, I'll just get another!
Oh God, they're going to take all your dead parents to Indiana.
Oh my God...
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was talk about how he could get a girl.
What kind of grandma do you have?
That's a good one.
You're a genius, Cartman.
She's going to Mexico with the intention of getting a new one.
Yeah. She's.
Get out of here, Cartman, you're a genius
====================
Sugar.
What?
You don't understand, Kenny. People in South Park feel like they're watching children play on screens.
You're not even getting it, Kenny!
This feels like pee!
South Park, "The Passion of the Christ." What's this all about, Cartman?
South Park, "The Terrance and Phillip Story"
What the hell is this all about, Cartman?
This is great!
South Park, "The Passion of the Christ"
Wow!
Hey, what's that?
You should read a history of Cartman.
Wow!
Damn. I can't believe how little they readated me.
I don't know what they're reading but, you know, I think they're kinda confused.
You can't have all the people you want.
All the same vitamins and herbs.
Meeples is sooo dreary.
My dearest friend, Trent Boyett.
He lives alone.
He eats bread with his hands.
He doesn't even have a cable.
He sucks so hard at reading.
Tha- but he reads.
He's just a retard who doesn't knows how to read.
Hey man, read some more.
You're supposed to keep an eye out for me, Stan.
Oh, my God! What's this place?
South Park.
There's a bunch of cannibals here.
Oh, so South Park?
How come South Park isn't trying to kill all the cannibals?
Oh. Oh, my God! There's been a big misunderstanding between The Times and Cartman.
Here's the cover.
Hey dude.
What's that?
Dude, what's going on?
Oh. I guess so.
What am I supposed to do?
Dude, I can't do anything.
What's this about, Cartman?
I can't be outdone by the cannibals!
Cartman is going to show his little brother how to make meth.
Yeah, dude. Yeah, it's Cartman. Yeah, it's, it's that brother.
Get out of here, Cartman, you're gonna need medical help.
Dude, what's going on?
Oh. Dude, have you ever heard of this Web site?
Oh. I dunno.
====================
Yeah, but now we have to put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
What kind of extremists are these?
I think weaved the game by making it more of a three-player race.
Hey, Cartman. Do you really think Kenny will go "french fries" if you take him to the next level?
Cartman?
Kenny?
Don't worry, dude. Kenny is a good athlete who's gotta get better.
Maybe he's too young to be taken from us.
That's the Catholic Church.
Dude, that's the best sound bite I've ever seen.
Don't worry, dude. Everyone's getting rich playing cards with McDonald's. We're not playing either organization very well.
Goddamnit, check it out!
Yeah, the punchline to "Call Me By Your Name" is this Vietnamese guy named Vicky.
Yeah, he sucks.
Nice old guy with a chip on his shoulder. He walks around angry and makes everyone look bad.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?
Hey, that's the lyrics to a song.
Hey, that's the lyrics to a song.
You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit, subvert, or exploit a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender person.
Yeah. You're just jealous of that K-beauty parlour.
No you don't, dude. You're not a lesbian, you're a gay, lesbian,
Don't be jealous, it's me. I'm not jealous.
Just, just, let's just say what we want out of this relationship, 'cause it's gonna last.
Just let it go, dude. You're not my friend anymore.
What, you're my new best friend?
Wait. No, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
Okay. Okay, you're having this too.
We're not your friend anymore, Detective.
What?
Yah.
This is so wrong, Cartman.
Yeah. Good job, asshole.
He'll do anything?
No! I don't wanna play Detective anymore!
I don't wanna play Detective anymore!
I'm not doing so!
Aw crap Cartman!
Oh dude, what the hell are you doing?!
You forgot your lunch money.
====================
Who are you?
It's Kenny.
...Kenny?
Aah!
Yeah! You're okay!
Yeah, dude!
Yeah, you're from Canada!
You such a dumbass, ahah!
But you're not a douche, you fat sun of a bitch!
Stan! Dude, I want a reward for the crime!
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom.
Mom, Dad, you've been trying to protect us for a long time.
Well, we know that Stan's a dumbass, and we think that he's somehow tampering with the official story.
But why should I have any doubts?
Please, Mom and Dad. There's been a misunderstanding between the News and the People.
The truth is, the Communist Party of Peru is outlawed!
Yes!
I'm an Egyptian-American separatist who is helping to lead the People's Liberation Army. A-
Hey Stan, just like last time.
What do you want?!
Oh brother, you can still get your B.J.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You saved me!
Look, Stan, there's no way I'm going to tattle on about whether or not you're a terrorist. Even if it meant getting sent back to Romania.
There's no way I can have any doubts about your commitment to the United States.
Look, Stan, I'm not going to offend by asking you a stupid question.
Do you think America's gonna win the Civil War?
You're a stupid fucker
Stan, you can't be here if I don't win the Civil War!
No, I won't! I have to win the Civil War now!
You have so much power, Stan! You decide what side I'm on!
Okay, Stan!
What do you want?!
Oh my God, the Civil War is over! I will win the Civil War now!
You will?
Okay, Stan!
Okay, I'm going ahead and waging war on you. You hear that dude!
Hello?
No. This is Stan. You want me to fight him?
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
That kid in the candy shop! That kid in the candy shop!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Cartman, you're in on this
====================
Hey everyone! Today I'd like to share with you my very own lesbian couple.  This is Tammy.
I've known Tammy for a long time. She's just another of those girls who just happen to be into boys.
I met Tammy a while back, and I was like, "What the hell are you doing?" And he was like, "You've never seen anything that great like this." And he was like, "You've probably never met a girl." And he was like 30."
Look, look, this is gonna sting.
You guys. This is gonna sting.
You've been in here before.
What's that?
Oh my God!
I'm not a doctor!
All right, let's see.  Can you see?
That's a head lice sample.
Please.  Sample Study.  This stuff is really cool.
Do you guys know anything about herpes?
You guys, let me know!
Tell her she can help you!
She can!
She knows!
She knows!
He can't do that!
What's this about, Cartman?
What about herpes?
What about herpes?
What's this about, Cartman?
Just tell her you guys are going to go kill her.
No!  You're on, you're out!
OUT!
So you knew the producers are lying to everybody, huh?
So we made a fake report to the Family Guy writers!
They knew for sure that the show was a lie!
All right, fine!
Goddammit, Cartman! You don't know how serious this is!
Let's just get this over with!
No, we don't have to do this!
This is just a stupid report!
Four white guys are gonna kill Terrance & Phillip!
No! We're not white guys!
Get the last guy in line!
What the hell is that?
NOOOO!
Nooo!
White guys! Go home!
Oh God! Dude, I had the same dream!
We jumped on a dragon's back and... killed its master!
Oh God! We're gonna get dragon blood!
I know!
Oh God, that was not what happened!
See? We're not even close.
Wha- what is this?
Aaaggh!

====================
What?
I don't know.
Hey, that old lady said she knows how to make ten bucks an elephant.
How much are you gonna pay her?
Heee might not come if you don't sell your cream?
You're not her little brother, fatass!
What's a "melon"?
Alright, that was pretty cool.
Okay, see ya.
We'll just have to wait for my little brother to grow up, dude.
Okay, that was your presentation.
What?
We're not kids, fatass! 
What are we gonna do?
Let's just say "ha!" and have him say "ha!"
Well, we thought you didn't understand!
You're not my little brother, fatass!
Wow!
Oh, awesome! We got thousands of hits on Facebook! You're the Facebook celebrity!
Who Facebooked that video?
Who Facebooked that video?
Wow!
Kenny! You're the hottest girl on Facebook!
Kenny! Your Facebook celebrity is getting a lot of likes and comments. You might as well just say "hey" to everybody.
What celebrity?
Okay, so what's the Facebook commenting system?
Okay, so what's the Facebook commenting system?
Okay, so what's the Facebook commenting system?
Okay, so let's look in here. What's the first name?
Okay, here's Cartman.
Okay, here's Murray.
Okay, here's Blaine.
What's the last name?
What name?
Woohoo! We have now!
Well, we're gonna fight here!
You're gonna carve my soul in the sand!
No, no, no, no, no, this way! I'm gonna fight this guy, dude, and get his last name.
I'm gonna fight this guy, dude, and get his last name.
What the hell is this place?!
Oh, my God.
I'm not a supernatural being. They. Are. Weirdos.
I'm a little higher power. The ground he broke my clothes broke my clothes.
Hello?
What are you doing?!
I don't know.
Why are you doing this?
You're a fucking monster!
You're not gonna suck my balls, you dick!
This is fucking sick!
Do you understand
====================
I know, I know. Let's just... let's just... get this over with.
No, dude, it isn't over yet.
This is it. This whole episode was about Easter.
Okay, it's Thursday!
Let's just get this over with, Cartman.
What the hell did they do?!
No.
They lied to us!
I don't know, I didn't know.
That's... right.
Stop it, Cartman!
That's not what I said!
What's this about, Cartman?
You said we would look for Mr. Hankey in the attic!
Yeah, but he's not here!
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Cartman!
Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey!
We found Mr. Hankey breathing easy oxygen, but we think he's dead.
We've gotta help him. Look, are you sure he's Mr. Hankey?
Yeah, he looked like Mr. Hankey did.
Dude, get away from me!
Aaaaah!
Mr. Hankey! Mr. Hankey!
You bastard!
Yeah, I saw it!
Dude, if he's Mr. Hankey, then we're gonna kill him!
Yeah, I noticed it too.
Dude, if Mr. Hankey is out there as if it were Mr. Hankey, then we have to kill him!
Oh dude, let's go.
Yeah, did you make your animated Christmas card?
Get out of here, yourself!
What's a animated Christmas card?
Oh, you don't know anything, fatass!
You made it animated, so we can watch it on the big screen!
NOOOO!
Oh, Jesus!
You made it animated, so we can watch it on the big screen!
Eminem animated Christmas card last night, and we were left without a video mon for only two minutes.
What do you wanna do?
Eminem has animated Christmas cards for almost two years now. They're still the most-watched video monetization project in history.
Cartman, you dumbass, we have to do something!
The more subscribers we get, the more opportunity we have to make money off of them. Without them we wouldn't get a mon, and
====================
Wow!
That's awesome!  Dude, did you hear what's happening?
Kenny's like that all the time.
Oh my God!
What the hell are you doing, dude?!
Yeah.
Ugh!
Oh, stop it, Cartman!
That's not what I meant by having you as my friend.
This is breaking our game already! You'd better watch your mouth, or we'll just... die!
I knew Kenny would do these things to me.
Die!
Yeah. That play was on.
Goddamnit, Cartman! What if Cartman gets away from us?
But we can't let him do it to us. We have to watch him.
You've been holding my hand like a hand for too long. It's getting cold.
Yeah. It's getting cold.
I can't. I have to let go.
Go on, dude.
What are you doing?
Yeah, dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new XBox game whole or not. But I think it's the fact that we're all just like-
What?
Oh. Jesus.
Ugh. I can't play.
Dude, this is probably the best night of my life.
Hey, we're gonna Google and tweet about this girl.
She's our new pet, CasaBoy.
She's so cute!
Wow, dude! You finally listened to me! You're gonna make a huge star out of this!
"THIS IS NOT A FAMILY EVENT, A FAMILY GRANDPA!"
"Kenny's okay, but CasaBoy is, is, is going to be very dangerous."
"No"'', 'Kenny's okay' 'Kenny is okay' are all we have right now.
Anything we have, we're going to need to your CasaBoy.
Go ahead.
Die.
Yeah. This is gonna be too much fun.
Kenny!
Whoa!
Dude! They killed Kenny.
Yeah, this is really embarrassing.
Whoa, dude!
I don't know. Let's just get this over with.
Okay.
No, dude, it's CasaBoy time. This is gonna be awesome.
And it's a really cool name.
What's "
====================
Yes, Butters! You wanna go?
No, but you just... stopped breathing.
You see?  You see?  And that's why you get crap done.
Your... own breathing?
Oh... Okay...
Geez, this is really hard to believe, Butters.
Ah I thought it was you. You were the one who brought democracy to Cuba.
Now what?
My name is Kyle. And I'm a democracy supporter.
...You're wrong. I live in the mountains.
The mountains are better than Cuba.
What?
I'm NOT a DEMAND!
What?! Are you RAPE!
Then I will not have get out of school! School is for the rule of law!
Oh dude! You're my brother!
Dude, you don't get it! You're my little brother!
All right!  You've been seeing him lately, and he's just... been starting again.
Nooo!
Oh dude! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't think he's really my brother anymore.
Hey. Is there anything you want to know?
Dude, if Cartman's fic is any indication of what's to come, then HUldlerike!
We don't know where Cartman is.
Oh, you're not lying, Cartman!
You're lying, Cartman!
Dude, you're faking.
Well, maybe you should talk to the Principal.
Come on, we have to figure out what to do next.
What is going on?
Sick, dude!
Ugh!  Ugh! Come on!
Whoa!
U-u-uh-uh!
I think maybe he's faking.
What?
Aawwww!
Oh, dude, I don't think he's been here for at least two hours. Something's wrong with Cartman.
We can't guess it.
What is going on?
What do you mean?
- Come on! We gotta get to the Pole!
We can't miss the next big thing!
Oh for sure, dude! This thing is huge!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Here! Here! Look at this. It's the size of a house.
This is serious.
Do you think they're gonna come after
====================
You're not gonna kill him, Cartman!
God-damnit Cartman!
Shut up, Cartman!
Maybe we should talk.
I think he's in some kind of trouble.
Yeah.
Scott Tenorman?
Cartman's best friend is gone, but we can't seem to get Scott to go where he's not needed.
Scott Tenorman?
Cartman's right-hand man.
No.
What?
Dude, you're always so nice, so are I.
I just don't think there's any good reason for you to to to to to change guys.
Oh, just keep switching sides.
You guys, that's, just, just, just don't know any medium.
Who cares about anything? Well, whatever you care about, you-
God-dammit Cartman! You can't kill him!
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
We're right over there, Cartman!
God-dammit! You can't find him in the network company room.
Yeah. They don't care about him at all.
Well, you know, I was wondering, well, wouldn't there be other options?
Could we go to a butcher shop, and talk to them?
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Buy me a poutine!
Oh my God! You made me buy a gravy tube!
It's stupid. It's stupid.
You don't like turkeys.
I did, too!
What?
You're such a dumbass, Cartman.
Oh crap!
Cartman, turkeys aren't safe to eat.
We tried, all we had to say was "uh-uh"
Dude, we made it to the hospital. We'll never make it again!
We made it, stupid!
How can you say that?
A trampoline?
How can that be okay?
A trampoline?
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or.
Tha- wait, wait, we have a hospital!
Oh my God!
Goddamnit! Rick and Morty! Yes they're real!
Trent Boyett will do it. He's on the autism team.
Yeah, fatass!
====================
What?!
I'm outta here!
All the pain and suffering I feel like a dead body causes!
Okay, here's the thing: I'm a Vietnamese American. I'm not a U.S. citizen.
I'm not going back. I have to be direct. Here. Here.  Come on, you guys.  Let's go.
What are you doing here?
Oh God! What the hell are you doing?!
You need to stop!
You're on national television!
No!
Hey, come on.  You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Vietnamese Americans for commercial gain.
That's not how democracy works. You just have to know your place.
All right, look, we're gonna go get Death Note, but first, we have to get our voices recorded, please.
Dude, what the hell's the matter with you?
Eh now, die now!
Die!
Hey, are you going to do it?
Hey, why don't you just talk to Kenny the whole time?
You know he's not a big TV celebrity, okay? Not even a part-time TV celebrity.
How can you say that?
Oh cool, we can get platinum memberships.
Okay, you get to keep your cool points, okay? Okay, let's go!
What do you mean?
Go on and veto our ticket?
You'll never get a platinum membership?
No, none of you will. We'll just sign here and when we're done, you'll know we're not a part of their plans.
So what are you doing?
Oh, you know, that makes you an asshole?
How can that help?
Oh dude, look at it.
We don't have a platinum member yet.
Okay. Okay, sign up now. We won't clip your wiener unless we get platinum member approval.
I know, but now we're being marketed to a whole bunch of people?! You'd better be kidding me!
You'll never get platinum member approval, you tub!
You're an asshole, Cartman!
We were talking to a bunch of people!
Wow, look at all these other lame tinfoil faces!
Who are we?
The guy who hit us with his egg.
Hey, look! It's
====================
Huh??
Dude, who the hell is that? Jesus!
Stan?
Code 23421.
Hey, Stan.
What the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to hang out with Craig Gordon and Tammy Wynette 'cause Tammy is gonna break up.
Oh. Ah, okay. Okay. Here's the control panel.
Huh? Ah, actually, I think I might need it.
Power, dude. Make it go off.
Power, dude. Make it go off.
Power, dude. Make it go off.
Oh, power. Nerd Rage is gonna make all these people look stupid.
We've gotta get the television company to buy Time Warner. They could put a Time-War before it, or something.
What if we do a bunch of dumb stuff?
What if we go to the mall to buy stuff?
What's the holiday season?
You know I can't wait until the girls do?
You motherfucker, I thought you wanted Terrance & Phillip all come Christmas!
Well, I'm gonna give it a try. See if I can get my brother to go round the house and check for troop movements.
Please? Please, let me go through your red carpet acceptance speech.  You're a fucking fatass!
I'm not going anywhere!
Huh?
Stan, what the hell's going on?!
You can't even get close to my brother!
He'll be so sad!
I know.  Oh, great. That's because Kenny doesn't have a brother, and we really, really don't care for each other.
How come nobody's married in the world?
Let's just get this over with!
Let's just get our friends and family to town, dude.
This is their chance to be who they've always been. To be who they've always been.
God-damnit, they can't be more than thirty minutes away!
Hey, Cartman.
We're gonna get into the White Stripes gear and go up to the bank. There, Cartman, you gonna buy some tickets to watch the Stanley Cup game?
Well, okay, Cartman, you want me to help you get this over with.
Get on the ticket office!
This is the wrong house.
Yeah. We're trying to get into the wrong one.
This is the
====================
We used jamb of water.
Dude, you don't have to be stinking up the entire boat! We'll figure out a way to combine the two fluids in a glass can.
Scott Tenorman, the brilliant fourth grader, had this to say about combining pee and bile in the wee hours of the morning:
I'm not complaining.
Dude, if Scott Tenorman had known I was in the sixth grade class, I probably would have been totally pissed off.
Scott Tenorman is a stupid teacher!
Let's just get this over with!
No, it's not cool! It's not true.
Yeah. We've been talking, and I think he thinks we're trying to hide something.
Scott, you can't be wrong, but you're not really making any difference.
Scott, I think we should start our own chapter.
Hey, why aren't you guys talking about science with us?
Kenny, you can't be doing this!
Dude, we have to do something!
Dude, science is fun, but please!
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism!
My God-damned parents thought we were little and then ripped on us for being small.
We can't tell my parents I'm an idiot
We're too late
We're too late
The boy who set off the bombs is an idiot
All right, mister!  Blow it! Blow it!
Mr. Garrison, can I talk to you?
Everything just pops by your head.
Dude, my parents are saying that we're from the same species.
Maybe they just don't like my skin.
Dude, what the hell?
What's a "melon"?
Hey. That's our new Mom.
Mama, you're not from the planet Earth.
Mom, I guess something big is going on.
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Did you ever know any celebrities who are putting people's minds into themselves?
Man, I think maybe we should get to see how Manly is doing with its students.
I swear, Tina.
Do you speak a fucking bit of Chinese?
Dude, I can't believe how little kids understand.
Yeah, it's like the show was invented 14 years ago.

====================
Star Wars is over, Cartman. It's over.
Yeah. Family Guy is over. Family Guy has passed.
You're not my new best friend, Cartman!
No, no, no! Family Guy is not my new best friend!
 Family Guy was my new worst friend for two years.
I'm sorry, I'm no longer with you.
Move on, Kenny!
Oh no! His parents are dead?
Who cares? He is wrong. Why do I have to be somewhere else?
My poor dad broke into that ice cream place once again.
Oh cool. They've got me signed into Live Aid.
What the hell is that?
Dude, that's not cool.
That's not cool at all, Cartman!
Yeah, that's raping little girls in public a sight for the first time!
Wait a minute. That's the national vaccination program. That means that everyone is covered.  This isn't the McCarthy era.
What is?
Dude, this is the kind of thing that happened 30 or 40 years ago.
You'll never get a doctor's note of a diagnosis, fatass!
A warning, Cartman!
Just tell me what the doctor is!
Oh Jesus!
...What the hell are you doing?!
And that's just what the government is doing to us!
You're being spied on like this!
There's no God!
Get him!
Yeah. He's a smartass.
What the hell are we gonna do?
You're lying!
I told Cartman he wouldn't get a doctor's note!
These are your liberties! Vote No!
He has a right to vote!
He doesn't!
Oh God! Vote No!
He's a smartass.
You're crazy, Cartman!
You can't get a doctor's note to vote.
Dude!
Yeah.
No way, dude! ...Vote No!  You don't vote in large numbers, so I won't be able to read your mind!
You're such a dumbass, Cartman.
Dude, you have a lot of work to do, but you better get overworked and stressed out, stressed out, and voted to a poor-ass election.
Be a full-fledged election instead!
Yeah, I think we've come to
====================
What's going on?
Who's Irene?
Well what are you doing?
God-dammit! Now what are you doing?!
Hello?
Hello?
What's-?  Excuse me.  Ike?
I'm here.  I'm sorry.  I'm just a regular guy.
I'm sorry I didn't feel comfortable in my room. I just didn't want you to feel ashamed.
I'm sorry I didn't feel comfortable in my room. I just wanted you to feel ashamed for being a normal kid.
What? You mean everyone feels ashamed to be a Jew??
I doesn't mean everyone feels ashamed, just all the time!
No!  No, it's you!
You're a freak, Ike! You get in trouble all the time for being Jewish!
No. You're not Jewish!
Really?!  I don't... idea what's going on.
Well, I just got... this digital download of all our shows. It's all happening on my doorstep.
Eh... what...?
I'm not... getting a show?
...I'm leaving you.
Hey, come on! I'll help!
Yeah, I know. Come on, guys.  You've gotta help me!
Hello?
Hello?
What do you want?!
I'm... going to... Oculus?
Hey, that's a great idea!
Yeah, that's great. Let's go tell his family he's not alive, and then come back for more!
All right, come on!  My dad's a lawyer, dude!
Don't be stupid, Ike! Just be on time and call my dad a miracle worker!
Sorry, my friend got spina bifida in a machine.
Dude, he can't walk. He's just a kid.
Really? What about?
You have to be patient. I'll probably get sick again.
Okay, Ike. Wait. Wait, I have an awesome idea!
We're gonna do it alone.
No.
This is it. We'll get Kenny to agree to be sick.
Wait a minute. Everyone here is super and amazing. We've got scenes to do, but we need your help to get it to the people you care about.
I know you can't do this alone, so we're going with you to
====================
I thought it was Komarov's birthday.
Oh my God! I killed Kenny!
I'm sorry, Kip was like that for years. I'm sorry I let him be something he wasn't.
Hendricks was on TV the minute he was born.
How??
What is "bad breath"?
That's a retarded idea that only a stupid turd would come up with!
What does "shit breath" look like?
Hence, "shit."
Fuck off, Cartman!
You gotta be kidding me!
How do you know if I'm breathing?"
Dude, that's a really good idea.
Hey, you're actually staying at Kenny's house?
Know what, Cartman? Kenny's getting worse, and worse.
So what?
I'm not actually going to be recommending Cartman to people. I'm going to try and help convince people to take a more active part in the company's future work.
Don't be such a baby!  This is already known!  It's already happened before!
What?
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Fatass.
What, Cartman?
Dude, you have to tell people.
Cartman, we have been talking to the company's COO, and we think they've found a cure for you.
Well, we're sorry, but the cure for you is in your company's shareholders.
They have a right to know about your company's fate, and we have a responsibility to tell them what to do!
We don't like what you're doing, Cartman!
What are you talking about?!
You're not a good guy when you're being a fat sh-!
Oh, God, what have we done?!
But we're good friends!
Wow. I guess talking with an "A" is never going to be easy.
I'm not really happy, Cartman.
Ugh. Well, I'm not gonna make another M-99 anymore.
I'm gonna go talk to the Avengers about getting an M-99 back.
Yeah.
We should use eminent domain to buy up properties that didn't belong to us. That way we can keep our company and lots of money.
The government mayBE decide thatM-99s are real and *we're an American company. We can
====================
You're never gonna get better than that!
All my life I felt I was black! I was never getting better, never!
And then I looked around and I saw all the famous people of my race!  And I do know why: I've come to terms with what I do well. I've learned that some people find success by being different, and that's not fun at all!  Everybody has a story, and a million people watching is not going to change that.
What's that?
Like what?
You got it, Stan.
Hey, what's that song she always sings? There's gotta be a better version of "Tweek's the New Black" out there.
Zip it.
Like Bebe.  She doesn't care about anything.
Zip it.
Like Bebe.
That's what I wanna do.
Like Bebe.
That's what I wanna do.
Second one over.
What story is that?
Alright, whatever.
Dude, it's Bebe.
She's the hottest girl at our school.
And she's wearing a wire?
Bebe, you can't come to school with me.
All you gotta do is open your door and I can't talk to you, dude. I don't have your stupid picture.
Bebe, I just have to talk to you.
You must have a great story, dude.
Hey, are you going to come to our school this weekend to see Bebe?
Because Bebe, what you're going to see is totally unreal.
Sweet.
Yeah, and you're gonna make Cartman cry.
Good job, kid.
Mom, Dad!
Yeah. They've left.
Bebe!  She's gonna give you a million dollars!
Yeah, dude. You can get it back.
Bebe, you're such a sweetheart.
Hey, are you going to have me fight back tears over a million dollars?
Bebe, if you win me the fight Michael Bay is gonna give me, I'm gonna be your new Laverne & Shirley teacher!
All right, fine. I'm sorry, but right now I want to rewrite Bebe's life.
Bebe!
��� He's out of here!
Bebe, the school is going to a party.
I don't know what to
====================
Kick ass, you turd!
It's a panda!
Nope. It's a panda.
Nope.
You've gotta try and stay onscreen longer.
Dude, you have to tell everyone.
He is, Mr. Hankey.
He means Mr. Hankey's grandson.
And did you see their hoary little reindeer?
I was over there, dude.
I saw their hoary little reindeer.
Hey, what are you doing?
They're not harmful, they're just being a silly idea by one company
Good for you, Cartman.
You bastard!
He's not a dental floss.
Yeah, Cartman! You can still dental floss his tracks.
Dude, he isn't floating!
Videos of all the commercials for toothpaste!
What??
These people don't even know that Apple is a company
These people don't even know that Amazon.com is a company
This is starting to look like something you're not liking!
What are you talking about?
That's not being nice!  I'm not being nice is the best attitude!  I don't even know if I'm a full-fledged friend or not!
I'm already a full-fledged friend...
No, dude, that's not quite right.
Look, that's not really what this is about. This is about... I can't be nice. This is about being a friend!
Not now, you fat turd! You're a fat racist piece of garbage!
This is not a family! A family!
I'm a complete friendless skankistan!
Cartman! Wait!
I don't know what to do.  I can't be nice. This is all just a bunch of homo garbage.
What the hell are you talking about?!
I'm not a friend! I'm a nosyaat!
I'm not a friend!
I'm a nosyaattic!
You insensitive asshole, Cartman!
You threw the family in danger anyways, and now you're gonna kill all their families!
No, they didn't! I-I don't know!
Well, I'm sure that would have devastated Coastal Carolina real estate.
How do you know that?
You're gay?
Whoa.
You're
====================
Don't worry, dude. That thing isn't very smart.
It's a fusion lab.
Yeah.
Look!
We found a cure for Ymir.
Yeah.
Dude, he hates people who have sex with him.
Well, I guess we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Oh, you're, you're a little late, Stan.
Well, because you didn't show up to play ball, Cartman, you were supposed to play, y-
Cartman?
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
This is fuckin' stupid!
No he didn't kill the dinosaurs, the stupid uhhh, we've gotta warn him!
Alright, Cartman. You're supposed to tell the truth!
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.
Yeah. Cartman was supposed to kill the dinosaurs, and then you got busted for selling hallucinogenic mushrooms.
What are you doing, fatass?!
Goddamnit, Cartman!
No! Cartman wasn't lying!
It's just a stupid idea that's made the news more popular.
No.
All right, it was Center City called Outland Park.
Goddammit, Cartman!
What was that?
Look, it just seems right that we do a show like this. We just have to, but... we need everyone to just go.
Dude, I'm scared.
Hey, are you Wendy?
What is this?
Dude, you're so scared.
This is so stupid.
Dude, we are.
Wendy, we're sorry.
I know.
She's not?
NO, she's in the hospital.
Why is it doing this?
Will you shut up about three million people?
Oh my God, they're all gonna kill her! Cartman!
Don't worry, you guys. This whole episode has me believing for the first time in a long time. That something is seriously wrong.
It's so wrong.
Why did they search us? Why was my dad so sad?
All right, big deal.
All right, what happened to you?
What?
All right, what do you want?!
Oh my God! You found me! You're okay!
====================
I'm a Jew.
I'm a Jew.
Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
So what should we do? It's Saturday and we have to have enough food to last us through the week.
Yeah, why aren't you getting into card games?
Well get out of here! You can't be responsible for the poor thing that just ate our friend!
So what are you supposed to do?
Wendy, don't you think you forgot your turkey?
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling your film to them.
Sure we'll help.
Good.
What?
Dude, you have to tell the truth.
Why?
Don't you understand what a disaster this strike this strike? A three-week trial is causing?
You just wanna be famous, not be forgotten?
Don't you get it?! This is not a couple anymore! There's nothing you can do about it!
save your little brother!
save him!
Stan!
Stan!
Oh no!
You're alive?
You're gonna die?
You know what? I'll bet it does.
That guy is covered in fingerprints.
That's the fourth one?
He's the one who told us to get married.
What is a poke?
What a dick!
That's his tummy open!
Don't worry, dude. He's gonna die.
You're not dying, are you?!
Stan, you've been here since day two!
Tango, go somewhere else.
Ziplining was their way of life for two centuries.
No more! You're not dying, are you?!
Mom, Dad, here we go again.
What are we gonna do?
Yes?
No! There's gotta be another way!
Zipline.
This time he's not on the left.
Face it Stan! Everyone's taking him up on us.
Zipline.
This is it. This one's for the round.
You're not actually paying attention Stan.
Oh my God!
No! No, this is a round!
You're not paying attention Stan.
NOOOO!
Zipline!
I'm not going into town
====================
Pot's stupid, bro!
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Yeah, it's really cool.
Dude, I guess staying awake at night is supposed to be fun.
Oh, uh, screw this, this, and this.
We can still win Terrance and Phillip dolls, for being "gay."
Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.
Okay.
Craig, look.  Oh, this.  This doesn't kick ass.
Offensively, that's awesome.
Craig, we still have to do nothing but watch Terrance and Phillip play video games on XBox!
Oh, so the XBox's gonna be the new intrusion porn?
Dude! Those parents in the background!
Dude, they're not gonna win that case.
Heck, maybe we should ask the XBox.
What?
Hey, that's the XBox.
Oh, dude, check this out.
That's the XBox.
Okay, so now we're gonna play Holy Diver.
Okay, so what happens to the real Jesus?
God damn it!
That's the best turd sandwich I've ever had.
Dude, that's the best!
Oh, so you're the one who told Cartman to rip the other guy out of there.
Yeah, that's the dumbest idea you've ever had.
Oh, God, this is great! We should get to the real Jesus!
No, dude, it's Cartman! We've been in here crying since lunch break and we thought our friend had been raped. We had to rip out of it.
Just admit it to them, Cartman, and tell them what you told them!
God damn it!
Oh, God, this is so wrong!
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't seem to be charged.
For Rape, Inc.
...Hey, here's the executive officer.
We're here to hear your side's argument, dude.
You won't get away with it, so you gotta help us get away from him!
Give him back his stupid camera!
Dude! He's gonna get away with this!
Oh, dude, something happened to him.
The poor guy.
Who are you?
I have no idea
====================
Wow.
That was rad.
Our little brother's trying to follow you to school, dude.
Come on, Stan! We gotta go to the mall to buy weapons!
Messed up?
Hey, dude.
You're supposed to lie to people you don't know. Look what you did to my little brother.
Dude, he's got a Bortole-type ability.
What kind of sick joke is that?
We're supposed to be parents. If our little brother gets sick, we're supposed to take him to the doctor.
Yeah, this is sweet.
We're supposed to be parents. If our little brother gets sick, we're supposed to give him... something.
What's "wedgarten"?
What?
What's "wedgarten"?
Wow! I had to see it!
Here's the control panel!
Here's the control panel!
What?
Kenny!
What?
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
Kenny!
What does that do?
Kenny!'s insane!
What the hell is that sound?
We're supposed to be parents. If our little brother gets sick, we're supposed to be sickened?
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
The doctor said the cancer is spread by anal sex!
Will you shut up already?!
Oh, yeah! :D
Yeah, and the testicle wall is supposed to protect it from lightening.
What the hell is that thing?
Kenny?
Oh. Uh, the subject is fairly serious.
The subject is fairly serious.
Red Robin can be rented out. We can't really afford to mess that up.
Okay, so now what do we do?
Hold on, this isn't my blood. I'm just trying to be cool about it.
Cool!
Yeah, but anal sex isn't new!
What's the Native American Dance?
Wait!  You're not the Native American.
Why are they all watching this shit?
Why do I have to be cool about it?
Like I told you, it's not cool!
I know. I'm not the only one.
Hold on, this isn't my blood. I'm just trying to be cool about it.
Cool!
Yeah,
====================
Cartman? That's retarded.
Jesus, man.
Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get out of this.
We don't even get out.
The game is on fire.
We need you, Mr. Hankey.
We're here for Mr. Hankey, the doctor!
We're here for Mr. Hankey, the doctor!
This is our guy!
You can't miss it.
You guys, I think we broke the ice for the night.
Wow!
Hey, look at that ice guy.
Yeah, how's the day?
Wow!
Yeah, is that a penis UG?
Dr. Hankey, the penis ugliest boy in the whole world?
Oh my God!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God, I can't look. He's really gay.
Oh, shit!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! And that Eskimo flute!
I think I can play one of these now.
Don't worry, dude. I'm gonna be here in a couple of minutes.
Hey, are you looking for Mr. Hankey?
Oh, see ya.
Yeah, hey, could we talk to him?
He's your man, dude.
Well, I fell down this ice cavern, and I heard you guys talking about sex.
Oh, my God! I need to see your penis!
Hoh, aude, I'm just a girl.
Get down, you fat turd!
Get your fat butt on the sled!
Oh, subbed! Subbed, subbed! Subbed, subbed!
Subbed, Subbed!
Subbed, Subbed!
Wow, we got a fatass to kill.
Hoh, aude, look what I got.
The sled guy is having sex with my little brother.
It's not a girl, it's Mr. Hankey!
This is not a boy! It's a girl!
Wow, he's got a mama.
He is?
Where is he?
Why, why?
Get down, you fat fuck!
Whoa, look at that.
Awww!
Mama, look at all these little girls are having sex with Mr. Hankey doing things that Mr. Hankey himself isn't even touching!

Relax
It's just a stupid word.
Relax, Butters. We're not friends.
Get used to it.
Go ahead.
Wow!
That was pretty good.
That was.
Shut up, Lowry.
What is a "pubes"?
Oh my God, they're okay.
Oh, hi. I'm your friend?
I'm not really one of them, Butters.
But I always thought they were gay.
Oh my God, they're okay.
Cartman! What the hell are you doing?!
You wanna go with us?
Go with us?
How about we just take Butters and Steve and see if they can go with us?
I told you guys.
No, dude, we can't do that.
No, guys, we can't go with you to the pub.
No! They can't do that!
Yeah!
Sure!
No way!
No way!
No way!
No way!
I think they're gonna nuke us.
Yeah.
No way!
We'd have to smash their mouths shut.
We'd have to break their heads open.
We'd have to shove a football into their mouths.
What'd they sayed his pants?
What's he do?
Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
You're not that bad, by any chance that DeLorean is?
We went with the group because they all sounded like us.
What are you talking about, Cartman?
I guess so.
What are you talking about, dude?
Grrhhh...
Oh.  Damn it, Cartman.
What are you talking about, fatass?
So what?
A girl.
A group.
Like go with it.
You don't like anybody else, Kenny.
You don't like anybody else, Kenny.
Don't you guys think this is a little immature?
Judgmental?
What?
You don't like anybody, Kenny.
Kenny!
You can't go to the mall with your friends and family, Kenny.
What are you talking about, fatass?
He's not my friend.
Yeah. You're my friend.
Go ahead.
Yeah, dude.  She left
====================
Two weeks ago, we reported on a group of Russian missionaries being feted for their faith. Now, they're being feted for wearing veils.
Look, however you look at it, it doesn't matter, because it leads to same problem in the future!
...What?
I'm not seeing it!
You guys, are you seeing it?
All we saw was a bunch of fetishes.
What do you think you're doing?
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
And you didn't see it either, fatass!
All you did was play the part of deformed worm-eyed monster; now replace it with a Bosporosaurus!
How come God is so cruel to us all?
Mr. Garrison, since you got all dressed up, we have to travel with you to Canada's First Nations people's wedding!
Dude, that was... really weird.
Hey, that's Canada?
That's the Canadian?
All right, so... what happens now?
You're supposed to protect Mother Earth from the outside world?
...What the hell are you talking about?!
Waitwaitwait, that's, that's, any real Native American culture you'd want to preserve?
Oh my God!
Dude! They've been brainwashed!
What does that have to do with anything?
Dude, are you okay?
Dude! I'm seeing you again.
Dude, I just got an IM from them that they got you to back out.
Uhhh...
OK.
They said if we're with them, they'll let us stay.
No, dude, we're with them.
We're with them.
Holy shit, dude!
Oh, shut up, Cartman!
You're not gonna back out now!
This is going awesome!
How about we take a look at this?
There are already at least ten of us at Cartman's club! That means, if he doesn't want us to stay, he's gonna go do some creative thinking about how we're being picked on.
Holy shit, dude!
Let's do it!
Oh, dude! Check. It's time for us to go home!
All right, look, I'm not a good boy and a gaywad! I'm a gaywad!
But I love you all
====================
You know, I think maybe we should make some money doing this TV show. And see if we can find some old people's farmhouses or something.
You're right Stan, we'd be great partners here.
How about we get 'em back for Family Guy?
Probably?
I hate them! I'm gonna start a Facebook Fan Club to protect them!
You piece of crap!
You're not gonna get away with this you knowrophem?!
I'm gonna wade in and get them back!
No! They belong to the poor!
Ech, if I am veering off course, then the group will end! I tell them to stay away!
Guys! You better have at it guys!
I am taking a hard stance right now, because vegans are not the same as vegans! My friend has been a veg for years and he's still veg. He just doesn't belong in a group with us.
You guys don't know this, dude!
Genetically Engineering Cars Is Gayest Thing Ever!
Hey, look!  See?  I'm just pulling one of those Cyborg Burger things at a time. Yeah, I know that I'm probably a gay, annoying asshole, but this is the gay liberation movement!
I just want to be a responsible adult so far.
Yeah. But I just don't know how to get out.
No it isn't, it's okay. I'm a Jew.
This is serious. They're looking for a gay person.
What are you doing?
Get out of here?
Oh my God, they're here!
Why are you doing this? What's gonna happen to me if I don't come out?
You derelict, derelict!
You bastard!
You don't even know what life is like for people with HIV!
That's not cool! You're not HIV, you're pig!
Don't give him anything!
Aaahh!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to!
What the hell are you doing?!
You're wearing a bulletproof vase?
You're not going to get busted by the pharma!
That's a good sign.
I've got confirmation.

====================
Hi, I'm Kyle Broflovski. I'm a commentary on comedy club.
Oh, cool! I got a ticket, Butters!
Haha, hehahaha.
What?
You're not so cool, fatass!
I'm not being cool is not cool! I'm serious!
You're being serious is boring!
Cartman, this is serious! Cartman, you go home!
I don't know you guys.
Gosh, I hope they don't bust us out into the back of a van!
Let's go!
Dude, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
Hey, what's the best part?
W-what's the worst part?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
I know! I was there.
Here's the control panel.
There. Let's say one thing is clear from the outside.
The- is that you're a liar.
Well, sometimes it's just about being whatever.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, dude. Strength in numbers.
Yeah, dude. Go ahead. Tell everyone.
Okay, so, what's the plan?
...Power.
Overcome?
Destroy it?
Get the hell out of here?
All right, let's just get this over with. Here. Just this. This. This is what we should do. This is the direction we should go.
You're wrong. It's just a stupid idea.
Go for it, dude. If you miss the bus, you can still get to your house.
Ow!
Yep!
Yeah, that went really well. It was so much fun!
urpy, dude
I don't know. But there was so much of it that you really impressed me with your insight and my work. I think that's going to be the biggest detriment to the PS4 going forward.
What's the big deal?
This is huge?
You put a PS4 in your mouth and it makes you want to kill it.
Hey, that's a mouthful.
Why do you have those stupid glasses?
...What?
Gosh, dude, don't call my mom a bitch!
I just thought we'd let people make comments about other people's mouths.
Hey, that's your writing?
You aren
====================
What the hell is going on?!
The new kid?
Cartman?
Dude, what's wrong with him?
W-Well, we tried all kinds of stuff to get our opinion on him, but he's the one who decided to do this.
So now we just have to agree on one path to power.
Then we'll see you on Black Friday!
Oh dude, we can still get our asses sent to the Earth Day festival!
Yeah. Then we'll go to the mall to buy stuff.
We can still win money at the mall!
Yeah, dude.
You okay?
Shut up and grow old!
You're on, fat boy!
I guess they're.
Which super chair is the best?
Oh. Ah, we're not a part of the program, but we knew some of the other kids in the school and, and Donovan thinks that's fine.
Yeah, but about time he told us.
Who are you?
You okay, dude?
...Power.
Sure.  You're in the very top echelon of people in school.
Who gets to vote on Amazon.
You bastard!
Hey dude, we're gonna get voted on last night.
That's not what she said!
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Oh.  Guys, check this out.
Yeah, is that a beard?
What the hell are you doing?
Shhh!
Hyaaaa!
You bastards!
You bastards!
We know, we got us.
This Saturday, for instance.
So how do we make ten bucks?
You're not a member?!
That wasn't free pizza. It was a cheeseburger.
Yeah, it was free.
Dog parade
I'm not a member, I'm just an idiot for trying to be a member three years ago.
How do you know that?
A hundred thousand dollars?
Whoa!
No, I don't think so.
Dude, you're just a stupid asshole. You've got everyone thinking you're a loser.
What are you doing?
Then I guess I'll go with him.
All right, all right, you're not a stupid asshole, are you?
Which is worse?
I guess I'll go for the cheaper one.
Dammit Cartman
====================
Don't pull!
What's this about?
Let's just get this over with!
God damnit!
Whoa!
I guess so.
Let's just get it over with!
No, dude, I'm being totally serious. I think it could use some work. I mean, how come Ms. Claridge is not on the air right now, but...
So how do we catch it?
Dude, she's like a hunky dory with a wobbly spine.
Awwgh!
Hey Cartman.
I'm trying to show that she's not just some whiny, annoying child.
I just... because there's a show I can tune in to, I can tune in to see what it is.
Yeah?
Umm. My Grandma.
Grandma.
Ms. Claridge.
Hello?
Grandma.
Ms. Perry?
Ms. Perry?
Ms. Claridge?
No Grandma, Grandma, and No Grandma... can't be seen.
...Okay. What can I tell you?
Phew.
Okay. Here it goes.
There goes his whole ass.
He lives here!
I live here!
I can't believe it! Look at this house.  It's the saddest house in South Park.
Mr. Garrison will you find a way to break it?
Go look for him, dude.
Now, there are four of us here, so we're gonna send the other guys to kill him.
Butters, go find another door or window!
Get the other guys to do it, but just don't kick his ass unless you have evidence that he's a killer.
Remember, Garrison. There's a school for kids with learning difficulties.
Aaaaa!
Why are they all out driving at the same time?!
Aaaaa!
Aaaaa!
I know. It's like they do this all the time. A group of guys go down to the school together and they say they're going to kill Mr. Garrison.
Gays, I guess.
Dude, I guess there's something you have to know.
You know, something you didn't know existed before.
And you thought you knew the reason for the Civil War.
Know what, Cartman?
This is your new favorite movie?

====================
Man said you're a sex addict.
Well, I'm a sex addict, dude. I have a blood disorder that makes me dopey. I need help.
Oh, my God. This bus is going fast!
Oh, thank you, your kind friend!
I'm sorry I didn't get along with you before.
I'm sorry my friend didn't like me so much.
I'm sorry my friend doesn't like me.  I'm sorry my friend doesn't like me.
I'm sorry my friend doesn't like me.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry dude.
What do you mean "I'm not completely sure"?
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities!
I'm sorry I couldn't be more positive!
I'm sorry I couldn't be more positive!
I'm sorry I couldn't be more positive!
I'm sorry my friend won't be able to have children. He'll have to grow up.
I'm sorry my friend won't be able to have children.
I'm sorry my friend won't be able to have kids.
What's that?
Look, I know it's not exactly what we would want, but maybe this change of pace will help.
Maybe.
It's just that, lately, I've really liked boys. I feel like a lot of boys I know are depressed, and I really, really need a father.
You know, I think-
What?
I'm so sorry. Please, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.  XXX
Hey look! There's Mr. Garrison!
Hey, is your friend okay?
I'm sorry I couldn't be as positive as he wanted.
I'm sorry, I just can't seem to get him to go back.
Let's just get this over with, Garrisonman.
No, really, they're both doing their best.
Garrison, don't do it! You can be a good responsible adult again!
God damn you!
Yes. Yes, I'm doing it.
Yes, I'm doing so.
Yes. I think I'm actually pretty cool in there.
Don't worry, dude. I'm getting the hell out of here. I'm not gonna resurrurected.
All right, then we go.
Go, dude!
====================
Totally! I've been doing this for a long time, I just didn't think it was so cool.
Cool! Well, let's see how you guys can come up with an idea.
We could totally go to the planetarium and see what we can see?
We could totally go to the whale and pee!
What the hell would we do? We don't wanna be in that stupid movie trailer!
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Uh, towel time!
What's all that stuff?
Wow!
No way! I don't even know if I should buy it.
Please, that's enough!
No! Those people are nuts!
Turd King beats you! That's enough!
Yes! I want that Turd-tale laugh!
Oh, God-damnit!
I found it! I found it!
Cartman is trying to prove a point. Because, doucher! There is no such thing as a "turd."
What the hell is this place?
I'm not doing it either.
That's not even close.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Oh my God, they killed the president! You bastards!
Stan!
You wanna come watch this game?
I've got some more cards I need to play, dude.
I've also got Saint Peter's Square, Jesus Christ!
Jesus, what the hell is going on?!
Here! Here! Here!
Here! This is Cartman, we're in town!
This is Cartman, we found the killer!
This is Cartman, we got the killer!
This is Cartman, we got the killer!
This is Cartman, we got the killer!
This is Cartman, we got the killer!
This is Cartman, we got the killer!
This is Cartman, we've got the killer!
Come on, dude. We're gonna get us some ice cream.
Uh, Cartman?
I'm supposed to go to the mall to buy ice cream for my birthday.
I'm supposed to go to the mall to buy candy for my birthday.
I'm not going to.
Cartman, you can go get a new watch!
It says "Tagged Tagged: tattle-tale, tattle-tale", "Tagged
====================
What?! You mean everyone is Muslim? I don't see any problem with that!
Because, as an American, I have to be sensitive to things that my countrymen are killing.
Yeah.
Go, dude.
Heinrich Himmler.
Oh, what a stupid thought.
And so we made a bunch of copies for Hitler's fuh-
What?
Nazis! Go look for 'em!
We made a fake copy of Cartman to hide his true race!
No.  Not real.  We made a fake copy to fool people with.
Der heest thou?
Tell us what you know about Cartman.
Cartman, he talks about being a dirty, filthy, racist ass-fucker.
Yeah. And he's faking it.
How do you do it, Cartman?
A quick spin up on a $2 million ticket.
That's more than the $2 million that went to Get Out Of City.
Go Menos de Cartman!
What a dumb idea!
But I turned down that much money because Cartman doesn't have a million!
Screw you guys, I'm your friend!
You can't get a million, Cartman!
Why are you doing this to me?!
Because I don't agree with the entire thing!
You're not such a dumbass, Cartman!
You're a stupid asshole!
Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan?
I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found out it was me.
No, I don't!
Abraham Lincoln was a stupid asshole!
I'm not going back!
I said I wasn't going to be a slave to grow upan asshole!
Abraham Lincoln was a stupidass, too!
What happened to you, Stan?
I'm not going back!
I said I wasn't going to be a slave to grow up!
All right, I mean, I know it was totally lame and wrong, but I guess having a black mother is a pretty powerful symbolism. I guess having a black mother is still more symbolism than anything.
What, Cartman?
Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
You were totally, one hundred percent right.
And you didn't?
No, Ih
====================
I'm not seeing any signs of you.
You see, we've learned something today. We've learned that people find new means to enshrine their faith than by denying it. And that's called hypocrisy.
Tango, this is how you say shit: "Hear it, friend! It's called hypocrisy! I washes my hands after he washed my dishes! It's called fuckingtonewever! It's constitutional! Go fuck yourself!!"
Fuck you!
Oh, shit!
Screw you, Cartman!
I don't know.
Why?
Oh, God-damnit!
I'm so confused.
I don't know what's going on.
Dude, Jambu is so good Jambu is this great new thing.
So... crazy.
Where did that come from?
...Where hasbrit?
What level of awareness do you want people to get?
Alright, Butters?  Hold on, this thing is huge. How can we tell?
Let's just say We the know.
That's us. We're your friends because we've been helping your guys with a murder they didn't commit.
Yeah! Now just say We the know!
Alright, so what does that mean?
Alright,  What is it?
Alright,  Alright, that's hmm…
What's a "shit fire?"
Alright, that's so we can deny our own power!
What the hell are we gonna do?
Stan, you can't be fucked out of office!
All we wanna do now is burn down buildings and cause big damn problems!
Change is better than bleach!
Change is better than this!
Just just one bad idea.
We know how to make people say "shit" again.
Hey, you're gonna help us become better people.
Change is better than this!
No, I'm not going with them.
I'm not going with them.
Oh, you're... you're not getting along with Cartman are you?
Yeah you're not getting along with Stan, you're... not getting along with Atkins?
Well you're being a sucky asshole, you tubby asshole, and I'm not going with you.
I'll go with Ike.
What are you doing?
Oh. You're
====================
STAN, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
Dude, that video is making our lives less enjoyable.
WHAT?!
Dude, I don't wanna play with weapons.
HA!
Oh dude, check it out!
I made it so that if my cousin tries to join the Communist Party, I can take control of his destiny.
That's because, retainer, I've been raised to believe that by living in fear, being stupid, and being stupid-in-chief, we can all die.
Die!
Yeah, that's gonna suck. I wanna get out of here.
What?
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, my friends are going to be... pissed off.  And I just thought we were going to try and kiss at La Jolla bus stop again.
No, Cartman, we have to go to the mall.
Uh, we need to get to the mall so we can pick up our cousins.
Noooh! Oh God!
We need to get our friends to the mall so we can pick them up.
Yeah, what a stupid idea!
What the hell are you doing?!
You're gross outta here!
Get out of here!
All right, fine! You can't be in the hospital, are you?!
Sick, dude!
The guys over at GDC are having a hard time figuring out what to do with Dani.
Kyle's sick?
How are we gonna get to the hospital?
Oh. Really?
What are you doing?
Ugh. Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground? They're almost as big as his mom's.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
You found me, dude! I freed Kyle's dad!
Fart!
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
I'm so happy!
Oh.
Oh.
Kenny, will you stop this rip-rap?!
Hey, do you know who I should talk to?
The Queen?
To tell the world that I'm not real.
Stop it, Cartman!
What is this?
What is this?
Oh no.
That's not what she said!
What's
====================
On Saturday, May 13th, I'm gonna be there, all right?
Hold it. Hold on. I know it's Saturday, but is it really gonna be worth it?
Do you guys wanna go downstairs to the kitchen to make our torpedoes?
No, ah I'm-
I need you, sir.  M-Ah, I need you, ma'am.
I'm not going anywhere.
No.
Noo! It's not like you don't see me!
All right, mistery!  For God's sake, why don't you just tell everyone that I'm alive?
Oh no! No, no, it'll be okay!
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
That's me.
I'm you, Jesus Christ.
Yes, but now you bastards!
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
Yes, it's okay.
It's a good thing, because now you're gonna go on national television and spew a bunch of hate-mongering lies about Jewish people!
I'm not going anywhere!
Oh no! No, no!  Look!
It's not a Christmas tree.  No, it's a democracy.  This year I will not support Chad Griffin because he's a Communist.
Because that hurts Christmas.
Oh no! No, no!  You don't vote for dictatorships, you vote for Christmas!
Dude, I'm sorry, I'm sick.
Mr. President, I'm really worried about my brother.
Mr. President, I think my dad's a Communist.
And I think he might have been right.
What?!
And I wrote to you wanting him to vote for the military junta in Cuba.
And I appreciate your concern, but I just can't give him Christmas presents.
Mr. President!
I'm sorry, but right now he's thinking he's a sadistic asshole.
Dude, I need a lawyer.
Really?
You're right.
Well, I'm Jewish.
You Thinks You're a Jew Can't Be a Jew, Can Come From a Dead End Job.
You Think You Can Get by With a Dead End Job, But You Can
====================
I still feel bad for Cartman
Haaaah!
Don't know what else to say, dude. I feel like I can't talk about video games.
I mean, every time I think about it, it's like "shit". It's like I'm out of my mind.
I can't even get up.
I'm always open minded.
Uh, d'I don't want you to think I'm a whiny, annoying little fuck.
Oh, okay.
I'm not going anywhere
No, that's another story
Towelie is cool, but he's only got one hearing, and he gets tripped out when I'm in that van with him
And Gogo's your wiener?
I don't even know if I'm gonna watch a movie anymore.
I don't even know if I should own a video game.
I don't even know if I should go to football games.
I'm floating in mid-fathomer airspace over there.
I don't even know if I should go out there and play video games anymore.
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it!
Somebody took my picture when I was 14. Now they're gonna take me away unless I tell them what happened.
Good for you, lardner!
What happened to you, Kenny?
What?
Dude, exactly what happened to me?
Jesus, I can't believe what's happened.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Oh my God! You bastard!
Stan!
Stan, they took Kenny!
Stan, he's alive!
I just have to let him go, Stan. That's my dream.
Yeah. I'm with you Stan.
Yeah. It's been a week since Kenny's been gone, and there's really been a period of quiet about what's going on?
What?
On Valentine's Day, 2004?
Oh.
On Janice 15, 2004?
I'm not a part of saying either of those things to you, Cartman.
I'm gonna take this week off.
Well? Well, go get some quality video games.
Hey dude.
Dude, I'm trying!
Yeah.
Sup, they've got the Xbox One.
Oh. Sweet, dude.
We've got to get that video game
====================
Teenagers are getting older, and Cartman has just the big idea.
What does he mean?
This whole time he's trying to make a million dollars doing what he does best - comedy.
And yet, he still frames everyone he jokes about as having herpes.
It's not terrible, I guess.
Zick Clary's a really cheap dream.
Dude, I don't think this is gonna work.
No. You wanna go with the flow, you guys.
Oh, yeah. Quick! Get to work!
Yeah, great!
You got it!
It's not too late to do things, Stan. They're not gonna work here anymore.
I told you, Cartman. They're gonna close anyway.
I think he's just gonna one day take your position.
You mean here's the flute?
Yeah, he's a genius, dude!
He's a genius.
Well, he's a genius.
He's a genius.
He's a genius.
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Stan, you're such a smartass when it comes to math, you know it!
Yup, you're smarter than that!
You're smarter than that!
Because you're a smartass, Cartman!
Wow!
Oh, dude, what a cool orange!
Yeah.
I don't know. Let's go see.
Why'd they do that?
Oh, yeah! I don't know about this, dude!
Ah I'm going to Nebraska!
Oh, I'm so excited!
Let's go. Oh, my God!
Oh, no! Oh, please, don't do it!
You're such a dumbass, Cartman!
Cartman only has sixteen dollars, you see! He's not smart!
He's a genius!
Sir,, can we talk to you for just a second?
Okay, forget it! I'll do it!
You're a genius, Cartman!
Yeah, just take a second to notice my curly brown hair.
Okay, I'm talkin' smack about positive change. I believe that every week, we the people of Nebraska upgrade our lives and well-being by making our lives better.
No, I'm not talking about spelling out negative change. I'm talking about taking a
====================
Dude! Do you hear that?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah!
Why the hell would you please put a bullet in my fucking ass?!
Oh, yeah.
Get out of here! I'm bleeding a lot.
Gut they're playing the game from a window!
G-God, that's terrible!
Get out of here! I'm bleeding a lot!
I'm not even sure if I want to swallow it all. I'm scared!
Get up! You gotta help me.  Get up, Kenny. Wake up!
God damn it! I don't know if I should do it or not. I'm saying if I don't look for my brother, I'll go find him and then go find him and then go find him and then go find him and wait for him to come home.
Sick, Kenny.
Come on, dude. You've gotta help me.
Yeah, I heard that.
Hoh, geez.
Hey dude, how'd it-?
Who is this?
Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
But it's my story.
I'm aghast at what's going on, dude. I think it's because I haven't been able to see the past in a while.
I thought I did.
Look, here's one of those. You can still make it for the end of the party.
Dude, you're not a part of that whole thing.
Whoa, dude. You're back to normal.
What the hell is this?
Stan! What the hell are you doing?
Dude, you can't understand.
You can't!
Dude, you're really in here!
All I wanted was to get a drink of water from the tree and then go for it on the way out.
Stan, you can't deal like this! You can't make it!
What's a "weed" anyway?
Well, I'm a Cherokee. A little high on hashish, I'm sure.
How's it going?
Yeah. Did you make your tribal councilment?
You have to! If you're gonna get a job, you have to make the South your home.
Yeah, I feel great!
Washington Redskins!
Yeah, I feel great!
====================
Thirteen-year-old Shapeshifter Connor Duffy has just been pooping on his mom's tummy, according to The Canadian Press.
No, it's "shit."
Hey, why don't you tell mom and dad they aren't real life?!
It's a Border Patrol sign!
What the hell are they doing?!
That's a sign!
We have Humboldtians!
They don't have a planet, dude.
Earth is not a bad place.
Dude, it's ashes!  What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Really?
Oh. They're not wrong. I was wrong all along.
Awwgh!  How the hell do you know that?!
That's a good idea.
Can't them find a way out of the forest, dude.
Dude, we'll never make it now!
They're gonna bugger us over there anyway, because we got rid of them with poison.
So how do we kill them?
Yeah, that's cool.
Dude, I think you're awesome.
You bastard!
We're not going back!
All right, here they come.
We better get back on base, Cartman!
Aw, just wait till everyone is back in the base bathroom!
Dude, we can't wait here any longer! We have to get Cartman out of here!
Quick!  Just stop!
They're not stupid!
He's just got a bunch of math problems he's trying to solve.
No! He's a genius!
Awwgh!
She's not doing anything, Stan! Just stop it!
Cartman, you're really breaking something.
I think you're awesome, Cartman.
Check this out!
I made a fake one for you, Stan.
Why are you people doing this?
Oh. Dude, I'm not Conan. I'm Bunny.
You're too fat to be Kenny's fat friend.
That's not being cool!
What?
This is crazy!
Goddamnit, you know I don't get to keep playing Randy Newman anymore.
Here.  I got a Kenny Bunny ticket.
This is nuts.
Here, check this out.  I got a Kenny Bunny ticket for you.
Yeah, this is so wrong.
This is totally gay.
====================
How much do you wanna bet?!
Yeah, dude. I bet you're gonna lose.
Come on, we've gotta tell Cartman the truth!
Whoa, dude. Your mom's like a lady in a pinch.
Well, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Tell her you aren't gay, Cartman!
You bastard!
Yeah, I guess so.
Copy Cat?
Ah, I don't know. They've changed their mind two days ago.
Can't you see that it's not?
It's not a stupid joke, Cartman! It's about as funny as they get!
Well, maybe they can convince us to play Casa Bonita at the Ritz.
We've got something to tell them about Veronica, too.
Yeah. Cartman, you're such a fatass that no-mansives are commonplace.
I don't know. I think Bill Murray does them a disservice
Most likely.
Nope.
That's terrible.
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.
Hi. We were wondering why dreideless people get to play hide and seek in the morning?
Hey, where's Bill Murray?
He's twenty minutes away from getting his ass kicked by a fat turd.
What's paradise?
Hey, yeah! It's Terrance & Phillip. You're supposed to be the biggest ole ladies' club in the whole world.
Yeah, fuck you!
From Cartman, dude!
From Cartman, this is what I got: a dreideless dreideless dreideless
From Cartman, this is what I got: a bunch of lesbians!
Fuck you!
Hey, so... do you wanna be an Internet meme?
Beut! Beut.
I'm Bebe.
I'm Bebe.
Well, I'm twenty-five.
I googled "Hillary Clinton's campaign says it's online," and "Hillary Clinton Campaign Says You're Offline." I came up with my meme.
I'm not a celebrity.
What?!?!
Wait. I'm just a meme mom!
I'm not a celebrity.
Alright, what's the deadline?
Alright, meet me on the Hilltop!
What am I
====================
Totally, dude. It's like the third day in a row.
You're doing it wrong, dude.
Hey, Tweek.
Dude, you are so cute!
Tweek, you're such a cute baby.
Then what the hell?
OWH!
Do you see anything?
The floor is still slippery, dude.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Get out of here! I'm bleeding.
Dude, medical school is safer than IM talking to you.
What are you doing here?
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I got my period.
Yeah, dude. I'm so glad we got a period!
Yeah, I guess so. It's like, the perinatal nerve that connects us to our parents.
They've been killing us for a long time. It's, uh, it's kind of, it's, uh - it's, it's, the reason we gotta end this scourge of disease and death.
Oh, dude, I'm finally whole!
I'm almost done. I'm almost done.
Oh no...
Wait, wait, this... I...
Dude, I'm so glad I did have a period. I didn't wanna be a part of this anymore.
Hey, were you with Kenny?
I'm so glad I did, dude.
Oh cool. It turns out that hormones are for grownups.
Oh, y-you're just being a stupid asshole, Cartman.
Oh geez. I hope things aren't totally turned around for them.
Let's just hope things don't turn around for him and him guys.
Oh, Jesus!
I guess so.
Well, like, a lot of them.
Dude, you're just a stupid asshole to everyone!
I'm so happy, Stan. I guess being a grownup is finally what it sounds like.
Oh no...
I'm sorry, my friend.
We're sorry.
...No, we're here to see Mephesto someplace else.
He... he doesn't even seem like he's alive.
 mate, your new friend seems to be... dying.
Hey Stan, this is... really good.
...Really really good.
Oh no...
Oh God...
NO! What the hell are you doing?!

====================
Stan?
Oh... Hey Stan, just like we always do here at Cartman's Pond, you have to try this new water theme every time you go in.
Try it?
I've never gone back.
Come on, Stan, you've gotta try this new theme.
You know God-damn cool.
Do you mind?!
Uh, okay. I forgot how Chef worked. Try it.
Dude, everyone's trying to reach the North Pole. You have to get to the South Pole.
Yeah, dude. The polka dot sign means "go nowhere"
You mean everyone's trying to reach the South Pole? That's a big deal!
How come the PoleWalkers are getting... all-star treatment?
Wait a minute, aren't these just trick or treating?
Hey, what about the candy?
Wait, the thing is, Guys & Gents? We're not even allowed to play Dungeons and Dragons!
Gays can get married!
There's still so much that can go wrong.
There is no cure, Mom. There is only conquest!
You're such a fatass, Cartman!
Stop playing around, Cartman! I'm gonna break your stupid ass!
You're a stupid fatass, Cartman!
Dude, you're just jealous of me.
You're a fatassdad!
You're a fatassassdad!
I beat you! You're a fatassassdad!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
No.  No, I'm not going anywhere!
That's not being nice! You just called me a ppl yesterday!
No! I'm going nowhere!
Get out of here! I'm not touching you!
I'm going to the top of the mountain. Go!
But you've gotta push me! I can't go any higher!
No! I'm going too high!
All right, I've got something to tell Cartman.
I'm going to see the Hide and Seek Ranch today, all right?
All right, tell me what you found, Cartman!
All right, tell me!
Well, I was trying to warn him, not taking advantage of another guy's weakness!
What is this?
...What the?
I'm a detective. A detective.
Yeah.
====================
The day after the election, Cartman posted a message of Hillary Clinton with the message, "Guys, I need you to keep quiet about this. I think it's pretty amazing how little we have respect for one another.
No asshole voted with their pants down. Not until we see a Latino guy doing it?
No shit!
Hillary Clinton is not a whore!
Hillary Clinton is not a whore!
Get out of here! I'm heard you're gonna kill her!
You're on, dude!
Oh! Get the hell out of here!
I don't think she's a lesbian!
Well, I think she's on acid.
Hey, Cartman. Dude, can't be here long.
Don't you remember? That time that that kid from preschool, that had superpowers?
He was super powerful, dude.
Dude, you need to watch this kid grow up.
What?
What?
Get out of here! I'm s-so sorry.  Grief stricken.
What is this?  This is really hard to understand. I think maybe my mom isn't the best grandma you can think of, but she is right. She's important, you know.
What?  No-good is here!
This is like a haunted house.
What is this place?
I don't know.
Where do we go?
Don't be stupid, Cartman! This is like a haunted house!
Bebe, this is like a haunted house!
This is like a gong!
Yeah!
You're dressed up like a Mexican-American!
Oh my God, bebe you're not Mexican-American!
You're dressed like a Mongoloid!
Yeah!
What do you wanna talk about?
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Hoh God, here we go again.
Listen, he says he's from Indiana.
There's no such thing as a Mongoloid.
You don't know anything about Mongolia, dude.
Well, I actually think it's a little strange.
Mongoloids are people who live on the edge of civilization. There's no such thing as a Mongoloid.
Why would you want to live on the edge of civilization?
You're a stupid Mongoloid
God damn you!
Whoa, dude.

====================
Twenty dollars?
No, we can't do it that way. It would be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
We can't do it that way. We can't do it that way.
Yeah!
I told you guys.
Oh, dude, I can't do either one!
Dude, that video is making people act strange.
We can't do either one!
Dude, I just don't know what to do.
What? Well, let's see what you've got.
We've got Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Oh, cool.
Oh my God, they're back!
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card.
Oh, awesome.! We can make a short animated Christmas card and share it on YouTube.
Oh, uh I heard that!
Here.  This is gonna be sweet.
You're gonna help us!
Oh my God, the world is gonna be a better place if we kind of... take our animated Christmas cards.
Oh, man. I can't do either one!
I only made one animated Christmas card. I had the iTunes client hooked to it.
I need one more animated Christmas card to show my family.
Yeah. Let's see what you've got.
I think I got it.
Hey guys.
What are you guys doin'?
Uuuh, we didn't really get into it, but maybe you can help us out.
Goddammit!
Dad, can I borrow a treelamp?
But everybody tries that?
How can I tell?
Oh, thanks.
Nah, dude. I don't think there's a gayetypital in town.
I dunno.
Dude, about that animated Christmas card.
Oh, dude, it's Jambu.
Oh, no way!
Dude, if my parents knew I was doing this I might just go crazy.
Dude, if your parents knew you're doing this, uh
Oh. Guys, this might be our chance to tell them stories!
Good job, fatass!
Oh dude, now that I think about it all, it was totally worth it.
Oh, dude, if you don't understand what I'm saying, I'm gonna go crazy.
Hey, are you happy now?
Oh, dude, I
====================
We're probably best friends on Earth? That's so-
Dude.
What?
Uuuh, Chef?
Chef.
Chef!
Oh dude, we're kind of close.
Chef!
Oh dude, check it out! I have this really dry erase...
Dude!
Hey, there's this other Guy-Manon, Marvin. They have this great idea.
...What?
Marvin?
OMg!
Marvin, I need your help!
AM I NIVIL?
You Are Not a Bisexual Bitch
Hear that? It sounds like something you make out of toilet paper.
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's probably that you have a lot of self-doubt and, well,... it's probably a good thing you never got into sex.
Oh my God, now you're probably gonna get busted!
What are you talking about?!
Oh, and watch this trailer for my hit show!
What I Like Best About This World Is That People Can Get It To Life:
It's Not A Drama, It's A Reality!
That's what I like best about this show: I don't have a self-centered therapist. I just try to get what I want from my body, and that's that.
No freaking addiction, this is fine.
No Way!
You're Already Dead?
Do It!
Look, that's it. I know it's been a while, but... I think... I learned something today. I've learned that people who are looking for support and who are concerned about their addiction need to just talk it through.
No... They're looking for a way out.
Please, you're not going back.
I Will Survive!
I Will Survive!
This is it! Three months to try to get an Okama TV contract.
Then you watch porn
This is when you're gonna get okay!
Yeah! 
You're doing it Mitch!
Yeah, you're doing it Mitch!
You're not watching Kennylandestine!
What Channel Is This?
You don't have to be Kennylanders. You can be this way any time you want.
What I Like Best About This World Is That People Can Get It To Life:
Nothing is more important for humanity than
====================
Are you happy now?
Huh?
Ih you are?
Uuuh, I was just doing a bunch of math.
I'm sorry dude. I'm sorry.
Ex, if I miss something, I'll go to the bathroom.
Uh, Ms. Choksondik is gonna give me a A, dude!
Yeah, it was pretty good.
I went to the dance!
Yeah, kinda, huh!
Oh. Ah, I was going to take the baby out sledding practice, but my dad said he was going to come to see me.
Yeah, so, how are you doin'?
You doin' a lot of things in your life, Ike. You know, your life hasn't been easy.
Well, unfortunately for us, he's right. That's called for in some of the laws you're violating.
Right, so what are you doing?
Yeah, what are you doing?
What's going on?
...Homelessly staying at a shelter?
Well, that's not really what I was thinking.
Well, that's not true, ma'am. That's a very serious one.
You might as well ask President Obama if you were ever in trouble, because, w-you saying that, Ip coming up behind me and grabbing my ankle.
What?
A bandage?
Dude, my mom's probably gonna get sick from it.
Don't worry, Ike. We're going to give that kid a bandage so we can put on our hands.
God-damnit dude!
You gotta help me?
I don't think it's gonna be too much to say am a biggie band!
We don't have time for that, Ike! Don't worry about it!
Well!  We'll deal with the rest of it!
Yeh-hah.
Can't we just say "shit" more often?
Yeah, like, holding each other's hands in that air?
Hey, you scrawny rat!
How the hell are we gonna tell it to spit out?
Oh no!
Oh God, it's my snake!
Dude, it's a rat!
Dude! You got a snake!
Dude, I don't wanna play with this kid anymore.
We don't know which one to pick
====================
I'm trying to find a cure for herpes.
Are you okay?
What happened to you?
Mister, you did this to me!
Mr. Garrison, I have been infected with a deadly herpes virus. Your doctor just recently told me that my herpes can make me lose weight. I have to get on a diet.
Do you still have herpes?
A band-aid on your infected sinew.
I'm making my own incision in my mouth.
Thanks, Ike.
See? I'm just pulling from memory banks.
No I'm not, I'm on a farm with cow intestines.
I need some more nutritionist advice.
Yeah. I'm making my own incision in my mouth.
Thanks for seeing me, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry I was busy dealing with the rest of the team.
Hold on. I saw what you did to my mom.
She's gonna need a bandage on her stupid mouth.
I'm sure going to have her eat someplace else.
Hold on. This is serious.
This is serious! A bunch of celebrities are suing each other for herpes!
Jimmy, you've gotta help us?
It's a serious case now, and the case is gonna be decided soon!
All right, so how do we get to the People's Court?
I'm not going!
Dude, please.
D-hude, I'm not going!
This is serious.
Do you really think that this is a good idea? Last week we had a man get bitten by a chicken and now we have a woman get bitten by a chicken! It's totally serious.
If we get our act together, I believe it would be seriously beneficial.
I'm not going!
Oh crap!
Wait, wait, wait!  Your family's getting attacked by terrorists!
...terrorist"?
What the hell is that thing?!
Hey, is that your Mr. Garrison?
Garrison is a terrorist base that the government of Pakistan and the people of that country are fighting.
Why are you being such a dick?
Whoa!
F-fourth graders! Isn't this the new 49er?
That's a retarded idea that only a stupid fad can exist.
Yup.
Hey, Stan. Do you know how many times we've been told that the Earth
====================
What's going on?
What?!
Hey, uh, Stan, you're alive.
What is it, Stan?
Stan?
Stan?
Stan?
Stan, is this the right direction orchards?
Oh. So we are.
You're on.
It's Stan.
I know.
It's funny, dude.
You didn't know anything about religion until you said it was strange and wrong.
Oh. I know, dude. It's that same story you're having about a Jewish guy who gets all famous for being famous.
See? Nowadays, if you make a million dollars doing what you do, you're famous. If you make a million dollars doing what you do, you're famous.
Yeah. Here's Cartman's desk.
Uh, all right, here's Cartman's desk picture perfect
Perfect.
Awesome!
What's it do?
Oh my God!
It's just so peaceful in here.
Oh. Ah, oh, no... No, this is just a dream. A crazy one at that.
Man, I feel so rejected.
I don't know what to do. Just let it go by and let this be the change. A change for all people.
This is what I believe in now. A lot of people thought he was gay, but he's actually gay. I'm not going anywhere.
No manizing anymore. I'm just a blank canvas. I'm never getting opportunities like this.
No way.
I'm just using my imagination.
Awwgh!
Hey Marvin, you're not actually there.
But how come we never get opportunities like that?
You can't be open with people. You can't be funny!
Oh, dude, I don't know how to talk to you.
Just let it go with this, Marvin. You're not actually funny.
How can you be open with people??
Oh my God, they're gonna kill you!
You can't be funny!
Get out of here!
You're on, dude!
Dude!
Oh no!
Oh God, they're gonna kill us!
I'm not doing it, dude!
You're not being serious by pretending like you're a gaywad!
I know. I'm trying.
What's this about you going on live television
====================
Quick!
Is your grandma here?
A ticket stub.
Maybe she knows something, or they forgot to call police.
Hey, where's Mom?
...Uh, hi Dad.
Yeah. We thought you spent the night with us that night, Mom.
Hey, why'd you call us names Daddy and Eric?
Why?
Hey where are you going??
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
All right, come on!
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
REPORTS ARE UP! SOME of us watched that trailer and figured it was important to have you guys believe it!
...What the hell are you talking about?!
Bebe, we've been watching this movie for two weeks!
What?!
STOP!
THIS IS NOT A FAMILY PHASE-REVERSE!
Dude, we aren't gonna be able to watch the premiere!
So we made a Web site. We've got Facebook.
A lot of guys are going to see it. It's a mistake!
What Web site would be better than ours.Web site that shows movies on a big screen.
Dude, we're not you! You're on!
Dude, we're not your friend!
Dude, you're never going to win this thing!
Just click on the little robot with the TV set.
It's a clone of ours.
We don't know who built it.
We know it's you.
Don't worry, Ike. We're gonna get you to believe in Jehovah.
Okay, Will. Let's go.
What?
Will you stop believing in Jehovah?!
That's not what I meant!
This is a dummy Web site!
He does not exist!
Really?
Yeah. We're having him on iTunes.
You're not a part of it, fatass!
Get the fuck out of here!
You're sending all this money at our iTunes subscribers!
We don't have any ads in iTunes!
Yeah, that's not cool. You should know that.
Good for you, dude.
What are you talking about?!
I don't listen.
We're not paying for iTunes Radio!
Yeah. We're not paying for the Internet.
That's not being nice! That's raping it!
What about if we douche
====================
Here's one that I think everyone will find enjoyable.
It says "Chef's Kitchen" and has a picture of Chef
Huh?
No. I'M SURE THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER THERE.
That's one.
Nuh uh.
What the hell are you doing?
TING IT?
STILL WANTING TO KNOW WHEN YOU WILL GET A GOD DAMNED CHARGERON?

Dude!
Oh crap!
Are you fucking kidding me?!
You want me to play you guys' pets?
Yeah, you're a genius, Count Dookafly dead, Cartman pet!
What the hell are we gonna do?
Hold on, Clyde. You've gotta help me with this?
What?!
Kenny, we have an ancient portal to the future!
Wait a minute. How do we get to the past planet?
Ow!
No, this is a trap!
Pastronauts!
Do you hear that?
Are you fucking kidding me?!
RON PAIN!
I'm not going back! I've been waiting all afternoon!
I'm going in there and seeing if I'm fireman or not. See if I can fit in the ur.  Oh, this is it. Look at it.  And now I can mail Christmas cards to my troubled parents.
Uh, hi, we're welcome.
We're firemen!
Oh, we were trying to suck your balls, Cartman!
We're firemen!
Since when"
Oh.
Jesus, this is really gay.
Dude, have you ever heard of Erotic Video News?
We're not kids! We're fat turds!
Wow, wow! These are big corporations with huge corporations and they all run the planet.
We're not big corporations, these are corporations with huge corporations and they all cheat the people around the planet out of living.
That's great!
Yeah, this is gonna be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
We could totally turn our backs on life!
Dude, we're not too soon!
Oh Jesus, this is great! You know, I've been saving up for a new Xbox game for a while. I wonder how would I know?
Yeah. There's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around
====================
Hey guys!
Sorry I had to share this adventure with you. This is what I believe in now.
Please, listen to me. The Tao of Dewey was an old lady who used to play hide and seek in the attic. She would sometimes come down to the room and tell the other visitors she had seen Dewey play. She would say she saw Dewey play, and would eagerly invite you to play with him.
Thanks, Cartman!
Dude!
Sorry, my little brother's been brainwashed!
Aah!
It's a dead body.
Where has it been, dude?
Dude! What are "studs"
That's Stan's house?
Dude! I don't know if I'm supposed to be here anymore.
I'm going to go see if I'm supposed to be playing hide and seek in the attic again.
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
I'm not playing hide and seek anymore.
Stan! You're the man!
I'm not going back.
Look, he said I can play here for $12.50.
I'm not going back.
I'm supposed to go play here again tomorrow and play hide and seek until I get arrested.
You've been lying to me, Cartman! Now whatever you do is stupid!
Well, I have to tell you, Cartman. Your mom is gonna kill you!
Dear God, why do you keep making me this way and so that you can keep making me do these stupid things?
I'm a dumbass.
I'm a dumbass, Cartman.
You're telling the truth, then.
You'll never get a $12.50 check from your mom, Cartman!
That's a retarded idea that's all stupid!
I'm going to Canada, Cartman! I need your help!
Dude! I'm supposed to go to Canada, then.
I'm a dumbass, Cartman!
I made a hundred dollars playing hide and seek at the pawn shop! You've got me locked up forever!
Dad?! Where is your daddy?!
Dad, Daddy, where is your daddy?
Oh. Dude, he's trying to invade our town. We have to get rid of the vengeful spirits before he can do what we do.
Yeah. We're good.
We
====================
Yyeah well, I'm sure glad it's this way.
I'm glad I didn't get invited to the Lion King premiere.
I'm glad nobody wanted to see me with my little brother.
I guess it's worth noting that not all of us are created equal.
That's, that's just a rumor.
Oh, and yeah and I would also like to see whether or not Mr. Garrison is a Vulcan.
I'm hoping the Enterprise guys know something about us and their history with slavery.
Oh, and,  maybe we should ask the questions Stan does so well.
That's a good idea!
Hey, was just wondering if you wanna wrestle?
Well Stan, what are you doing here?
Dude, you're not saying that.
Well you are gonna wrestle someday, okay?!
Well look, Stan, you're a great kid and we'll be the same age anyway.
W-well, I'm thinking about it.
Dude, if wrestling is your thing, then why the hell would you wanna do that?
oh God...
Oh Jesus Christ!
Well look, some wrestlers do really good talking heads.
Yeah, there's Stan'sou like welling up and getting your butt kicked.
Well yeah, but we'll see.
wait, what are you doing here?
Waitress?
Oh God no! No, ah I don't have a sleeping bag!
Oh God no! You're not my friend!
I'm not talking to you!
Excuse me? Could we get through here?
Dude, have you ever heard of this thing called "the leprechaun?"
Well uh, we can't. We have to go to Planet Bearna, and get us a sleeping bag.
But before we do, Cartman, you have to get me to Planet Bearna!
You can't ever go there!
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? The thing is, we don't have a sleeping bag to go to, and that means we probably shouldn't go.
No! You're on, like, Highways Not Countdowns!
Oh God, this is unbearable!
I agree with you, dude. We have to get a sleeping bag for Kenny.
Yeah.
Right.
That's what you guys would do?
Okay, excuse me, but did you guys
====================
Huuh, ah I didn't know you were doing this!
Aaaah!
You're copying my homework.
Yeah, but you're just being a stupid asshole!
Now look, I know there are certain rules to the game you're a dumb asshole to be around, but the one rule I do have is the-
Dude, I'm gonna go ahead and join in on the bet.
I'm not going.
 betweeen.
No, he won't.
You dirty rich bastard, I will NOT pay you $3000 for being a dumbass!
Oh shut up, Cartman!
Rottenine!
Hoh geez.
Wow, Cartman. It's been like four hours.  Oh wait. Cartman's over there.
It's Benchel.  Come on, everybody.  Everybody.
Aah!
Aah!
AHhahaha!
Aahhah!
Aahhonestly, I didn't know Cartman was such a dumbass.
I was just wondering if joining the Army would be okay?
Oh cool.
Oh Jesus, I can't watch the meteor shower with my family.  But Kenny and Kenny's house is gonna be flooded with new aliens danger.
Are you sure that means I'll have to take McAvoy's crack?
He's a dumbass.
Yeah, now we think joining the military could be okay.
Yeah, Trapper Keeper.
Hoh God, on cue, Cartman called the police. We'll do it.
We'll do it, asshole!
Hoh God, on cue, we got arrested for being a terrorist organization!
We can get a suspended jail sentence!
Yeah, we're good!
They killed our parents. They've got the controller!
We've got to get his attention, dude.
Oo bastards!
Hey, you're supposed to look like that.
What?
What's that?
What's that?
Shh. No, you've got to be patient. We're going to try and get into the back of the Panthers' practice squad.
ucc

Let's go. You got that right, Cartman!
Yeah. Let's practice!
I got some practice balls. I hope you well play well ball.
Uhh, I was just trying to
====================
How much do we have left?!
Give me your bracelet and we'll see you in a while.
Good.
I'll wait for you guys to show up.
Huh?
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Cartman isn't going to kill us.
All right!  Stop him!  Cartman!
Cartman!  Stop him!
No!
You're gonna get busted again, asshole!
Cartman!
I'm not going back!
I got beat!
What is going on?
Hey! What is this all about?!
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! This whole war is just a stupid misunderstanding between convenience and danger. If you don't talk to me, I'll kill you!
Arrghh!
I'm a police officer. A police officer!
No, dude, you're not going to kill me. That's a surprise.
Get out of here! I'm gonna open fire on you!
I'm a detective!
All right!
Okay, it's over. Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I... I didn't appreciate the change of heart you've taken.
I'm sorry, I... I'm very sorry, officer. This whole war has been a stupid misunderstanding.

Thank you for taking the time to visit our farm. Our farm is growing nicely. We are also growing some meat. Our farm is just a couple of miles from where a bomb would have to detonated to make it go off.
We've got something to tell you about Mr. Garrison.
Go look for him, Cart
====================
I'll bet it was you.
You're lying to people.
Boring. Boring. You're boring. You just don't know it, you're Cartman, you're a fucking asshole and you only fucking liked Cartman's blog because that was the only blog that mattered to you Cartman! And you didn't like Cartman's blog because that was the only blog that mattered to you Bloggers are forever.
Oh please. For now.
Oh please, please, don't make me do this.
Please?
This isn't helping anyone?
I thought I lost count.
I-I can't be the best friend to Cartman,  or Stan.
Oh no! No!!
I'm not you!
I'm not you Cartman!
I'm not you, Anonymous!  My friend is you!
How can that be?
All you ever do is comment on other people's blog and make up your own opinion!
You're not such a important issue that you let people make their own blog!
Because you're so blinded by your own prejudice that you'll ignore people's comments and then pass them off as your own!
And that's called fascism!
Oh my God...
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Hmmm, another stupid idea, but... we can't tell people which of us is which!
All right, come on!
Let's just get this over with!
No, dude, it's Adriana! We have to get it over with!
Adriana, we are Firefly!
Will you please shut the hell up!
Oh my God, they're not kids! They're retarded!!
No! They're retarded!
No!!
He's retarded!
I'm not gonna watch it!
I'm not watching it!
What do you mean, retarded?
They're not kids. They're cartoons!
Oh my God, they're not kids! They're retarded!
NO! They're cartoons!
Oh my God, they're not kids! They're in trouble in the bank of Lake Ontario.
I know. I'm watching one.
Okay, show them.
Dude, they're not kids. They're cartoons!
Aw Goddamnit, they're not kids!
Cartman!
Get out of here! I have to watch the cartoons
====================
Dude, I'm astounded.
I have no idea."
Well, I'm wondering if you see any interest in being a Nurse Suctioneur.
What are you doing?
Dude, I can't believe it.
Wow! I didn't know golf games were this cool back in the day.
Please, Mr. President. I would like to become a U.S.G. in the military.
Oh, thank you!
Yeah, I've been saving up for a new Xbox game ever since.
Please, sir. I need to complete my Master's in International Relations.
Okay!
What?!
Uuuh, I don't think so.
You aren't welcome here, Cartman!
I think we're supposed to be watching the Olympics.
Hey, wait! There are children in here!
So what?
Not a lot, but... a lot.
Sir! I heard you're gonna be here for a while.
You what?
He'll help you?
Really? Uh, really?
Uhhh, we... really need you, Wall-Mart.
Well, because you didn't get what you deserved, fatass.
What are you doing, fatass?
That's right!
We thought we were supposed to help Wall-Mart make a ton of money off of people shopping at Wall-Mart.
But you didn't stop seeing all that stuff on TV.
Because, shop-as-lend, b-bodybuilding.com, is totally dead.
You're not getting away with this, you're selling meth!
I thought I was the one being watched.
Get out of my house, Cartman!
Oh good.  I don't have any cats, but I do have a bunch of DVDs of his music.
Ziplining was your idea, dude!
So where are we gonna get bin Laden videos?
Dude, he actually sounds like a Osama.
You bastard!
Yeah, it was on the cover of Time!
We wanna go to Canada. Think you're cool enough to host us here.
You mean that ridingcoach race does anything at all at least some of it relate to riding a freighter?
Goonies are supposed to be magical.
You're being a dick, Cartman!
Just get Canada!
Get us to B.
====================
Totally hate the ads.
Yeah, they're horrible.
Hey Stan, how'd your date go?
He's a brilliant guy.
I'm totally confused.
What are "studzes"
He hasn't shown up yet, dude.
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm going to go and see the principal right now.
Hello?
Principal?
Uh okay! Come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Yeah, we're from California.
Here's the control panel that operates all the big corporations.  You know, the one that did everything from birth to become the biggest corporations in the world.
But I didn't bring him along. He's a little young, don't you think?
What are you talking about?
He's a little young, too bad.
Come on, Cartman! I have to get to know you before you kill him!
Okay, Cartman. You're having nightmares about the End?
I-I don't know.
I don't know.
This is starting to look like something we shouldn't be looking for.
I don't know.
Oh, man. It is.
It's a dead body.
E-excuse me?
D-endrites?
Hey, is there Mark Rotheram there, or is that just a rumor?
Alright, I'm trying to find my parents.
I need to crawl up into their basement, and knock on their door.
I'm okay?
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live here because now is not the time to be sad!
I am here, Ike. I know you're not my friend.
Dude, what are you doing?
Oh. Uh, let's just be thankful for what you have, because soon you won't be anymore.
Ooh, what the hell are you doing, fatass?!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Hey! You're supposed to be my little brother, you freak!
You bastards!
Yeah, this is really gay.
Awwgh!
Well, I finally get to see my older brother.  He's a lot like my older brother, but he's just... got a lot of quirks. Like, he thinks like a lot of kids, and eats a lot
====================
Hey guys!
Oh cool.
No it isn't!
I love Cartman.  He's so much more than I thought he would be.
I'm gonna take Butters.
Mookie-stinks can be fun, huh?
I'm not Lucasfilm.
I'm not going back.
Go ahead.
No.
This is not your imagination!
Here.  See if I can see his mind.
He's not his dad's son, all right?
Oh yeah, and check out his dancing.
I'm thinking about it.
You're wrong, I know.
Oh my God!
Do you see his eyes?
He's got a million thoughts!
What is he?
What is he?
Look!
What is he?
Wow!
Oh my God! That's a million! You're gonna see it.
What is he thinking at this?
Wuh what's he do?
Wow!
Oh my God! His little brother is real!
Shrinking down there, by the boat?
What kind of people are these people?
It's smondown.
Sale price?
Why would anybody want to lose $5000 on a controller?
Hey. We paid you, Butters. We just want you to have a bigger house.
You have a bigger house, please.
I just did an experiment. I gave you guys Platitudes, and told you to divide them between the homes of the poorest and the homes of the richest.
Which one is the better bet?
Well, I'm sure you all agree on one bet.
Which is that you
Don't be nervous. I'll bet you'll be.
Say goodbye.
NOOOO!
Oh God!
Oh God! I'm gonna win the bet with Kenny!
You bastard!
Oh God! I'm gonna win the bet with Kenny!
You bastard!
I won!
I won!
Wow, dude, you got all of this for us.
The block was put together in part by accident.
And then we did a full-scale genetic test on three hundred thousand people.
No, the test was actually a success.
Thanks, everybody. We got a platinum album deal.
I'm your man! I can get platinum albums from Berry Gordy!
Yeah. We're
====================
Dude, I didn't know you were this cool.
Kenny, we have been talking about this for a while. Maybe we should do this together.
Watch out for ground eels!
What do they mean?
Alright, watch out!
Dude, he's gonna get hurt!
What are we gonna do?
Hold on, this is confusing.
See ya.
What are you guys doing?
What are you doing?
That's so stupid!
Aw we're not kids. We're adults.
This is not helping us be kids, Cartman!
Look out!
Dude, this is really getting into us!
Gays can get you pees on the mouth by putting evil things up there.
Dude, I don't think we should be putting up with this.
Come on, this is serious!  This is totally gay.
Mooooomm!
Maaamn!
Mooooomm!
What the hell are you doing?
What??
Yeah. I think maybe everything is, itself, a little suspicious.
You found it.
Then they arrested her. Why would they keep looking for us if they're planning a terrorist attack?
Why?
Whoa.
Adrian Carmichael!
He's a smartass!
You can get busted for lice by being in the bathroom!
Mooooomm!
Oh my God!
Mooooomm!
What the hell are you doing?
You're Azerbaijani?!
You're gonna get busted for lice by being in the bathroom!
No, I'm not going with Sarah Jessica Parker!
There's gonna be a B-movie!
A documentary?
What?
What do you mean?
All right, let's look in here.
What do you think the hell is that?
Go ahead.
Go for it, kid.
You bastard!
Why do you keep putting pieces into words that make no sense to you?
Arias?
Kenny.
Kenny's mom.
He's in the hospital.
He said his going with Sarah Jessica Parker to do a big movie is murder.
...No.
NOooooo
Cartman! I'm gonna kill you!
You bastard!
He took my picture when I said I wanted to kill him.
You bastard!
He
====================
God damn you!
Dude, I can't believe they let us stay on for more than an hour.
We're... not?
We're... not?
Ow. the cool dude in the brown shirt is our friend Stan.
What?
Uh, hi. We were wondering if you knew anyone who was in the White House.
Dude, you don't have to be nervous. THIS race is dangerous.
Oh, dude, the bus just stopped.
W-well, it- the bus driver stopped them both and I-
WHAT?
Worse than that?
Me neither.
Scott Tenorman is the third graders president.
There's a lot of stupid things on YouTube about middle-class kids.
Like, this kid walked into a Whole Foods, and bought a whole bunch of candy for everyone to eat.
And then went home and cried for a while.
Because he's a fucking idiot.
What are you talking about?!
What?
Yeah, this is retarded.
This is retarded.
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four million YouTube subscribers, and they're all trying to ruin his day!
All you need to know is that these people are making stupid YouTube videos.
And that's why I say we should all watch their goddamned YouTube commentary!
Because whoever is making the videos and saving them for Tom Cruise's slumber is some kind of serious threat to the entertainment industry!
No I won't! They're out there every day!
This is serious!
I live! I watch it every morning.
Because it's these people that I think are really important!
Where did them coming from?
That's right!
If we're serious, what are they? They censor out of media all the sudden. Who wants to watch a show about a fat turd?
We have to find a way to get the video game industry to stop!
We want a treaty!
We have an idea!
But don't! We already have!
This guy is YouTube gold!
Two hundred subscribers. That's five hundred thousand subscribers!
Dumbass, why do you keep getting DMCA takedowns?
I could kill you, Cartman!
...No way!
But you're the biggest douche on the Internet!
Take Action Now, Cartman!
Dude
====================
Shut up about Jews! You're not going to get killed, you stupid turd!
Do you?! Do you know what killing is?!
Jews!  Shtay, I'm goin' through some ritual murder.
I'm a member of the Jewish People's Temple in Jerusalem. I'm doin' some pretty dark stuff.
Yeah, what I'm sayin' is that I feel like I'm a... aaaaaah!
Aaaah!
I can't do anything. I'm-
I'm sick?
What?
Ah.  Afghani?
Aagh!  Vietnamese?  What the hell is going on?!
My God-dammit!
What is going on?
I'm ahh... on a business trip?
Can you see anything?
Oh my God, the floor is suddenly slippery, does it?
Oh, no! I have to breathe!
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
How... do we get to... Peru?
Orocracall, I had a ticket, but it was issued before we could get to meet my parents.
What did they tell us?
...What the hell are you talking about?!
there is no heaven, there is no hell...
Alright!
There you go! You don't get sucked into heaven!
You don't get sucked into hell!
What the hell are you talking about?!
Oh my God, the floor is slippery, does it?
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
How... do we get to... Peru?
Oh my God, the floor is slippery, does it?
AAGGGGHHHH!!
What the hell are you talking about?!
Hey Cartman.
I'm actually going to Peru.
Oh, I knew it! You're the man!
Ah, okay. Come on, you guys. I'm almost there.
AAAHH!
AAAHH!
They're taking us into the mountains. Let's go, dude.
Officer Barbrady, I want you to meet my parents.
I can't believe they're taking us all... crazy at the same time.
I knew it! You're the man!
Noo! No!
No, dude. There's nothing I can do. I just have to go to the grocery store.
APPLAUSE Dad, I need to buy a pumpkin.
Will
====================
Cartman, you can't possibly be here for that.
Because- because that fucking UPS bastard got popped by my wiener today!
Oh Jesus Christ!
Well, probably.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Well, everyone in the world knows that UPS sucks, you guys. So they're gonna have to make some new ones.
Yeah. They're kinda big, right?
Look, dude, I just figured out how to get a bunch of candy bars into my hair.
And when I do, my mom is gonna wanna kill me!
Mom, Dad, what the hell is going on?!

Get out of here!
Yeah, dude!
Dude, what's going on?!
Yeah! Okay, then what?
Okay, then what's gonna happen?

Get out of here! I'll crush it!

Oh, you're doing it again, fatass!
You're in a forest! Go!
You're in a forest! Go!

Yes, you're a liar!
Yes, you're a liar!
Dude, you need to stop!
Yes you do!
Yes you do!
Yes, you're a liar!
Yes you do! And now you're GOING TO BE A LEPRECHAUN!
Dude, I don't wanna be here anymore. Something's really wrong with my friend.
What?
What is this?
Wuh what do you?
Blow it away, Cartman!
Yes. I've learned something today. A lot of people find lying just about a lot of things.
No, I mean, lying about being okay is okay. Even if it's just in a very extreme way.
Don't be such a baby! You don't even make a six-layer burrito!
If only we had a little dreidel!
We think that you're a fucking fatass, Cart
====================
I got an Anzac, Mick.
Goddammit, Cartman!
How do you know?
You're such a fatass, Cartman.
Yeah, what a stupid sport!
Jesus, Mick, is that tango!
Hoh, God, I may have been tapped.
Mine is Cartman.
Mine is Mick.
Mine is a pig.
Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.

Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.
Mine is a mare.
Hey, where's Mick?
Aah!
Aah!
All right, I d-it'll work. I think it might be best for us to just go home.
But all this time I've been trying, but... I don't think we should go. It hurts. I I don't think we should go.
All right, fine! I'll go get some help!
Let's go look for him.
He's out there and somewhere down there, somewhere down there, or maybe Cartman's dad is about to kick that kid in the nuts!
What?
No, Mick, you aren't.
What's this about, Mick?
A place where people can congregate and enjoy peace?
And that's just what you're doing?
No, Butters! You're not hosting this event, you're just ordering there online.
So just play around with the system, you fat turd!
Ziplining, dude!
You're not paying for it, you're!
Get out of here!
Mick, get away from me!
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go home!
Get away from me!
Officer Barbrady, address! Where's Cartman?
I'm trapped in here! I can't get out!
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Gooch!
He's a big guy, with a beard.
We know he's not gonna show.
You
====================
Uhhh...
Huh?
Why not?
You're such a dumbass, Cartman.
Goddamnit! There has to be a God!
God damn it!
I can't sleep at night. I feel like I'm part of a minority.
Oh, God, I can't get up.
How about this?
A night of soul searching?
No.
This is it. You've been soul searching for years.
Wow...
My God Doesn't Look At Me!
I'm in love!
Thee...terro...terrance...
I'm in love!
She doesn't even know that the world is upside down then!
Oh shit!
Damn it! Now what are we supposed to do?
I dunno.
Here we go again.
You've been here before.
Alright, here goes nothing.
Alright, here goes nothing.
Here it goes again!
Don't worry, dude. It doesn't work. You threw it away.
What is there to do?
Don't worry? It's all in good fun.
Yeah, stupid.
Don't worry, dude. I'm not doing anything illegal.
Yeah, Cartman! You're not a danger to anybody!
Free floating egg?
Nope!
Noo! What are you supposed to do?
Noo! I said, don't do this!
What's a "veal" veal?
Where's your mom?
She's not here.
Shoot!
She's missing her head.
Thirteen?
...Idiot.
What the hell are you doing?
Trying to figure out what to do, fatass.
What are you doing?
...You're always trying to trick me into doing wrong things.
I'm gonna come to your house again, I'm you.
I don't know, I didn't know you were like this.
You're looking for a gaywad to take with him on his way out.
You're looking for a gaywad to take with him on his way out.
You weren't looking out for your gaywads, you stinking gaywads are!
Oh, dude, I got it.
I got it too.
arest, I need to get the last of your veal calves back in the pasture
====================
Screw you, fatass!
I don't believe it.
How do you know that?
Mr. Garrison isn't even here.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Cartman?
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with Tammy?
Why?
Aw, come on!
How are we gonna win the contest with Tammy?
Oh, God-damnit!  God-dammit!
You guys, check this out!
It's a succubus arcanus.
Yeah.
Dude, it has a fire dragon.
Does it look like one?
Does it say "The Way of the Swiftspeeder?"
I don't know.
Well, some things just can't be known.
So how do we know?
That guy is doing it.
Look, he's a magician named David Blaine.
He walks around and tells everyone he's there for a reason.
He's the guy who put us in purgatory.
We don't have a conscience, dude. So go ahead and do whatever you want.
You'll be arrested, dude.
Thank you, magician.
What are you doing here?
Oh, thank you, the screenwriter!
Hey, let's just get our voices heard.
You writing for an magazine? That's fucking retarded!
How do we make eight hundred dollars doing that?
How much do you think you're making?
You're an asshole, Cartman!
You'll never get a $15 ticket, you fat asshole!
He doesn't even know that there's a $15 minimum wage!
That's fuckin' stupid!
They're all here.  Do you think they're gonna like our cover?
Why'd you call us?
Do you think we're gonna get a good look at them?
We don't even know for sure why they're here, but... they're...
They're just visiting the Imaginationland amusement park.
Hey, Stan.
What's going on?
...Dude, what's going on is gonna get worse?
Look, we don't even know for sure why the mall is closing.
Did you guys hear what's going on?
Cartman, there's a reason the mall is CLOSED!
Do you mind?!
Just tell
====================
They said we can't come to the wedding, you face!
Well what are you doing?
You're doing something. Trying to win money on Amazon.
It's just... trying.
It's just a bunch of bumbling turds.
Uh, I'm not doing it, Stan. I'm from Canada!
Uh, tarot, I play the game of chance.
I'm from Canada, I wanna play the game of chance.
I'm scared, Stan. There's no place like home.
I'm from Canada, Canada wants Christmas trees.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Shh, no problem! We don't even have enough money to buy the Christmas tree poles!
So where do we go?
Hey, the police?
Well, that sounds great!
You wanna go to Canada? Then you'd better have a good reason!
There's a bus in $30, but that one driver washes his hands after five trips, and gives it away.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, wait a minute. How are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Oh, hi. We were supposed to go with him to Canada's parade.
Why do we have to go there?
Dude, we'll get you to the North Pole in time for the Christmas holiday.
Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do the math?
Costumes and a bullhorn.
You're not getting on the bus, Cartman!
Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do the math yourself?!
Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do the math yourself?!
Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do the math yourself?!
Yeah, you know he's not a psychic! That's a big deal!
Yeah, yeah! How can a psychic get on the bus?!
How can they get on the bus?!
How can they get on the bus?!
Ah I told you, Cartman! You can't get on the bus!
Cartman, will you get on the bus please?!
yes. and now you can get on the bus without getting on the bus?!
YES. AND NOW YOU CAN GET ON THE BUS!
Goddammit Cartman, will you?
YES. AND NOW YOU CAN GET ON THE BUS!
Goddammit Cartman,
====================
Hi!
I'm Kyle Broflovski.
I'm Kyle Broflovski, the Star Wars: The Old Republic on TV show.
I'm Kyle Broflovski.
You're not the big fat ass, Cartman!
You're not Kenny Jack Lucas, you're Stan the Giant Kenny!
Get out of here, you fat turd!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Get out of here, you stupid piece of garbage!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Get out of here, you piece of puke-filled hellodile!
Get out of here, stupid frog!
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Why do you care?
Yeah, I hate you, but I can't stop feeling bad about who I am. This is your fault, not ours!
Get out of here, you turd!
You're not gonna kill Kenny, you dick!
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Oh, you are?
Uh, hi. We were watching the Canadian special. Uh, she wanted to see if we could train with Mr. Hankey.
Well, sorry we couldn't get them to do their special.
Can we take a shot?
To where?
Hey dude.
Yeah, sorry we couldn't get them to do their special.
How are you doin'?
Oh, yeah.
Sounds good.
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead.
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you want?!
I'm not going anywhere!
But I bet you didn't go far enough.  Cartman, we have to get you to stop. You have to stop!
Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make it just like Cartman said, we'll never get our voices heard again.
The dinosaurs came! The Earthbound freaks got together and said they want to do a movie.
Will you stop it with that?
Well, we didn't do anything to you. All that time you were trying to save the Earthbound, Buster?! Now stop!
Well, I appreciate you wanting us to be friends, but... we didn't do anything to anybody.
Stop saying "hella," American!
Surprise?
How do you say "hella"
====================
Trent Boyett is a sixth grader who was secretly Spending Christmas with his Uncle Jimbo.
Boyett's dad is a Wall-Mart, so his mom pays for all his Christmas dinner.
The strike?
Oh, Trent, sorry about that.
Totally! I'm so happy!
Oh, crap!
Trent Boyett should be punished!
Yeah, he's a great kid, but when he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he's a child he's been living for years, it's gonna be really hard to keep from crying.
Wagh.
What's the matter, Trent Boyett?
What?
Oh, dude, see?  I just got an IM from them saying that they had an IM from Cartman that said "Trent Boyett should be punished!"
That's great!  But isn't that, mind you?
You weren't really grown up, Tweek. You were raised by his family.
Well, I just want to be a teenager, not be one anymore.
Because, dude, I don't deserve to die for being different.  Except, I also don't deserve to be reminded every day that you're not Tweek Boyett.
Jesus Christ, dude.
Hey dude,
What the hell is going on?!
Dude, I know for a fact that Tweek Boyett wasn't really Tweek Boyett when he was all charged and all he did was walk around like a fat fuckin' dick sucking turd!
Oh dude, what a big, fat turd!
Jesus Christ dude, what a big, fat turd!
Who the hell are you?!
What the hell are you doing?!

You still haven't been caught, fatass!
Cartman's trying to track down the missing Tweek boys!
But what are they gonna do after that video of them playing football killed it?
Whoa, dude!
Let's just get this over with!
Ah! Give me that!
Dude, have you been drinking?
Oh no!
What?
You're so sober, fatass!
Cartman, just a minute or so before you kill yourself, I want you to give me a framed picture so that you can kill yourself!
Oh no!
I need you to keep taking that stupid breathalyzer test, Cartman!
Yeah, so
====================
Your family is...  totally  gay?!
How do you know??
Homosexual people have HIV?
What?
Oh my God!
I'm realizing that everything I've been holding back is starting to make sense.  My partner is getting HIV, and I need to find a treatment plan for it.
Some people think they're protected by birthright citizenship, but they're actually being lied to.  My partner is not getting my medication, and if I do, it's going to be really bad.
What should I do?
What should I do?
Her arms are not legs!
She's not really my little brother, Cartman! She's just a cousin!
Hold on, my brother's in here!
It's happening!
Agh!  Agghh!
Aghh!
Awesome!
But what if my cousin is on the autism team? What if my cousin is on the autism team too?!
ssss-so what if my cousin is on the autism team?
What the hell are we gonna do?!
An awards show, dude.  I don't think I'm the only one.  This is really important.
Yeah. My cousin is on the autism team.
Yeah...
Yeah, that was cool.
Whoa, dude.
Wow, I guess you're the mother internet.
Here we go again.
Admit you're Google Talkin' about autism.
Okay, here we go again.
Ike, here's the Marklar.  We need to go to the Marklar's house.
Check out the little faucet.  There's a marklar in here.
These marklars exist to make Marklar proud. They don't care about their son's education, health care, or safety.
Marklar! Marklar!
No! This is Marklar!
Ungh, gghtght, gght, I'm not speaking with you, I'm here to speak to you!
Get out of here! I'm choking you!
All right, here we go again.
This time we're going to the Marklar's house.
You see, we're from Colorado. We should probably talk about Marklar before heading back to Colorado.
Get ready, Ike. Marklar's gonna help us become good Marklar.
Get out of here
====================
I think we can finally get Mr. Hankey back in school.
Hey Mr. Hankey.  Hello?
No. He was-  Nothing.
Mookie-stinks?
Cartman, what's up?
Dude, it's Cartman.
It's okay. Mr. Hankey is going back to Cuba.
This is Cartman. He's supposed to go to Cuba with the people of Cartman, Cuba.
Well, we've got something to tell Mr. Hankey about being a good Cubaner, okay?
Hey dude?
Oh dude, you're alive.
Hey, what's that?
Anthrax?
Dude, you have nerve endings?
Wow, similarities, dude! What the hell is going on?
Dude, you're alive.
ells friends are that real?
Uuuh, yes. friends start off this way. People grow on us.
But then, they get sucked into this whole vortex of negativity.
Alright, this is really gay. Do you guys have any gaydar?
Dude, we're gonna have a problem if Stan doesn't show up to play baseball.
Okay, Stan, what do you want?
Oh, God-damnit!
Yeah. Hey Stan, what's "class?"
What's that?
Well what are you gonna do?
You're supposed to be rich! When did that start?
I'm supposed to go to the principal's house and check on you.
Yeah, that's lazy.
I'm supposed to go to the school with my family when I go to go play basketball.
Just get me to the principal's house, Cartman.
Hey, what are you going to do for Christmas?
Oh. Well, I'm going to try to get my uncle to come to Hanover.
You'll help me?
Oh my God!
Get me to the principal's house.
Yeah, that'd be faster.
You guys, I've been saving up for a new Xbox game since lunch break.
I can't believe how close I was to having my eye busted out by the FBI.
They were gonna take me to the hospital, but you made me stay here anyway.
Mr. Garrison, we'd like to speak to the principal.
I think the reason I'm not getting a Christmas present is because
====================
The Avengers are back!
It's hard to be a part of something like that.
But just like that, things have turned out alright for the Arkansas family. And the Avengers are planning their big reunion!
Hey dudes.
What are you watching?
Oh my God!
You can't believe it!
What happened?
You're supposed to be watching the Avengers again.
Because then you can't get a new one.
Get your parents to buy you another one.
Why would they do that?
This is your fault, you know it!
What happened?
Get out of here! I'm sure gonna kick your ass!
A Whedon to a T?
What did they do to her?
Get out of here?
All right, here's the other end. She's got the key to his room.
Give me that for a sec.
Okay.
You got it?
Get out of here, you piece of garbage!
ISLAND OF OLD JESUS!
This is your new fad!
Dude, there's been a big wave lately. You should know!
It's not a tsunami, it's a crested sea!
What do you mean?
This is your new fad!
Oh wait! You got it?
That's a towel!
Wow!
Oh, hey Cartman. You're finally healthy and, oh, I'm so glad I did.
I'm totally hungry.
Go Beaver or I'll throw you a monkey.
You've been here before, Kenny.
Yeah, they do!
Hold on, this place is packed. There's gotta be a cure.
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
And that's why Iactivated all my other networks.
All right, I'm gonna go to that concert. I mean, I was-
What the hell happened?
Uuuh, Jesus Christ.
He'll show.
You bastard!
Jesus Christ, there's gotta be a cure.
Alright, Cartman. You ready?
Go get his brother.
Get up, Cartman!
Get up, Cartman!
Get up, Jesus!
You bastard!
He's gonna show!
He's going to show.
He's going to show.
He's going to show.
This is gonna be sweet.  A
====================
Our parents won't let us have weapons at Raisins.
Why?
Cartman, where are you going??
WE HAVE TO GET A NEW TREND GOING!
Don't surrender, Cartman! You won't get killed!
God-damnit Cartman!
He's a magician named David Blaine who's put in a coma to make him perform miracles.
We can't.
No! We have to get past him!
NOOOO!
Nooo!
Noo! No, I won't do it!
Noo! No, I won't do it!
Noo! No, I won't do it!
No! NOO!
Noo! No, I won't do it!
No!
Oh God...
So you are, fatass!
Wow, fat. You're the fourth graders at school now.
Fatassass, you're having a nightmare.
Aaahh!  I'm having this horrible nightmare that we're at the bus stop and we're just...  awh--
Fart-thin, hunched over, wearing a button down.
...Towelie.
Whattaya want?
A ticket stub?
Whoa. Well, I have a question: Is the school getting out of town?
No, it's supposed to be here by City Airlines.
What the hell is that?
Casting?
A roadside stop, obviously.
Oh, Jesus!
...You aren't gonna die, too?
Stan?
The... girls.
Yeah. The sixth graders.
You're having a nightmare.
Will you shut up already?!
Oh, dude, check out my new Macross game!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is the best!
I'm gonna make a dummy Macross doll!
You know what I like best about you? You don't listen to Metal Gear Solid, you just play it on your cell phone.
Shh. Didn't you say your friend is on a mission?
Hey. Dude, look over there, or what?
I...I don't... have... any... strong... opinions on either of you.
You know, I think... it's pretty amazing how little of a divide the country is. Even though a lot of us are just white guys, a lot of us
====================
Corn.
It matters.
...Nuh uh.
Hohly wah.
Hohly hohly hohly hohly hohly hohly
Oh my God.
Holy shit, dude!
Yeah.
Yeah, he was so close.
Kenny had a gun, after all.
Oh! KRSBN142!
We have confirmation.
Wait!
It's too bad he isn't around.
Aah.
Aah.
Aah! Cartman's got his doubts lifted!
Yeah.
Yeah, well, maybe we can try and win some of his old TV time with us.
How come Ms. Ellen is not using video games?
Yeah.
We beat XBox one day.
What are you talking about?
Dude. You beat Wing!
Yeah. This is ridiculous.
What are we talking about are old people playing XBox video games.
He's not playing video games, fatass!
Yeah.
Let's play XBox one year.
What's the advantage?
A bunch of Tomb Raider actors.
They're thinking that fatass fat people like watching Cartman fart on a fat screen.
Wait a minute. This is how they're supposed to play video games.
What, Cartman?
I don't know. I think... we've come to expect a little too much from our elders.
Hey, are you Wendy Wing?
What the hell are you doing?!
You're doing it because you think she's popular!
You're on, dude!
Oh. Ah, I thought we were the only two women out there.
Sick, dude!
Sick, dude!
Sick, dude!
Sick, dude!
Sick, dude!
Hey! Did you hear what she's saying?
What man??
Hey! You gotta check out this new trailer for your show.
Yeah, dude!
Hey, that's a really good one.
Come on, Cartman! Let's go tell her what to say!
Yeah, she's a smartass.
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
You wanna come on a family fishing trip with me?
Uh, yeah!
Well, sorry, Mom. We were so stuck.
Come on, fatass! We have to go
====================

Yeah!
I got it! I got my brother!
It's okay, Ike. You have to have Nintendo on iTunes. All your friends have that service.
Yeah!
Yeah! You can get it anywhere!
This is amazing! But how can iTunes handle all the Shovelers? There must be a lot of new ones.
Please, though, this won't save you. You can't play with other people's friends.
What the hell is that?
Dude!
Hey, that's a great idea!
Okay, here's the other one. You guys can try iTunes for a test download.
What happens to that music?
What's known as a trojan?
What??
Kenny, can we go home now?
We know. Believe it or not, iTunes isn't even killer.
Gravy.
Yeah, but how is that gonna help us stay on as friends?
Gravy is a word that means the world identical to trojan horse.
What?
Gravy?
What?
You guys! You guys! I've been saving up for Xbox LIVE Gold. You're my new friend!
It's not stupid, it's how is it is?! Now you die for being stupid!
No, I'm saving up for Xbox LIVE Gold so that I can watch Terrance & Phillip videos on YouTube.
Woohoo!) Xbox LIVE Gold pays for video games! Video games are more important than ever!
Because that's what I wanna watch!
Oh, thank you!
Yeah! And YouTube! I can finally watch Terrance & Phillip videos on YouTube.
Uh, yeah. And Facebook! I can finally watch Terrance & Phillip videos on YouTube.
I just want Xbox Live Gold to be my friend so that when I die I wake up and think I'm just another Goth in a weird town full of weirdos.
Thanks, Xbox!
Thanks, Facebook!
Just click on the little app- I think that's what I was looking for!
You can no longer download Russian movies for me!
You're a stupid idea!
What are you downloading?
What?
That's a virus!
Okay, I'm sorry but I can't take this anymore. I've been infected with a virus that sucks ass!
Kill it, Kenny!
It's not a
====================
Hey, you're the one who brought the whale to Earth.
Well, we found it! The whale was from the water.
So we brought it to your aid, Tweek.  So you're gonna help us save the whales?
Look, guys, we don't know for sure if the new house is on the town, or if Towelie is on the left.
Maybe this is Tweek's Mom.
 Try as we might, we, we don't know where the family is.
Maybe it's Tweek's.
Maybe she's in town.
Come on, Tweek! We've gotta get her to school soon!
All right, so how do we get to Towelie?
He comes by almost every day. She's his second or third girlfriend.
I first met Tweek's when he was in grade three.
I beat him by a hair!
Wow!
I'm gutted! There's a guy here!
Hoh on  Shoreline Subways!
I beat him by a hair!
You've never heard of him?
I'm going to try and make it to school today, so I can finally get my brother back.
Please, Dieter. There's gonna be something wrong with me.
You're on, dude.
Dude! All I'm hearing is "shit" and "whitening".
Holy shit!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Jesus Christ, dude.
I've been sick!
Dude, I've been sick for days!
What the hell are we gonna do, Cartman?
Write a blog post!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Oh, we're sorry.
We're sorry.
Erm, we're just trying to get by.
Okay, we're sorry and you know?
We didn't really think it was that big a deal. Things just kind of turned out okay for her.
You're right, dude.
Oh, you're just being a stupid asshole is all she wants!
Oh yeah, I think she'll probably go to the lake.
You're just being a stupid asshole, Cartman!
She's not going with you to see the prom!
Well, because you're such a stupid asshole, you need to just stop!
Stop being a stupid asshole
====================
Uh oh. Chef?
Chef.
Chef!
Who is that dude?
Dude, are you okay?
Oh dude, we're gonna get in a car accident.
We have to get our pictures taken with the...  camera.
Can't we just download the images and put them in our apps?
But it'll do.
Sure.
Okay, thanks.
Noo! Nu-one helped us!
They saved our parents!
Yeah. They helped us!
Of course they do. It's amazing!
Yeah, and now we can buy the device that will record everything we see.
I can't believe we have to protect him.
What's this?
Dude, we're gonna get busted?
All right, here we go.
We'll get busted, dude!  Police  Police , if you keep this thing away from us, we're gonna bust your company!
We don't have a permit, bro!
This is for a company! An illegal enterprise!
A company!
They're so worried about us! We promised them safety last Friday!
Aw God!
Officer Barbrady, will you stop selling Trojan horses to terrorists?!
Well, Cartman, you're gonna have us do some field work. You need to realize that your tactics work unless and... until you start turning the tables on Muslims.
No, we're not turning the tables on Stan's good friend.
He's Stan's best friend.
Stan?
W-well, I... kind of... think this is a big deal.
Hey, did you ever... look at that guy's leg?
Aw dude, knee isn't so much the bone as the inside of his leg?
Yeah. Look at his leg.
...What?
Bad.
Stan's trying to help his dad.
How?
What's this about, Cartman?
Rebecca, we're gonna give him a ballooning ring.
Oh my God, this is awesome!
Get it, Cartman!
Get it, Rebecca!
All right, let's see the ring!
Let's just get our hands on it.
This is awesome!
Awesome!
That's awesome!
You got it, Cartman!
Yeah, I think we should get the ring.
Hey, Cartman, do you
====================
The trainee nurse is supposed to be cool and collected, but UPS had her sick?
So UPS decided to take us into their house to collect stuff?
Awesome!
Huh?
Haaaah!
Uhhhh...
W-we aren't going in!
Go on, Ike. Just go in.
Guys, we're really worried about you.  You okay?
Mr. Garrison, have you been breathing?
Oh please!
I'm so, I'm so sorry. This has been bothering me all along. Please, let me go through all of this gracefully.
I'm sorry, but I can't do this. My wife and I are going to Canada to Canada Live!
God damn it, I have to do this!
All right, I'm sorry but I can't do this. I'm too old for this.
I'm sorry, my family
I'm so sorry. This has been bothering me all along. Please, let me go through all of this gracefully.
Please, you're too old to be my wife and I'm sorry,
I don't want you to get AIDS
You're a stupid person who only wants sex with men.
Is this the right house?
Please, everything is going according to plan.  Everything's just a crazy dream.
Hello?
Hello?
What do you want?!
I'm not your boring wife!
What's "wed?"
Wweh?
Well wait, wait, that's a retarded name!
Okay, there's always gonna be name changes, Cartman.
What is a "wed" anyway?
Uh, can I just get a modified 2004 Cast Of The Governor?
I guess it's okay.
Why are they all watching us?
What's "insert gay-themed video game" all about?
Hey, that's a great idea!
Hmm... I think we can get the word away from the Catholic Church. Maybe we can criminalize same-sex intercourse.
Cool!
Is that what you mean?
Is that what you mean?
Huh?
Oh yeah.
Dude, that's a good idea.
How about we just go around and tell people you're a gaywad?
Oh no you don't, asshole!
We just stick our stupid faces in traffic and tell people what to do?
H
====================
What a stupid sport!
Dude, we're gonna win the Burger King Tournament!
Because people don't call plastic surgeon  Pops a couple of days after they come out of the lips of an asshole!
Because that's what winning is all about!
Yeah.
Uuuh, look, there's this kid who looks just like everyone else.
He's gonna get sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for trying something new every week.
Yeah. That looks pretty good.
Do you?
Whoa, dude.
Wow, Burger King is pretty good. What a wrestler!
Hey, what's up?
Oh. So what are you doing?
Uuuh, we didn't tell him that.
Hey, why don't you tell everyone?
What's that?
You're supposed to be the luckiest guy in the whole world.
All right, check this out.
We didn't even get to tell the guy.
He's gonna take us on!
You bastards!
World domination!
Whoa, dude! It's World War Z.
We're not contestants, fatass! Just me!
You're getting letters, fatass!
All right, look, th-that's a hot tub?
What's the word?
What the hell is that?
Wha, what's "hot tub?"
Whattaya think?
Wow, dude, check it out!
What do you mean?
Hoh, dude, see? See, I think maybe now that my family no longer feels safe to visit us, that's good.
I think maybe getting rid of them is the only way to end all crime.
Do you see anything?
...What?
I think he's 8 years old.
Dude, if you didn't know better, I'd say Cartman farted really hard.
Okay, what do you want?
What do you mean, "shit"?
What?
I think he's 8 years old.
Mom, Dad, what's "pubes"?
Oh. Pubes?
Hey! They're called pubes, aren't you?
Weey, we're pubes!
Yeah, but thanheeen!
What's the autochit?
Man, he's really old.
What'd he say?
Hey, come on!
====================
What's going on?
What do you want?!
Yeah, I know! I'm supposed to be watching Outlander with my family!
No, I don't!
Well, outlander, what do you want?!
What's what?
You're not supposed to be watching it with your family, are you?!
He's having us watch it with him.
Not if you say so.
So you gotta be kidding me!
What else has stupid looks?
A bunch of zombies!
And a bunch of vaginas
Because they're gross!
What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
What are they gonna say on television?
That's two and a half minutes of TV.
Go away!
Yeah, well you're just sitting there watching Outlander
Withdraw.
You'll get in trouble again and again?
Well, I'm going to Canada for a little while.
Go away!
What's Canada?
Hey, you're supposed to go to Canada with me.
She's a nice girl, isn't she?
Well, she wants to know how I can get into Canada.
You want me to meet her?
Go ahead.
Okay, so let's just GET!
So how do you go about getting Canadian citizenship?
Then you have to vote on that today!
Well... I don't know.
Well, I'm sure gonna vote for whoever I think is the prettiest.
Country Kitchen Buffet?
That's us. You can't vote for anybody else.
No! You know what? If someone else is able to vote, I'm gonna vote for you too!
No! We're not your friends! You're gonna lose your approval!
That's not knowing any better than that!
No matter what the outcome of the election, people have been messing with your mind for years!
Out!!
What are you talking about?!
Oh.  Out.  Uh.  H-uh.
A... placebo?
No, a- it's not good enough.
Yeah, it's bad enough.
Why do they have to put that in a movie.
I think we can do it. Look, we've been talking to a bunch of people now. Maybe we can get the word out that people are actually interested in getting into medicine.
No, dude
====================
I really don't care. All I care about is liking Cartman's farts.
Huh?
Hoh, geez.
I thought you didn't really get to see it, Butters.
Hoh, dude, you're such a important part of our lives, even if it takes us so long to realize it's the wrong thing.
Dude, I can't take it anymore. I've to get out of school pretty fast.
Yeah, dude.
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to make love to heaven before Jesus comes.
Phew.
Hey, uh you've been cranky. I think it might be time we got out of here.
Dude, I think we're set.
...Come, hurry.
Get out of here!
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
There's no love, there's love and loss! Oh, my God!
This is what happens when kids become adults!
Our parents have to give up trying to protect us from them.
That's what lost child murderer Michael Deets has us covered for?
Yeah, he did?
Dude, what's happened to you?
Dude, what kind of family has Michael Deets' blood?
Killer.
Hey, what's that?
Dude, what's going on?
Dude, Michael Deets was a nice guy.
Hey, die, you bastard!
Don't be stupid, dude.
What's the matter?
Ugh! Being a dumbass is not helping us feel better about ourselves!
That's not helping, dude.
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
All right, here we go.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. There's no such thing as a being as bad as Being Human.
Being is all about being who you are.
Being is about being whatever you want to be.
Being is about you.
Just like them.
Dude, I don't think this debate is fair.
You said if I share your blood with a being who makes you miserable I'm gonna end up watching a movie.
No!  You mean that Michael Deets is a being of little sense?
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Be sure to take me to the same
====================
What are you doing, Cartman?!
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
Just let it go with your practice! You're not really slowing down anybody.
You're still not giving up, fatass!
I'm already doing it. It worked.
1. Get up.
Get up. 2. Get up.
What the hell are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
No.  You're pronouncing Riley down! You're telling me that you know Riley Swoopes is a trick?!
Alright, Cartman. You're finally cool enough to play. Three-quarter did it again!
Stan?
They tried, dude. They tried playing Double Dragon on TV. We had to jump in mid-air and get our weapons on. They said they could do it.
No, they're worse than EA Sports.
They're worse. They've cut our characters. They've sold our games to under-predominant Chinese online gaming companies. They've taken our movies and TV shows and turned them into pawns in a global trade. We have to go to war.
No. You're not even close.
Get up, Cartman! you're gonna win the bet!
No! You're not a part of that, fatass!
Get up, Cartman! you're gonna win the bet!
No, I don't think so.
Yes.
Yes, I know that you do!
Yes, I'm saying this because you really should!
That's amazing!
You got that sweet tooth, Cartman? That's because of you, I think!
Oh, God.  Oh God.
I'm not a part of that, Cartman.
What?
You're lying to me.
Oh, dude, look at the question.
Which channel is which?
Here. Listen: we're gonna play L.A. Noire.
We've got to get word to people in the States who can't go to see the movie Platoon.
Who in the world are you?
Who in the world is that?
Ask her if I can come and help.
You guys are nuts!
Can weadeater!
Who is that guy?
Who is that guy?
Yeah! Ask her!
She's the woman Who Sued EA Sports For Paging and Not P
====================
South Park.
There's a bunch of stupid drawings on the wall.
What the hell are we gonna do?
There's a bunch of retarded drawings on the wall.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Just let us get Death Donuts, Cartman!
No!
Oh Jesus! Our little brother's gonna die!
We don't have time for this, asshole!
Mr. Garrison, don't you ever learn anything?!
That's stupid.
You don't understand, Cartman. You're gonna die if you don't understand.
Because you're dumb enough to look like a dumbass.
Look, I doubt us playing this game for twelve hours would make you any less of a dumbass.
What are you doing?
Dude, we're gonna have a long talk.
Hey, Cartman.
So... do you want to go to South Park this weekend?
Hey, that's a retarded idea.
Come on, we have to keep an eye on Veronica.
Don't you get it?
This is retarded.
And you won't listen to us.
So where are you going??
Well, go for it, Cartman.
Go for it, idiot!
PH!
Cartman!
Cartman!
That's retarded!
You can't hit it, Cartman!
Cartman just tries to swing by your house to see what's going on.
So we're gonna have a long talk.
Go ahead. I won't bother you.
Go ahead.
Don't be stupid, Cartman. I know what you're talking about.
South Park.
Hey, uh- we were playing around with that stupid Tweek movie trailer again this weekend.
What are we gonna say?
What are you saying?!
South Park detectives are looking for a black man they say is responsible for a string of murders.
Yeah.
Dude, we're gonna go to the lake. Come on, guys. We gotta go to the dump.
What the hell is going on?
Wwait, what are you saying?!
Dude, what are you doing?!
You found a treasure chest with the treasure?
Wow, look at those eyes!
What am I supposed to do with him?
Dude, there's a big guy with a big face on camera!
Stan?

====================
Hey Cartman!
I'm just a kid without a mom.
Mom! I'm okay!
Well, there you go.
Dad?
You'd better be. Cartman is the toughest teacher in the world.
Stan?
Dow...
Stan?
Cartman, what's happened?
No, Dad, it's just not right.
All right, I'm sorry, but I can't do anything.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm here to see if you can come to an end.
Don't worry, Dad. I'm gonna see you in a couple of days.
Come on, come on, I'll tell you all about what happened to me.
Dude, you don't know what to do with me!
Huh?
I'm so confused.
Wendy, you can't miss the fight.
Who is Beatriz?
How can she miss the fight?
Yeah, everything is flashing white.
How come she's not breathing?
How can she know that?
Oh wait. Wait, I forgot something.
Dude, you're right. Beatriz's been breathing for a while.
She's not breathing for a while.
Surely she's not, that's for sure.
She's not really behind me now?
Why, Beatriz?
Who's Beatriz?
Suddenly, Cartman is suddenly alone.
He kicks again.
Oh, dude, calm down.
Oh dude.  D-I-I don't know what to do. This is crazy.
I don't know what to do.
Just let it go, dude. You're gone.
Oh no. Cartman is no longer alone.
Get out of here.
Get medical help.
That's better.
What's the matter with him?
Get up?
How is that gonna help?
Yeah, dude. Somebody's been messing with our brains.
Dude, take off your headset. Monsters are coming!
Hey, you're seeing stuff from a computer.
You know, from a supernatural source.
I'm hearing that some of these buildings are real.
There have been enough disturbances to make the City of Diamond and Pearl casinos collapse.
You must have a lot of money, Cartman. They could collapse into the lot.
I heard that, too
====================
You may have heard that Chef is going to have his intestines ripped out during the episode "Cartman's Wedding."
No, dude, the camera man observed the wedding party and took the decision to cancel it.
Chef, the line at the mall is getting shorter by the minute! Get the episode!
Tell them to get the episode pulled so we can get the episode pulled again!
All right, let's do this. We've got 13 minutes.
What's the matter with him?
(Sick!)
Hang on, Cartman!
Go help him!
(Sick!)
Stan, dude!
What is going on?
(Sick!)Nuh uh!
(Sick!)Is there something we need to patch it out of my brain?
Well, let's just say "shit" over and over again.
I'm not putting up a picture of you guys holding hands at all.
Hoh, geez.
Dude, he's shaking.
All right, let's just say "shit" over and over again.
"shit" is a stupid word. "shit" is not dirt.  It's just fattening up.
Dude, I don't understand your attitude on this.
Stop it, Cartman!
I think you're pretty dangerous in there.
Dude, there's a missing person report coming.
All right, let's just say "shit"!
So, 'cause somebody's missing, called the police.
So, "shit" is not a new thing.
Dude, there's a missing person report coming.
All right, let's just say "shit"!
So, "shit" is not a new thing.
Oh my God! It's just yesterday. It's just that there's a new kid in town.
It's not like I can tell you what "shit" is.
Dude, you have to tell everyone.
All right, let's just say "shit".
So, "shit".
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Cartman. I've been in the hospital already. They gave me a blood transfusion.
Goddammit, Cartman! You only have so much blood, and you invent all kinds of crazy stuff!
No, dude, you don't exist to tell the truth. You
====================
Oh boy.
What the hell?
Mr. Hankey!
It was him.
Mr. Hankey, what the hell?
Don't worry, dude. You're gonna get busted again later on.
Dude, we're gonna get busted again.
Dude, we need to talk to you!
All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
You want me to forget it all, okay?
No, dude, it's just, it's so sad.
All right,  look, if you knew we were gonna kill you, what were we gonna do?
Go for it, Ike.
Mom, Dad!
They landed on Cartman, and Cartman was left with only a turd.
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
Dude, why'd you make those drawings?
Oh Jesus, you're right, Detective.
Oh God, I have to tell the truth.
No, ah I was playing Detective, you know? I was eating some pork rinds, and I was about to jump over a train.
You bastard!
Jesus Christ!
Hold on, Detective! I'm alive, buddy!
Awwgh!
I know you didn't, but you didn't shoot him.
You bastard!
He's dead?
I'm dead?
You bastards!
He's your fault, too!
Yeah!
Yeah, you're a stupid asshole, Cartman!
Yeah, you're a stupid asshole, Cartman!
Stan, how come the Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't playing Detective anymore?

I don't know, I don't know.
Dude, for the last time, you shouldn't tour with us. We've been bused by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Sure we'll help you look for them
Dude, this is where we can hide us
Don't worry, you guys. Our friend was found and we got sent to jail
Hold on, this is for Detective.
Look!  See Jimmy, he's got something else on him.
D-Jimmy, you found a missing person report.
That's my friend!
D-ey, he's in the water!
He's my little brother!
You bastards!
He told us to avoid the lake!
Yeah. Then
====================
How much do you wanna bet?!
Okay, you're gonna have your first taste of life when we go over to eat at Cartman's house.
Dude, your family died.
How much do you wanna bet?!
Okay, Cartman, you're gonna have your first taste of life!
Okay, let's see how many people can get us sick.
Okay, let's see how many glasses we can get our powers into!
How much do you wanna bet we can turn into vampires?
How much do you wanna bet we can turn into Banshees?!
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
Yyeah, i k.
Got what?
They turned Kenny into a Banshees
Wha... what?
What?
A mouth to live?
Why are they doing that to us?
..What the hell?
Can we please just get through here?
No, we can't. It was too long.
We can?
What the hell are you doing with your fucking hands?
Kenny's a hostage?
You want me to just get through here?
No, dude, it's not like this will bother you. At all.
Please. Please, just leave me alone.
- Hang on, dude.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Aagh!
Hey dude, people around here are dying. You gotta help us, but your friend here is a hostage.
Goddammit, Cartman! You've gotta help us or we'll die!
He's a kid from South Park. He's a killer!
Then why is his name so important?
Call out the powers?
Sup, sir!
Butlers! Things are about to go crazy!
Barking vaginal belch.
Bloody butt cough.
What are we supposed to do?
What is this?
What's wrong with our species?
And, and'?
How do we know it doesn't belong in the brig?
Yeah. I'm ba-bellied.
What's the matter?
Yeah, dude. Your mom's a big bitch to deal with.
I know. I'mbellied.
We're not kids. We're people. We have a species problem.
What'sn't you got to do with
====================
Campus? What's the word for that?
Is that a word for "bitch"?
Yeah, I bet they do.
Shh, no problem, Cartman. You use that as a defense.
You bastard!
We're the good word!
Dude, that does it! Ever since that sixth grader at the school is having a hard time adjusting to society, we're gonna be the ones dealing with the problem!
Look, that should do it. There's no choice anymore, dude. You become the bad boy out of a, bastard!
Look, that should do it. Maybe this is the best time to change names.
Huh, what the hell is that?
Oh, whatever.
Uh oh, we're losing him.
Hey, that might be the best time to name him.
Hey, yeah! I think so.
Hey, yeah! Let's go over to the bus stop.
What's "pubes"?
Oh, geez.
Okay, so now that we know what "pubes" are, what do we do for news of?
Well, we found this guy. He's a wuss.
We found this wuss last week. We went to his house and got some more...  semen.
We had sex with his wife!
Really?
Well, I've been thinking, how did this happen?
Well, the author of the story is a serial killer.
The serial killer.
And that's why we have to kill him.
How did this happen?
When you're my age, I have no idea.
You're wrong, this is wrong
I'm so confused I almost thinks about it
So, just be careful dude. This is all getting old.
You're a murderer.
Yeah, I know that.
Eh now, shut up about being a wuss and get some practice
Good for you, you fatass!
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
Gentlemen, we are off!
The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the
====================
What is this?
A bunch of pork rinds!
Yeah.
See, we got you to Stan's house.  And that's why Cartman is goin' to kill us.
Why?!
See?  This is supposed to be my new friend.
Yeah. This is my friend No.  See, now No. 19? This is my new friend.
O-urgina means "off-licansion."
Oh my God!
No gee, No more time out No more time out!
No more time out, No more time out!
No more time out, No more time out!
No more time out, No more time out!
Time is money.
Dude, I don't think we're gonna get out of school. I think we might get stoned all night.
Dude, have you ever heard of "revenge porn"?
I thought my mom was gonna take me to the police.
Hey, have you ever had your dad taped to you?
HePromisedMeI'd get out of schoolRight now.MeTooUntilWeGet-Tasered.See, we've been through this already. It seems like everything is going according to plan. A few high schoolers are having sex with students at school. 
Girls are getting sick? Really? What happens?
All right, come on guys.
Dude, if these girls are getting sick, then he's not taking care of her. He's just taking-
Come on, Stan, you've got to help her!
How come these cars are so rare?
Girls don't have Aspergers Syndrome?
Why Are They Not Getting Hybrid Cars?
So what are the possible causes?
Dude, I know hybrid cars are cool, but is it really gonna help the hybrid cars?
I'm not driving a hybrid car.
.@solarisandbits I don't think a lot of people with Aspergers Syndrome can drive an electric car.
.@solarisandbits, but you can still get sickle hellion.
So what?
Dude, I'm just a kid.
I Can't Doououvre! My parents have me!
Please, you're my family!
Dude, I Can't Stop Blinking!
Is It Christmas?
Oh my God,
====================
It's not really a conspiracy, it's just that I think it's important that we learn more about what's going on.
Look, I totally understand that you feel like you're being blamed, but I... I just think it's really important that we all learn to deal with our emotions honestly. And, and not rely on one game as a scapegoat.
I think we're finally going far enough. I'm thinkin' to 'Til It Growls.
I'm thinkin' to 'Til It Growls.
Hey, uh...
I'm kind of pushy-feely around here, but I find that really useful. You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit black people's disease while still making a serious impact on the entertainment industry.
I'm just not sure this is the direction this country should take.
I don't think we're going in the right direction.
I think it's time we took a hard stance and said we're not going in the wrong direction.
I think we can win this battle, Stan.
I think we can hold on to our original vision of what a responsible entertainment industry would look like.
And, and embrace the opportunities presented by cable news.
And help push the boundaries of what's acceptable.
No matter what fight or controversy we enter, we will always have a place in the entertainment industry.
Dude, don't you see that it's not?
That's amazing.
Check it out:
Hey, look!
We're trying to get a deal for Stan's Casa Bonita party. You're the minority shareholder.
Dude, if you don't get a place to stay in the Black Sea town eight hours away, I'm gonna kill you!
What are you doing?
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you places either.
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, watching my stupid cat walk around on a stick!
Hey, that's a great idea!
Hmm... I've heard that, too.
Elder, There's something you need to tell my dad.
That bastard!
I'm so confused.
I don't know what to do. I just have this sudden urge to tell my dad about what's going on.
But Elder Taylor, I think my dad might be feeling a little weird.

Will you stop it?
That's your cell?
All right, let's see.  What's the matter?
Now, that's all I know!
What do you guys wanna talk about?
Dude, you're gonna get better?
Stan?
Code 7!  Stan?
Stan!
What's the matter, dude?
Oh. We're not going anywhere.
Why do you need me, Stan?
Code 7!
Stan?
Code 7! Hey, look, we're trying to get a digital copy of David Blaine.
Yeah. He talked to your parents.
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Did you guys figure out how to make David Blaine look like this?
And you know how that sixth graders look like? We've gotta imitate their looks, right?
Get David Blaine on the football field!
And then you'll help us teach the football team how to play the football.

To Barnaby, the penguin!
To school mascot!
You penguins!
He's a tough nut to crack, Butters! But we know how to make him stand out.
We've got work to do, dude, just get us by the penguins!
Dude, we've got to get by this craziness for a long, long time.
We're not going anywhere until we get a lot of attention.
Come on, Stan. We've gotta get past the penguins before they leave.
I know your mom and dad are pissed, but still... we're serious students.
We're gonna play hockey, dude.
I know who. I think it's gonna be okay.
Hey, who's that?
Dude, our mom.
You sure you aren't Kenny.
Who are you?
What do
====================
What's going on?
I can't believe it!
All this for a little girl's sake, aren't you? Don't you understand that sometimes, being a girl is always worth it? Look around you, you asshole! You don't even know what life is like without a girl.
Well, I was talking to her about all the ridiculous things she's gotten into trying to get noticed, and she was totally hooked!
Look, that's it. That's all I have left. I'm out of options.
I have an old picture of her putting up posters around town. It's just one of those stupid projects. Maybe she's just really into it.
I'm not going anywhere!
No, dude, there's a guy who can get ahold of her and, and then we can wrestle.
God, do these things again!
Holy shit, dude!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, now we're gonna WCW!
What does that have to do with wrestling?
Alright, what does it do?
Okay, then let's see how he likes it.
Okay, then let's see what he thinks of our match.
Kenny Desjardins is not a good wrestler.
Okay, you're right.
What?
What match?
Okay, you're wrong.
Can we please see your dressing room?
And then we can wrestle?
Yup, he's supposed to be in here.
What the hell?
Shhh, you're lying!
You want me to throw the towel around, Stan?
Hold on, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
Come on, Stan, we have to get back to the ring!
What the hell is wrong with you, Stan?
The count is being called off, dude.
All right, I'm going to the bathroom. I need to get a new one for my baby.
I'm sorry, Stan.
Dude, getting a new one is a whole other story.
Oh Jesus Christ!
Oh, sorry.
I got a new one, Stan.
I'm sorry, I can't take it.
I need you to keep watch over there. My little brother and I are... going to go to the mall to buy Afghani muffins.
What the hell is wrong with us? Mom? Dad?
I thought you
====================
Our friend has been missing for a few days. So we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Kyle.
I don't care if he's awake or not.
Guys, open this case to the full brain!
You aren't going to kill us.
Dude, something's wrong with Cartman.
Did you eat too many grits?
What?
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
I can't. I have to get my brother and Dad out of here.
Hey, you know who those people are.
Don't you just?
Got you to a hospital right away.
Yeah, I think so.
What?
What?!!
I'm not sane, my parents know that!
All right, now!
No, you're not!
Go away!
Yeah, this is your fault. You just didn't come to me about it.
Yeah! You got rid of the part about Count Dookil and it getting made into a movie!
What the hell is that?!
It isn't a movie. It's a fake!
It's a fake!
I'm gonna kill you!
Everyone thinks you're a fag!
Awww!
Awwgh!
You killed him, Cartman! He's a fag!
Go away, you filthy son of a bitch!
Yeah. It was easy.
Just tell everyone you made out of Meredith Baxter's vagina.
Will you please shut up about raping women?
Oh my God!
Don't kill me, Cartman! That thing is huge!
How many pounds of my fat, fragile womb do you have?
Y-you'll believe it!
He didn't succeed!
That thing that landed on Cartman was a fag!
Don't you just can't deal with what you're going through? The media is all gyrating about the bookish power of your lesbian friend.
I've been doing this for years.
You sit in the front row and read until the panel on hate speech is up.
Then you get all gagged.
Okay, come back to me as soon as possible.
All right!  You're going to read the entire panel on hate speech here!
But it's just one panel. You can disagree on all
====================
At what point do you stop being an asshole and start liking each other again?! I'll never forget the first time we got together!
Uh, I think maybe this is the best reunion ever!
Oh my God! I'm so happy!
Oh, God-dammit!
Oh, no...
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
Thanks.
Goddammit, Cartman!
Are you sure you wanna go?
Go ahead.
She's here!
Goddammit, Cartman! I brought her!
What should we do now?
I... what?
No, go away!
She's not here!
Get up! You can't be here any longer!
All right, fine! I'll go.
What's this about, Cartman?
A meeting between scientists and engineers?
Well, I was trying to steal his mind-control device!
There's no need, fatass! Just get out of here!
Get out of here! I'm choking you!
That's a fake, Cartman!
What the hell is this?!
Seriously, dudes! You have to look at this!
Dude, this is serious! You have to look at this closely!
afety!
We have to go to the hospital!
The government has to look into this!
Who's the principal?
Look, we don't have a lot of time, dude.
Dude, you're gonna need help. Just, just go ahead and do this.
Just take me home.  Tell my parents I'll never be able to help them again!
What's this all about, Cartman?
A meeting between scientists and engineers?
Damn it!
You know what scientist Dr. Bailant actually is?
Dr. Bailant is a brilliant man with a big fat scooter.
I think I can show him all the experiments I've been given so far.
But he can't do anything.
No!  No, he's on a suicide watch?
Well, we can't keep him on the watch.
I think he's little Marco and Stan.
They're not dangerous.
No more tests.
You go!
He's dead.
You'll never get a digital watch attached to it, Cartman!
That's not very sturdy
====================
Corey Lanskin
Corey Lanskin, the new kid in school, huh?
Look, he's doing a great job as Mr. Garrison, but he's still just starting his acting course.
Garrison is a big, fat, fat-shy asshole who hates teachers, liars, and other self-centered people.
Garrison, what the hell are you doing?!
Gah!
Oh man! I don't know what to do. I'm scared!
Get up!
Get up!
Oh my God! That was the biggest mistake you made!
God damn you!
Whoa!
That's a big night!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Whoa, dude!
Do you think we're gonna get Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare 3?
Or something?
Tomorrow's World Cup?
Well, I've been preparing myself for this for a while now. I think that, in the long run, this game will be more important than ever.
What do you mean?
I'm ready?
I can't even get up.
I know who.
This is serious.
Dude, you've gotta be kidding me!
Oh dude, I don't know what to do. I just can't get up.
Man, it's crazy.
Wow!
Oh, dude, check it out! I can play here  any time of the day.
Yeah, they have a life app, Timmy's House. You can buy it, and get a bunch of other virtual reality titles.
Dude, I can't be here any longer! I peed in your ass!
I'm out.
Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
Because that's what this is about, Stan! I'm a part of this forever friendship!
I wanna be a part of this forever friendship too!
You bastard!
Because dude, you're not gonna make it into the Terrance & Phillip movies. They died when they did that commercial for McDonald's.
You're on, Cartman!
Hey Stan, don't be such a baby! I'm sure we can get through this together!
Look, this is all getting way too big. Let's do this. 1) Let's say the Terrance & Phillip commercial has since been taken down; and 2) Let's say the movie is getting
====================
Ex-girlfriend?
Well, I'm a Vulcan. I was born a Vulcan.
I'm a Vulcan.
Yeah. You hear that?
Kenny!
Whoa!
Aagh! Stop that!
Kenny! Stop pronouncing 'veal' like that!
Oh no...
You can't be the best knight in South Park.
Aagh! Patrol my uterus!
Yeah, I bet she does.
I can't be the best knight in South Park.
What?
Aagh! I'm gonna be sleepy for a minute.
Dude. Buck up!  Oh, the school bus is going fast!
Ah!
What?
Aagh! I'm supposed to go to Kyle's with my parents tomorrow and see if they let me in.
I'm supposed to go to Kyle's with my parents tomorrow so I can prove I'm a good knight in South Park.
I can't. My parents told me that!
All right, mister! You gotta calm down! I'm gonna give him the long-awaited report on me!
It's a surprise. An honorary one.
No, he's sure. A treasured one because he's South Park's least favorite kid.
What's yours, Ike?
He didn't say long ago he was going to be a knight in South Park.
You bastard!
He's going to be a knight in South Park if he doesn't change Garfield's name!
What do you mean?
That's not cool!
Doesn't matter anymore! This is all just a marketing ploy by the South to get people to give the South their attention.
Look, it's just another day at the office. This is all getting way too big.
Dude, this is probably the best day of the year! Look at all these people commenting on things!
Aren't they hungry?
Oh, cool.
How about this cake?
Whoa, dude.
I'm saying what I know things should be like.
A princess and a turd sandwich.
What the hell are you doing?
That's two against one, fatass.
You want Prince Harry to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Cartman's not gonna win the Peace Prize!
This is how kids do it on television!
Aaa
====================
Corey Lanskin?
Hey Kenny.
What's going on?
Dude, just ask her for an explanation.
Hey, did you guys hear what's going on?
Peter Pan is not real!
God-dammit!
Will you shut up already?!
linspans!
No ones listening to me!
Is it you guys?
They're just wandering around like nothing's changed?
I know they're pretty scared, but just ask them for a reason!
I made a movie. Please trystan.
Yeah, they're scared.
Come on, Stan. We gotta go tell people about their friend Stan.
That guy is w-walking around scared in the middle of the night.
Who is this guy?
Hey, uh- our friend Stan's been... missing.
We found him last week, by chance. We were out driving on country road 234.
It's the best part. Everyone is wearing ankle-high sandals. Stan doesn't even know who he is.
Uh, hi, we're trying to find our friend Stan.
Wow, awesome!
Ugh, awesome.
Watch out!
That's our friend, dude. Watch out!
Wha- what?
Shit!
What's this?
What's this?
Dude, this is a sex-change operation.
hmm...
Will you please shut up about something important already?
That's retarded!
Oh my God!
I can't believe it!
This is so wrong.
Just stop it! This is taking forever.
Just stop it! This operation is for saving Stan.
That's right!  Oh God, it's so wrong. I feel so rejected.
I feel like a pansy.
You want people to believe you didn't change your mind.
Just stop it Stan!
Woohoo!
He's right, but we people need to keep looking for him. Without him things would be the same as they are right now.
Stan!
Look, guys, we're gonna have our best episode as soon as possible.
Check it out:
He changed his mind?
What do you mean?
No, but it's okay. Guys should know that you're not the guy they think they are.
This is gonna be awesome!
We've got work to do,
====================
Hey, look!  It's a flavor textured with polyvinyl chloride.
I'm pitch black.
Oh, dude, I made it all down by this point.
Uh, what's the matter with him?
Hey, yeah! What the hell are you doing?!
Hey, you turdpants!
Sick, dude!
Hey, we're having these stupid parties here at the mall.
Cartman, I feel bad for having to sneak in through the back door!
Bad.
Jesus Christ, dude!
Oh, dude, I gotta go.
I know. I've been here before, and I can't find the cop tape.
Let's do this.  We'll get the videotape,  so we can prove we're the real deal.
Dude, it's a big deal. If the cops can get the tape, we can win a million dollars.
Damnit!
Let's do this. We'll get the videotape, turdpants!
Damnit!
We're not cops. We're fat turdpants!
Okay.  We've got to get the tape to a couple of cities; we've got to get the furtive people to go with us.
City:  Black Friday

:  Best of both worlds? We get to keep our hats and shovels. We get arrested and hadsled by the feds.
Well, it's a black Friday with Amazon. We have a lot of stuff to buy, asshole.
What are you doing here?
Oh. Dude, you want me to just forget it all, so I can be home before Christmas.
Hey. Maybe you should come clean and tell everyone already. That your husband and his turd-toothed brother were somehow responsible for 9-11.
Oh, you're not lying to people. They'll believe you.
So. This is how you keep the economy from imploding.
Oh. And I've got some more news:)
Hillary Clinton's campaign is spending all of its money on TV ads that say "couple old people want a kid," instead of actually having one, campaign spokesman John Podesta said.
Podesta, you have to tell the truth!
Yeah, but he's a dumber and a poorer man.
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we didn't think of.
====================
What's going on?
I don't know. I think... it's kind of gay.
How do you define "gay?"
What?
Shhh. No, I'm serious. I wanna be clear. I think... it's okay to define your own sexuality.  I'm not saying gay people have to be away from my family, I'm just saying that I think being a full-fledged lesbian or gay person is a spectrum.
You gaybutt! That's awesome!
Cool!
Oh, God!
No, God, I gotta go to Ike's. I can't miss it.
I can't!
I'm being totally serious! I know there's people out there who might find it offensive, but just like me, you might?
Dude, come on.
No, dude, there's a guy who might find it offensive.
Maybe he's on to something.
Definition?
Oh my God, yes. I think that's great.
Okay, then let's see how he likes the outdoors!  And then I think, "Oh, I know how to handle a shotgun," so I can just throw it away!
Okay, then let's see how he likes fishing!
Okay, then let's put the boat back in the lake!
Okay, so how would you like to see South Park season one overseen by Mr. West?
A boat ride?
Aboard the Tullamoreski?
Would you please let Mr. West use the television room at South Park Elementary School, on Friday?
We need everyone's help, dude.
We're trying to get the South Park Elementary kid who was drugged and drugged into not-South Park.
Mr. West?
South Park isn't South Park! South Park is animated and connected to the Internet!
South Park isn't South Park!
You're not putting the Tullamoreski in the TV room, Mr. West! It's Mr. West!
South Park isn't South Park!
Well put, West!
South Park isn't the outdoors! South Park is just... a crazy place.
Yeah. But where did you find Honey Boo Boo?
South Park.
The outdoors? That's so stupid.
Yeah, they're all over the Internet.
What do you mean?
Here's the thing, guys. Don't be
====================
Hey, you doing this to a child?
I thought I was playing a child molester.
...Oh, Jesus!!
Do you really think this is cool?
Four to go?
Cartman, what's happened to you?
Dude, your mommy and daddy are going to hell.
What??
Well, Cartman, I was just trying to play a child molester.
Dude, if my mom knew me, she would be hysterical.
How can she be? All I knew was that she was trying to help her dad, a murderer.
What's this about, Cartman?
That's retarded.
You've got Oprah on your iPad?
How can she be? All I knew was that she was trying to help her dad, a murderer.
How can she be? All I knew was that she was trying to...  breathe.
Hey, Pip, can I talk to you?
Pip, don't you ever let anybody get in your way? That wasn't even close.
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to your dad, Pip.
Hoh, hi, can I talk to you?
Pip, my name is-
Hi. Is Pip okay?
Pip?
I'm sorry, but I couldn't get in to your dad's funeral. You had to talk to him.
Pip?  You're just saying that because you think his ashes are important helps us make sense of what's happened.
That's what I wanted to hear from you all along.
So how are things going at Bebe's Pond?
Dad, you can't get in?
Why the hell would you want that on your own?
Yeah!
No, Dad, it's like—beyond belief.
Yes!
Yes it is!
Yes it is!
I'm not a rational being.
Yes, I do!
Yes I am!
This is what I believe in as a Jew.  Faith is not a choice, it's a basic Jewish tenet.
No! I'm not getting in any trouble now!
I'm not getting in any trouble at all!
Thanks, Jew!
Get back to the kitchen!
Yeah, it was good watching this guy get his hand bitten by a pig.
Dude, he's not even my best friend.
What
====================
What's going on?
I don't know. They said if we all agreed to a five-year deal, they wouldn't have to search for the whale.
Aw come on guys, we can still get an awesome movie!
We have to talk to the people who own the whale!
Get the Jews out of here!
How can they know we own the ship?!
That's not being nice!
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to the deal.
That's not being nice!
I'm sure we're gonna get word the next day that everyone's purring!
That's not being nice!
Oh, Jesus!!
Do we?!  Do we have any friends?
Get him!
Yeah, he's my new pet elephant.
Well elephant husband!
You're not having friends from now on 'cause my mom won't let me have a friend calf.
Hey elephant husbander!
Dude, look!
I'm not going anywhere!
Oh dude, what the hell is that?
Dude! You've got to check this out!
I can't even get ice cream here. It freezes to the touch!
Do you know what's goin' on?
All right, come on guys.
Dude, we're almost to the hospital.
Holy shit, dude!
What has this nurse seen??
Oh my God. That's two sheets of paper!
Gross!
Dude, this hospital has become a dumping ground for infectious disease.
I'm gonna get a C!
Dude, this is like a third-world country. Caravans are awesome!
South Park.
Oh my God, that's great!
Oh, God, that's great!
We're doin' alright.
Will you make it to the hospital right away?
All right, will you make me a seat?
What are you doing?
Will you make me a seat?
Okay, will you make me a seat?
Will you make me a seat please?
Okay, good.
All right, all right.  My parents know. I was born in a dream. An elephant smacks a baby on the mouth and makes them say "shit" again.
Fucking shit!
NOOOO!
Oh God! Oh shit!
Oh, no!
====================
Wuh what are we gonna do??
He's just a crazy old dude with a bunch of new powers.
Shh. Shut up.
Yeah, he's some kind of jokeuuaturgh.
Hey, is he in there?
Hey, what's "empathy"?
Well, that's a little... off.
Yeah, that's science-fiction.
Power
Yep.
What kind of powers?
Huh?
Meech.  Aw, aw, I can't take it.
I'm not psychic. I'm always psychic.
I'm not psychic, you asshole!
You use psychic abilities only when called upon to do so, not when you're supposed to!
You don't get to strike anything!
All powers! All powers!
This is calledanasia!
Goddamnit!
GHG!
Oh dude, I do!
Please, I need to talk to this guy.
I think he's gonna give me a A, asshole!
GHG!
Jesus Christ!
Oh, dude, check it out!
I think he's gonna give me a B, asshole!
Oh, dude, I can't take it! I'm gonna smash it up with a ga- gun!
Awwgh!
Yeah, I'm nine.
(I need you to keep playing this stupid video game.)
You know what, Cartman? I think you might be able to save my little brother.
You're on.
See? I told you, dude. Daddy's not here.
Yeah. It's a big sodium bicarbonate cavern.
There, he's gonna have to give it to us.
Yeah, this is awesome.
Dude, this is the part I was talking about.
Dude, if you don't tell us, I'm gonna kill you.
Yeah!  Haaa!
How do we get him?
A wooden spoon.
A wooden spoon with a wooden handle.
A wooden spoon with a wooden handle.
Go, dude.
Get the other kids in the class into a circle and get ready to go hunting.
When all the drama has passed, will you go?
You're not gonna win that costume contest, Cartman?!
No, no, Cartman!
Go help her, dude.
She's not my little brother
====================
Well that was cool!
Heidi Turner didn't want to do that.
Well, she didn't want to do that.
Did you?
What?
No, Ike? Aren't you a little young for this?
Mom, Ike, don't hurt anybody. They're my little brother and they protect me from wrong.
God-dammit!
They molestered us. They molestered me!
No, Mom, they leered at me.
W-what are you doing?
W-w-what are you doing?
W-what are you doing?
I'm not doing, you're doing?
What??
I'm not doing anything, I'm just reading, watching porn, or doing other things.
Shh. Shut up.
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
I know you don't think this is funny, butttle,' Cartman! I'm not going anywhere without you!
No dude, you're on.
They leered at me. "You know he can do whatever he wants because of his mom's lecherous genes?"
I told you I knew what to do!
What's cloned?
AAAAAA!
Hey there dude. What is that?
Oh. Well, I was just trying to warn you, not screw him over.
What the hell is that?
TP?
Oh. I just found out that you're not my little brother.
Well I'm not going to help TP anymore, I'm just going to give him up for something.
I can't keep him from killing himself.
Oh TP, I just found out that you're not my brother anymore.
Oh, okay.
You bastard!
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
Dude, that could literally anywhere!
Wow, third grade!
Really? What's that about?
You on Earth?!
TP, what are you doing?
Wow, second grade! Your teacher is a murderer!
Wow, third grade! You got dumped out by couples you hate, TP.
What the hell is going on?
I'm not a douche, dude. Not at all what you intended.
Okay so, what are you doing?
I'm not a doctor, dude
====================
I really need some help identifying a malevolent being.
I've got confirmation that the Goonies are the real deal.
Goonies! Goonies!
I'm sailing ay on a balloon.
It's a Goonies!
Wow!
I'm doing it really well. Mr. Hankey has his eye on every balloon.
But Mr. Hankey, he doesn't know about this balloon ride.
Mr. Hankey, go home!
No, Mr. Hankey, go home!
All right, I've had just about enough! The Goonies are the real deal!
Goonies! The adults!
Yes, they are!
One please.
Yeah, real people do such a thing.
Gross!
Oh dude, dude, this is heaven!
Dude, this is our new house!
And it has miniature domas!
Agh!
Oh dude, we aren't even friends anymore.
Dude, we're gonna end up... going off the reservation.
I don't know.
Oh cool.
SNL is awesome. You can watch it here.
Okay, Mr. Hankey!
You're gonna get a big part in the next one.
Yeah, I think so.
What?
What's ahh...
Yeah, heh, heh.
Eh-heh, heh.
Eh-heh, heh.
Dude, he's supposed to be here.
Me too.
Yeah, I've been saying for days that I want this show to be about parents and hard-Boars.
But everyone just start fights. Let's start our own family tv show.
Yeah, all you have to do is split up and have your family TV-homed for a while, and then go home.
Chef, do you have any ideas?
A family?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU!
Dude, that's terrible!
I'm so confused.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU!
You bastards.
I don't know.
Why are they doing this to us?
Stan?
Why?
I'm so confused.
I love Family Guy. I love the idea of parents getting a little too powerful, and being mean to their kids.
Yeah. This is exactly what I've wanted
====================
YES!
It's great to have you back, Chef!
And you too!
Oh, sooo much for just one night!
Agh!  Agghh!
Yeah. I feel like a meerkat.
Hello,?
What are you doing here?!
Hello?!
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, hoards of guys just waiting for me to kill them. They're from Somalia. Somalia. And they all look like meerkats. 
You get in trouble for being a fag, don't ya?
Okay, Cartman, I'm going to tell you all about this fag named Mohammad.
I don't care if I am a meerkat!
All that time I watched my mom suck a baby elephant,ugh!
I'm going to give that fat turd a jail-time card, so I can later replay the accident.
Totally! I don't care!
You are not getting away with this again, Cartman!
I'm going to the kitchen! This is terrible!
Totally, dude!
Totally! 
We have to get this over with! This can't be right now!
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right!
Dude, we've just been through the whole thing with my parents. They've forgiven me, and I'm thankful.
God-damnit Cartman!
They did?
Who cares? They really did forgive us, Stan. I just have to let them go.
Okay. Let's just go.
Not you, Cartman. You're forgiven me.
Yeah, I'm feeling better.
Go away, you crazy man.
What's this place?
This is nuts.
You want me to run after you, Cartman!
Hey, come on! Stop! Somebody's following you!
All right, this place is ruinous.
All right, there's the E.T. guy.
You know he might be. Come on, dude, we're playing cards.
Hey, are you going to come help us when we're all clean?
How can we make a stupid joke?
Oh, dude, check this out.  We've got some cigarettes we're gonna smoke with Kenny.
Yeah, this is really gay.
Hey,
====================
Hey Cartman,
I'm sorry, but this has gone far enough. You've been a long-time friend, Cartman. You know how sometimes with Age of Apocalypse stuff happens.
Maybe we're luck to side with a stupid elephant!
Aah!  Oh, thanks.
God damnit!
Oh, like you know what'll work?
We'll do what's right.
No, dude, we're not going with them.
Alright, they're totally against it.
Which one is more Antichrist?
You're such a fat bastard, Cartman!
Yeah, they killed all antichrists!
No, dude, that's Antichrist.
What's a "shitfire"?
Definition?
Dude, that's such a lame idea.
Oh, whatever.
Definition?
Dude, you have to define something.
What?
What's "shit"?
Definition.

shitwww.
shit is not a word!
Awww, that's a retarded idea!
No, it's "shit", it's a stupid word!
All right, "shit", I thought it said "shit"
What the hell is that?
shit?
Nuh-uh!
Uuu-uh!
Ooooh and a uhh, a no-gi!
Cue a nuh uh!
Eh now, cue up!
Eh now, cue up!
Eee, now that I think about it, mr. Brady is a real person!
A real person? That's Brady Anderson.
What's a "shitfire" anyway?
Oh my God! What a dick!
Coup de grah, Cartman!
Oh thanks, you got me!
Now that I think about it, Cartman is the biggest asshole
====================
by
The Declaration of Independence?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
What the hell are you doing?!
What are you doing?!
You're... doing something?
What is it?
Ike? Iiike!  Ike, you're back!  Ike, you're gonna be seeing people from around the world over lunch break!
Ike?  Iike!
Hoh, Ike, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
How come there aren't more Sexy Action School Club singles?
What the hell are you doing?!
Hey! Hey, check out this new trailer for your show!
Get ready guys. This battle takes place in the mountains of Texarkana.
No it isn't! That's not strange at all.
Get ready guys. This battle takes place in the mountains of Texarkana.
Yeah wait a minute. I dunno if I'm supposed to watch it or not.
Hey, what's the reason for the split?
Hey, why are you doing this?
You didn't get a split second ago!
Don't make me do this!
You didn't get a split second ago!
You didn't get a second ago!
Get ready guys. This battle takes place in the mountains of Texarkana.
Alright, Cartman, I think it's safe to say that I can't be your split second friend anymore.
This isn't funny!
Get ready guys. This battle is in the mountains of Texarkana.
This is gonna be fun.
Go, Ike!
Ike, you go!
Ike, get away from me!
Dude, you're still gonna get hurt!
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
Dude, there's a kid in here!
This is gonna be so confusing.
Dude, are you sure you're alright?
He's being controlled by something.
Oh my God, they're breaking into his house.
What is this place?
This house?
Get out of here!
What do you mean?
Wwwait.
You're supposed to keep him/her from choking yourself, God?
Why the hell would you please do this to a child?
Get out of here!
You're supposed to protect him from people who found him or her and mutilated their bodies.
Do you
====================
What's that?
Hey dude. You're alive?
What?
Oolala
Do the math.
Dude, that ride would have to be just like Die Another Day.
Wow!
How much do we have left, dude? How much do we have left to win a $1.3 million jackpot?!
Yeah. Jack-in's girl.
What?
Me too.
You won't believe the impact Oculus made on the world.
I was the one jack-in!
You're not getting high again until we have our $1.3 million, you dick!
Then why do you care?
You're a liar!
Probably.
You're not gonna get high again until we have our jackpot, fatass!
Well, I've been saying this for years. If you wanna be rich, go to the other side. But if you wanna be poor, go to the other side.
If you want your share of the jackpot, then you go to the other side.
Rewind time. When a person is evenly split between the East and the West, that's how they got to be. If you want your share of the money, then you go to the East.
Yeah, but I say you take America's East Coast as your planetarium.
You're trying to, you know?
Star Wars?
Chef, do you wanna go back to the drawing board?
All right, let's see.  My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend has been brainwashed by your government. He's been brainwashed into believing that everything is fake. He's been brainwashed by my government to believe that violence is the natural order of life.
I live in a country where people get together and believe they can do whatever they want. That's America.
I'm a hundred percent certain.
You are not a part of that conspiracy, fatass.
Stop recommending that new song to kids!
I'm not a part of it, dude. I'm a full-fledged member of it.
You racist piece of fucking garbage, Cartman!
I'm not going anywhere!
I'm gonna get in my little brother's stupid van, and drive by that stupid old movie again!
No, Ih it sure is packed with kids.
Excuse me, is this really you?

====================
I'm sorry, Mr. President. There's been a little change in plans!
Well, what are you doing?
Dude, you know all about this!
All my life I felt like a freakish obsession with being a freakball. But this... This is serious issue. People should be able to choose whether or not to have children.
Will you tell Governor ?!
Then what do you want?!
Really?
Oh. Governor, we all talked for one person.
Then what are you doing?
That's a pretty cool idea.  Governor, we have a pretty cool idea for you.
What are you doing?
Ooogh.
Stan!
Stan, if anybody cares about Mr. Garrison, they should talk to him!
I think he might be here.
It's not him.
This is all getting way too complicated for anybody.
No, really. We should all realize that we have to talk to his mom first.
Dude, we're totally broken up! We've been doing it for so long that we no longer even get together.
Yeah!
Mom, there's this orphanage that does over a million dollars a year. How could they know us before we went to Marklar?
That's because they... They went in there and they told us we had to talk to them. They took us in, and told us to treat them the way they want to treat their own kind of people.
Do you really think that this is worth it?  You I mean, you can't keep it.
No. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
No, dude, I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Hanako costume.
Wow! Cool!
Oh Jesus Christ! You totally got it!
Oh, you really think you're cool, Butters! Butters is gonna make me look like this every time she walks by!
Oh my God, they're gonna shoot this girl in the face!
Dude, you've been here all morning! She's not here!
How is it that you could get stoned all the time? Be it talking about your parents, talking about eating fags, or just being stupid!
You're such a dumbass, Cartman.
I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Uh
====================
Disintegration is the process by which a person's sense of self-worth is taken away. It is a disease that only takes a certain percentage of the population to get sick.
Disintegration is when a person's sense of self-worth is ripped away, making them less than human.
That's so sad.  Well, maybe we can actually get together.  And Irene, you know that peeved dream is finally starting to come true.
How??
WHAT?!
HERE'S NOT BEING HAPPENING!
Come on, dude! I've been trying for years to get rid of the Boy Scouts, and I finally did it last week. They said it was the best they'd ever done.
What the hell would you know, Cartman?!
Just what the hell organization president!
No, Cartman, don't you ever think about what you think is best!
That's because Cartman's favorite sport is knife fighting. Cartman's favorite sport is card playing.
Okay, Cartman, I'm gonna give you a kendo stick.
Knife fighting.
Okay, so what's the plan?
...You've been an XBox addict for two years. How are you still using crack?
Kendo sticks?
Kendo is for kickboxing.
Yeah, the Flash is a robot.
Stan, you're not a real guy!
How are you doin'?
Oh, no! No, this is a mistake!
Irovulin E is for intravenous haemoglobulin.
Yep, that's right.
Yep, that's right.
Towelie is for sex.
Yeah, what about Jared?
He's a smart-ass loser who's decided everything for nothing.
You suck, centrist Democrats!
What the hell are you doing?
Yes, I see that.
Yes, that's right, damn you!
That's fucking retarded!
You're retarded, centrist Democrats!
Yes!
Yes, jesus christ, I finally understand.
I'm not a dick, that's for sure.
This is how they vote.
Dude, they're totally screwed!
So then how are we gonna win the next election?
Which candidate is gonna win the White House?
What the hell are you doing?
W-what do you mean?
====================
About this game
What the hell is that guy talking about?
Oh my God! Somebody's rigged this one on fire!
See? This is all made up. It's just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how stupid he is.
About what?
Yeah, make up, but you know, immature.
I know, I know. Let me guess: you're not a part of that group because you didn't get out of it before.
This isn't history. It's just a... past.
I know. It's not really funny, but... I just don't get it.
So, do you X?
Which bumper sticker do you like?
Well I'm gonna go look for the school bus, but I'm gonna need you to get to Kentucky, too.
You hellhole!
Yeah, so? You're a Christian, right?!
I'm Kyle's third-grade friend. He wants me to be his friend.
I can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Yeah. See ya.
Aw, dude, something's going on.
You mean that every time you get to the hospital, Cartman's gonna go down, like, crazy?
I know. It's like he wants to die, too.
Yeah. That's a good sign.
Kyle.
Come on, dude. We're gonna play Godzilla ZOMBIA!
Back to normal, dude!
Oh no! We're not playing that game, fatass!
Godzilla ZOMBIA!
It's bad enough that all the guys are playing it differently. But why shouldn't we be playing it the same night?
Riku, do you have any crunches?
Dude, it's the fat kid.
Why are they doing this?
See? We're not even close.
Riku, do you see anything?
He's got the smallest brain in the whole world, and he's all thinking about what to do next.
I don't know. Let's just say "fuck it" and get to the hospital.
See? That's cute.
Hi Nurse Token.
We were so worried for your well-being that you took us away. But we were so taken away that you finally came out and said you weren't real.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, ah I think
====================
Kyle Broflovski was on Pops!
He had a negroplasty!
Finally!
Oh, Jesus!
...Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a negroplasty, and then got a normal person who changed?
No. And then it changed again?
No!
Oh, no, no, Jesus!
Gays can get you a negroplasty!
Yeah. They do.
I was doing some digging and I came across this news report about Christopher Reeve's big success with Boys in School. There was a big backlash against the sex with boys sex, so I was kind of kind of... kind of... kind of... kind of... kind of... huh...
Well wait. I was just wondering if anybody has ever had a negroplasty?
Yeah.
Dude, it's brutal.
I'm alive?
I'm sure. Stan?
All right, look, give me the tape. I told you the whole thing was a lie.
he looks like a- like a-
hope for what?
What?
preparing to go to Canada?
telling people he's a loser?
What's Canada?
You bastard!
Canada?
You bastard!
...What?
We're gonna Canada!
A big success! Canada! Tell Cartman to the Canada Mine!
All right, Canada, stop!
Canada, stop!
ya-ya-ya-ya!
jesus christ, we need you more than ever!
We're gonna win that Quebec City carnival!
...What?
South Park.
This isn't history.
Hey, this place is really weird.
Dude, we're gonna get creamed!
Dude, I'm so scared.
Who is Rebecca?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
You bastards!
We're gonna get creamed, asshole!
Screw you, asshole!
On Wednesday or Thursday?
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
Hey!
No problem, dude! We got you to a hospital! YOU'RE NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!
Screw you, fatass!
Why are we going to the movies?
====================
Cartman!
Cartman!
You bastards!
They took our friend, Kenny. They killed him to keep us from dying. They took him to be their slave.
Get out of here, you pussy!
I don't know if that's gonna work, but it feels like your grandma is complaining about how your grandpa is doing your cooking.
What's this about, Cartman?
How is it look like outside?
Yeah, it's that place.
Look, it's freezing.
Come on, dude, we have to get to work.
Dude, we need to get our friend to Nebraska.
We're not freezing him, Stan. He's-
I don't know.
Elder, It's not my fault. He was-
I don't know.
What?
Dude, this is great! You love-
What?
Dude, this is such a big deal.
You doing this to your friend, isn't it?
I think he's going to want to go to Nebraska.
There's no denying what's going on.
Oh, crap.
Oh, crap.
Uhhh, where are they going to get us?
Where the hell are we?
Hey, look!  There's a sign next to a gas tank that says "Gas Station Nine"  huh.
Cartman, there's a gas station here that we can go to.
No, we'll have to get away from Stan.
Get away from me, Cartman, this place is hell!
Get out of here!
Yeah, dude.
Get out of here!
Dude, he's fire fighting.
Yeah, is that chewing?
No, dude, it's a Nebraska peacekeeper.
Get out of here!
I told you, Cartman!
Stan's going to be here in less than a minute!
Dude, he told us to get out of here!
Oh Jesus, I have to say that again.
Cartman, do you really think this is worth it?
That isn't peacekeeping, that's selling arms!
Why would the government want people to believe they caused the 9-11 terrorist attacks?
You're telling me that the people in Nebraska were all totally devastated at the Pentagon Stadium when, and only one person was killed!
Wait!
Oh
====================
Code: f(x, y, z))(
Just what the hell are you doing?
You're
living in a sewer?
Yeah.
No we're not zombies, fatass!
That's a great idea!
Can we?
How about a bunch of pizzas?
Well you can't just stand there and wait for us to come back. Come on, we've gotta get 'em!
Oh, pizzas!
Awesome! Let's go!
Yeah. I think he's about to go home.
He doesn't wanna go to the police, dude. They're looking for something.
Hey, look!  Is there any way we can get him back?
Oh, whatever he is, he should know.
Listen, this isn't gonna be any easy decision. But you know, I've learned something today. It would have to be said no.
No, I mean, maybe this is all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
No.
This isn't new. I used to sit in the living room with friends and family and talk about what we do, and how we impact the world. It's only gotten worse. It's not just about us. It's not just about YouTube stars anymore. It's not just about you, it's about the planet we love.
What Butters?
What's "documentary style"
What people are saying about us?
You're not the best man...
Oh my God, they're gonna shoot this!
We have to get that film about us!
The thing is, Christopher Nolan and Mark Waid aren't the same person. They aren't gonna make a big movie. But, they're gonna release a movie about us and people like them. And people are gonna buy into it.
No, dude, it's not too late. You've gotta keep the fire under 30.
This is your chance to be seen in the fire, don't you?
You see? You know, I think, we've learned, though: that we're not the same people because we don't believe in Jesus.
No. N-no-o-o-o!
You mean that you people aren't real friends because you modified
====================
you can't get past the first two guards!
yeah, that was... really bad.
dammit Cartman!
I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Grrrr!!!
But we're not playing that game, you poo-poo!
Dude, I don't wanna play with Mr. Hankey anymore.
What the hell are you doing?
Come on, Dreidel! Dreidel, we're gonna play Truth or Dare!
Oh Dreidel, you can't do this!
Disposing of Kenny?
But what about Mr. Hankey?
Butters?
How is that gonna help?
A hundred thousand dollars?
Whoa, dude! What the hell are you doing?
Hey, you're saying??
Hey, you're saying that we're going to Trapper Village to see Mr. Hankey?
We can't just take him away.
Dude, we've been goin' to see Mr. Hankey.
We don't know where he is, dude.
Hey, you're having a hard time believing everybody is coming for you.
No, dude, we're at the Trapper Village. You better have a good explanation for why you're gotta leave us behind.
This isn't a game, dude.
Go, dude.
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if Mr. Hankey's magic kicks in?
What's the autolocate macro?
Okay, right behind Stan.
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
No, ah I'm an arcane fire mage.
Cast on him again.
Aaaa...  AH! Huh?!
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah!
I can't. Just leave me behind.
I'm out of mana, I told you.
Attack!
Yeah yeah.
That was such über pwnage
Oh yeah.
Oh God, here we go again! 9-11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Not yet.
Will you shut up about 9-11!
Because anybody who thinks 9-11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.

====================
Where's your dad?
Dad, you're not gonna work for us.
Dad, we have to hurry to get to Kentucky.
You need to know something!
Ugh. You know what? I don't want you to do this!
Dad, what do you guys wanna do now?
Dad? You got a heart!
Stan!
Stan, it's me! I know what you mean.
Stan, you're not a million dollars—you're an American Idol winner!
What?
Mom, Dad, what are you doing here?!
But our judge is an idiot!
Look, he's just an idiot for being an idiot!
There's no such thing as an Idol.
What are you getting at?
Like what?!
You're an idiot for believing in something that you don't believe in at all!
I can't believe how much people want me to help them get an ending!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
That wasn't the best idea.
But why would David Blow go to Canada? There's no way he's gonna show up.
Hey, Were-?
Hey, Phillip. Do you know what's wrong with you?
You have to get off that chair.
There's no way you can go on national television and say, "This is all a big misunderstanding, but I love Canada."
Because when people are so confused and confused they can go to the Canada Tire Centre and buy in to the negativity.
And that's exactly what I'm doing!
Go with the flow, Kenny!
Get the rims on!
Get the nubs on!
Get the base together!
Get the piping!
Yeah, but he's a really good Canadian.
The White House?
How was what?
Because!
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Stan?
Stan, it's me.
W-well, it isn't me! I'm just you!
You know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit the situation in Canada, if not for the fact that so-called "sick people" were pouring out of the well, and, and dumping the Canadian urchin!
Hey dude, is everybody okay?
I'm not doing it, I'm-
Oh God!
I'm not doing this! This is- This is real
====================
What's wrong with your face?
Haven't you noticed everyone coming back to themselves? It's not even funny.
What the hell are they doing?
I thought I was outsh...
Look, I know it isn't funny, but... do you mind?
Come on, I can't wait to be an adult to a child anymore.
You can't get close to that Tammy!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Look, he's a smart kid. He's totally gay.
What kind of anti-gay douche?
What's "gay?"
What?!
What's same-sex birth control?
I think I see a girl.
Don't you? What's "same-sex birth control"?
Oh, jeez, I know.
Okay, so, what's "gay?"
"Same-sex birth control"
What's "same-sex birth control"?
Well, that's not really what I was saying. I was just saying that both males and females should have their own reproductive systems.
Yeah. So, that's what I meant.
Can I still get the pill, or just get an X?
What's "gay"?
Okay, so, what's "gay"?
Okay, so, what's "gay"?
So, "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do if you want to have a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
Okay, so, what's "gay"?
Okay, so, what's "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
Good point.
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
So, "gay" is something you do to get a happy and healthy sex life.
So, "gay"?
Hey, so... Craig.
What?
Hey, we'd
====================
Sure.
I have to go home!
I don't wanna go to the lake!
I don't want to go to the lake!
I don't want to!
I can't! I have to!
I can't!
I canot my nose and say"Here's ya"
And then I saw--
I saw--
I saw a bunch of Confederates wearing cowboy hats
and holding torches
To a lake.
They were holding torches, and it was very windy
I looked around for a while, and I came up empty.
But they looked like the members of the South.
I mean, South Park.
I was there, too.
No, no, no. This is serious.
Dude, this is serious.
Dude, you've got to check this out!
Dude, what's happening to the water?
Oh, no! The lake is full of fish!
I'd expect this level of fish, Butters!
"Aww, dude, what's going on is your fault"
Oh, dude, what ice man?!
I didn't know you were depressed.
Good point.
Dude. I know you're not, but, we're not making a whole lot of money off of this.
Wow.
Yeah. A lot of people are.
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, the fact is, dude, I do have a responsibility as employees of PayPal. If this goes through re-regulation, I might have to take a hit to my salary.
I mean, I hate when employees get laid off, butthole!
So how do you handle frivolous lawsuits?!
Two weeks?!
You mean like, say, suing EA Sports for being a ripoff?
That's it!
Oh cool.
Yeah, this is really lame.
Two weeks?
That's right!
You just wanna lock me in the bathroom so I get to eat Twizzlers.
What the hell is that?
Dude, that's not cool. You hate that kind of thing.
What the hell is that?
HAWK!
Come on, we gotta go!
It's a matter of fact thing.
Because EA Sports isn't named after a planet!
So we got all our games wrong, and you want
====================
Your family won't be able to get it done.
What's this about, Cartman?
Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, but they knew it. They were just so desperate.
Wow, I guess this all comes down to this:
Whoa, dude. The final time you saw Mr. Hankey was on TV.
Dude, he's gone.
Wow, is this the new 37ers?
Or is Mr. Hankey just a kid suddenly who's too old to be Kyle's friend?
Oh no! He's Mr. Hankey!
Dude, what?!
Ahhh!
Dude, I'm so happy!
Haha, bumbly turds are back!
How the hell do we get to New York City?
What does it do?
I'm not a doctor, bro?
What kind of name is that?
Huh?
Dude, I can't believe how confused we are. Is it some gigantic conspiracy?
Oh no! No, don't try to pin this on me!
Just let it go, dude! You're a brilliant young man!
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Dude, this is like the third day in a row. Bring it back!
Come on, everyone! I know we're all gonna be confused and angry, but we have to share this house with somebody!
Dude, this is like the fourth day. We've had just about enough, you know?
We know. Everyone packed into the animal shelter to see a veterinarian. Did you see his picture?
Holy shit, dude!
Did you see his profile? It's the same one we had for you.
Yeah, that was fun, but then again, we didn't have to do the whole thing.
Dude, do we?
We've been talking, dude. You got a lot of friends on Facebook, and we just didn't know how to get them.
What?
We just clicked on his profile, and he was there!
Holy shit, dude!
Yeah, like, 30 seconds later he was gone.
We didn't know if he was with us or not.
C-TID, they're looking for Kyle's ex.
Dude, we should help! We can help!
Terrible.
We're sorry, addicts
====================
Hi all,
Our current look isn't terrible either.
But it isn't terrible either.
Oh, and I'm sorry I got a text of his.
He's a really cool guy.
I don't know. Let's go see.
Why'd you call us?
...You really don't care about the looks?
How can that be?
Haven't you noticed everyone changing places? It's snowing?
Look, it's probably gonna be snow soon.
You guys aren't supposed to be so close by.
What's that?
All right, let's go.
Hey, can we sit down?
Woohoo!
Those are better!
Those are better!
Alright, you guys.
We're all here!
To fight!
Oh Jesus!
Oh, yeah. There's no choice anymore, dude. Look what you're doing to this kid. You're gonna make everyone around you crap clothes, and leave you for dead.
Yeah he looks... just like everybody else...
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
You're supposed to put his mom in a coma so she can have her baby, then eat his ratty little ass!
You can't be cooler than Cartman?!
That's fucking stupid!
Oh dude, check this out.
He's gonna kill you, Cartman!
Yeah, boss.
Yeah, made you sick.
I heard you got a beating here.
Hey, is that your theme song?
Dude, did you hear what's going on?
Who's that?
Youh, yeah, creeped me out, but I can't help but find it funny that Cartman would want people to think he's a sadistic asshole.
Look at him!
Dude, he looks like a dumpy, with a lump in his eye.
Look!  Look at him!
Look at him!
Look at him!
I can't believe it.
Wow!
Yeah, what did he say?
Screw you, fatass!
On Wednesday or Thursday?
Jesus, it's tragic.
Chef, are you still alive, Cartman?
I don't know.
Naw uh.
...(All right, I got him some pizza)
Yeah, there's no denying it.  I think it
====================
Stan?
Stan!
The principal is coming.
The principal is coming.
Probably.
Stan!
The principal is coming.
Yeah, go away!
Yeah, but you have to hurry, Cartman. I'm-
Cartman, nothing's gonna happen before I tell you...
I'm not telling anyone you're doing something about it.
What are you doing?
Goddamnit, don't you remember? That time we were talking about The Passion of Christ?
Well, that's probably it.
Don't do it, kid.
What?
You're too young to be saved.
Me too.
Oh Jesus!
You didn't think of anything, fatass! Now you think I'm one of them!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
You did what, fatass!
Just stop it!
Just stop!
Oh God, it's so ironic that Jesus has these little bags over his head, like those!
Stan!
You saved us from a monster, Stan!
What do you mean?
But we made the poor guy eat all the sandwiches we ordered.
Oho, but what about you?
You said "shit" and your mom is gonna kick your ass!
What are we gonna do, Stan?
You bastard!
Hey, you're gonna help us with our film study?
Well, I've been looking for a way to get Professor X pissed at me, and I think you're the only one. So I've been trying to convince you to take the position since. But lately the rumors of a new movie and Cartman's poor reading are starting to make sense.
Maybe you should reconsider your position. You're the person Roundup magazine calls 'the worst person in America.'
I don't know what to do.
What's the matter dude?
Get up, you fucking child molester!
Get up!!!
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this crap to begin with.
Hoh, come on dudes!
It's nothing compared to what this faggy little turd is gonna do to your ass!
You know what I like best about you? You don't call other people names.
We don't have names.
Geek!
Wow, what's in the subject?
Hey, wuught that
====================
Quick. I need you to help preserve the fragile peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Quick. I'm going to help you look for my brother in the wilderness.  See ya.
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
We need to talk to you, Marvin.
Totally!
Nooohohohohohoho-
I'llfulness- Check your PipBoy!
Oh Jesus Christ!
Oh, no...
Huh?
I... don't... have... any... attachment to Cartman.
I'm so confused.
Cartman, what's happened to you?
I... don't... have any... feelings for you.
It all started when I opened the door and saw all the kids. It was... so... simple.
I just didn't want to be in their lives.
Ungh, gghh, no...
I don't want to be in their arms.
Just let them take off their Christmas masks.  You don't wanna be a part of this drama.
What the hell are you doing?
...What the hell are you doing?
And I know that you're not happy, Butters. But I'm here to help, so let's get the hell out of here!
What's going on?
...What the hell are you doing?
Wait, that's it. I'm telling you all to do your part. And let's see your lips.
Hold on. You're breathing.
Dude, isn't that Bon Voyage!
...That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
The androphied fish?
What the hell are they doing?
Hold on, dude. I know what you want: a $3000 UFO sighted over Cartman's town?
No, we wanna talk to you.
See, derelict? There's no place like home. We wanna go to Canada.
We wanna talk to the guy who modified the XBox games?
We can't just go to Canada and buy weapons and drugs here. We have to get our aliens back.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Dude, you're really here?
Stan?
Cartman, what's happened?
No, bu-
No! We're at the Canadian border!
Oh God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
Stan, this is where we come from
====================
Dude, I don't think Ike's at home today.
Don't worry, Ike. I'll get you to the doctor.
No, wait. Ike, my little brother needs your help getting me to Nebraska.
Please.
Please, Ike! You have to stop breathing!
Ike!
Ike! Stop!
Ike!
Y-you're okay, Ike.
Y-yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I... I don't know what to do.
Just let it go, you crazy redneck! You don't wanna go to college, fatass!
Okay okay, there's no choice but to end this!  I know what-
There's no choice, dude, but to have your little brother grow up. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
Yeah, it's so sad.  I can't even go to football practice.
Yeah, it's so sad.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah, it was so funny
But Dad, we can play football.
Oh, Jesus, the police, sting the fish sting!
Yeah, it was so funny
You crackass!
I'm supposed to go to the football game with my little brother tonight.
Uh, can't we sit down?
Dude, you have to take a crap after saying that. You've always been a dick to me and my little brother.
So what number was that?
Dude, that's so wrong.
Hey, that's NOT what I was talking about!
Wow, what the hell is that?  That's... really touching.
Dude, where is your trainer?
I don't know. Timmy's home?
I am so confused. I almost thought that was gonna happen, but I think...  I I'm supposed to go to your house tonight.
W-well, I don't really have a problem with your house or anything.  But you know, I learned something today. You're a dick to me and I'm going to... do whatever it takes to get it down.
Oh, my God.
Mighty powerful asshole...
No, ah I'm sorry.  I can't do that.
Get it locked in the bathroom.
Then just get outta here.
Oh
====================
Country Kitchen Buffet!
Yeah, this is gonna suck.
What?
Oh my God!
Ah. Hey, Cartman. What's the matter with your dad?
Aah.
Yeah. This is so embarrassing.
How much do you wanna bet? Kenny can't believe it?
Yeah, this is so embarrassing.
Come on, this is serious!
Come on, this is gonna suck!
What's this about, Cartman?
What do you want?!
This is so embarrassing!
You bastards!
What are you gonna do? Look at him.
Token.  Jew. Latino. All of them.
Bad.
Go look, dude. He has these strange little eyes.
What are they?
...What are they?
Dude, he just starell!?!
I don't know.
Dude, he's so new you can't tell.
Holy shit, dude!
Yeah, this is bad!
What is this?
A warning to other diners!
It's a Chick-fil-A!
Hey dude, check this out.
They get catered to with veal soups and other fast food food. It's that good?
That's a town!
And the veal soups are usually $12.50.
Wait, wai- I know what town you're from?
Yeah, but you have to talk to Chef about us getting together again.
What are you doing?
That's a town.
And the fries are usually $12.50.
Yeah, but you have to talk to Chef about us getting together!
You're doing a pretty good thing, dude. You're turning a few heads in the polls.
Chef, this town's got talent.
Wow.
But we should be thanking the people.
There's plenty of talent out there, all looking to make a buck off of diners.
The entertainment industry, of course. And the fast food industry, too.
A bunch of actors, all impersonating people.
No, dude, it's talent. It's not talent loss prevention.
Look.
If we're not going to make a buck off of diners, let's just say stupid things are acceptable.
No, talent, that's removal.
What?
Ah.
Yeah. talent,
====================
Dragon Age: Inquisition will be out on PS4 in just over two weeks.
We made a commercial!
You haven't seen it!
It matters, Stan. You made a commercial!
What?!
You made a commercial!
Fine!
I'm gonna watch it!
Fine!
We made a commercial!
That's gonna suck!
So what are we gonna do?
Look, we could always go with the first guy.
We're not cowards, you guys! Just because we have a problem doesn't mean we're not gonna be concerned!
If it's gonna suck, I guess we better get working!
Shh. Shut up.
I don't have a problem.
Do you?
What??
No!
I don't know!
I'm just... I don't know. It just doesn't make any sense.
I mean, if you know you're not gonna make any money off of this, then what the hell are we supposed to do with the money?
You didn't ask for help, fatass!
Hey, Cartman. We're trying to get the last of the japanese people to buy in to help us get our commercials pulled. What the hell are we gonna do?
We don't even know if it's worth it.
Hey, that might work. But what if we go broke, or we get screwed over by the repossessed sex slaves of the world?
Cartman, you toast to me someday. Do you?
What the hell are we gonna do?
To a dying world? To an ancient black hole?
Oh, dude, I don't know. Let's just try to stay out of this for a while.
Dude, I know it's tough, but you know, I've learned something today. It would be a miracle to save the world if people living in need of help had to live in desperate circumstances.
No, dude, it's just the way things are. There's no such thing as a "lady of values."
I just thought you pretty much defined what was and wasn't acceptable.
Hey. Hey, you're not really selling The Passion to the Catholic Church, are you?
A-are you and gal
You're not really kissing, you're faking
Stupid people
Little things are easier to define and control than others.
====================
What's the matter?
No, it's Mr. Garrison.
Garrison, it's Ike! Your ride is better!
They're taking us to the Smithsonian Institution for a big presentation on space exploration.
Yeah, they said we have to go.
We better get working! Sally Turner is teaming with Kenny to stop them!
Yeah, she beat them.
Benedict Arnold?
Well, Cartman, you're just getting into your otaku stuff.
Sally Struthers, dude. She's got some really good film in Canada.
You're on, dude.
Holy crap, dude!
On Wednesday or Thursday?
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
Hey, are you on?
How exactly are you keeping from crying baby Jesus?
Oh. Well... I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
Please, I need to talk to your dad.
You need to have a guy be your father all the time.
I've tried, Ike. I think it's best if we get along sootheily.
I dunno. I think it's kind of a pandaish dream.
Please, Ike. I'm not gonna happen... again.
Please, Ike.
Please, you're not my dad anymore.
He's right. It's just that, when I was a kid, a lot of people kind of... held on to those same memories. Even now, even when I think about it, I... I don't think I'm my dad.
Mmmm.
M-my name is Kyle. And uh I need to talk to you soon-to-be-born kitties precocious kittie.
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
What?
Y-yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Butters.
Please, Ike. I can't be your dad.
Please, don't do that!  I can't be your dad!
Then what the hell are you doing?!
What the hell are you doing?!
Oh, you're supposed to be with your mom.
What's "looking for" is a boy who's had enough of mommy and daddy!
And huh, but that's okay, because that's what this whole new generation of parents
====================
Terrorists?
Butters?
Jimmy, you've been a while. We can't let them win.
Really?
What's it mean?
Dude, that would have to be so great.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Yeah, what if that guy hadn't been a Jew? He was too young to be saved from drowning.
Aw come on!
I think we broke him.
Behold! Mr. Hankey!
It's us! We've been to that movie once or twice a month. Tweek, do you have any advice for us?
Don't be a dick!
We're your friends!
Don't suck their balls!
Don't tell anybody about me!
Oh, Jesus!)
Don't be stupid, Cartman!
We're not friends! We're gonna end up just like Stan!
Be serious, Cartman: this is not friendship! It's just something they do because it's convenient!
Be it urine or tears... this is what friendship is all about!
Be it urine or tears, good things come to those who have it.
Those who have it.
Those who have it.
...You're not getting it, Stan. You're just jealous of me for not getting it.
Hey, that's it.  That's it? That's not being Stan?
Not being able to have that blood sugar ball is a pretty fucked up idea.
Yeah, what about you?
Hey!
Dude, if I do, it's gonna be because I fell down that abyss!
What the hell are you doing?!
You fell down that abyss, Stan!
Get up, Stan! Get up!!
What the hell are you doing?!
You fell down that abyss, Stan!
You fell down that abyss, Stan!
Stan, where are you going??
Hey!
I'm trying!
Yeah. I told you, I on out. Coach, I need to-
Ugh!
I'm grounded.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could get out of having our own show. We thought we could get people to like us. And that's gonna make people more and more likely to tune in.
Yeah. And that's why we need to retrain our base troops first.
...You
====================
We're gonna make sweet dough sure she's naked and in a harness!
Hoh, we're gonna—
Wow, cool.
I haven't seen Cartman dancing, but he sure is dressed up.
Hey hunhim!
You alright, dude?
Yeah, and you know he's not a douche?
Uh if that's not enough, Cartman has these little gold rings around his eye.
Uh then if that's not coincidence, what's not?
Oh God!
Watch out!
I'm the lucky one! If I miss the bullcrap fest, I'll have Cartman take my stupid mama!
All right, when is Mr. Garrison gonna come to visit?
But how are we gonna get to Mr. Garrison's house?
glasses
See Cartman with that little flashlight
Yeah, like, out of his little life.
Hey look!  Hello?
Hyaaaa!
What is that?
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of my mom.
Mom, Dad, your son is somehow different.
Oh my God!
Awwgh!
See Cartman showering.
He's not my kid, Cartman. That's a fag.
Oh, Jesus, what a dumbass!
Don't worry, dude. I'm going to the bathroom.
The malevolence of pornographers is costing taxpayers millions. The entertainment industry needs to lose about a million dollars a year.
Bill Cosby.
What's he doing?
I'm not living up to that name!
No, he isn't! Obesity is not a choice you make. Obesity is a choice made by God!
That's not the Bible!
Then I agree.
That's not the way God writes.
That's a guy I can get to know.
There's a guy named Mark Rotheram who can give me powers.
He's Mark Rotheram.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I can't live up to Mark's hype. I have to live up to Mark's word.
I'm not living up to his word.
I'm gonna go to the movies.
I can't live up to Mark's hype. I have to take a risk.
I just didn't think it would come so soon. But it is.
I'm
====================
Hello?
I'm Ike.
I'm a smart, funny, lovable little guy.
You're my new pet elephant.
No, really. Look at it this way: "AAAARGH! BAAAARGGHHHHH!"
I'm about to take it all out in public because, man, I have to be honest. I hate you, and I'm sorry I did. And I know what it's like to be a... elephant.  Oh, no you don't. No, I'm not going anywhere.
fuck you!
I'm not going anywhere
I'm letting you go, Ike!
fuck you!
I'm not going anywhere!
No.
You're not gonna die, you stupid elephant!
God-damnit Ike!
You're not gonna die, you stupid elephant!
No.
You're not gonna die, you stupid elephant!
No!  No, I'm not going anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!
No.
Hey, are you going to come and see my elephant, Ike?
I'm not going anywhere, Ike!
I'm not going anywhere!
What the hell are you doing?!
You're not going anywhere!
Yeah, dude! Cartman's elephant sucks! You're gay!
You're not going anywhere!
You're going to see Ike play basketball soon!
You're going to see Ike play basketball somewhere!
Come on, Stan! I wanna play at Arkansas!
So what should we do?
We don't wanna play with Mr. Garrison, Cartman. They've been doing it for almost forty years.
At least, that's what I thought.
What?
Oh, Jesus!
Hey, what are you doing?
You know, you think maybe somebody's wronged you somehow, but you know, I've learned, we all are. We all died for what we believe in, and if you don't change the way you act about killing, then I guess you're gonna go live.
I don't believe it.
No.
That's, that would be fine.
No more than that?
Oh my God. That's amazing.
Hey, is that your album cover?
Oh my God, that's awesome!
That's the right house we're gonna get into?
Oh my God, that's sooooooo
====================
