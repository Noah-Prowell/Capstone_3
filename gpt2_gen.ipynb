      "You guys!\n",
      "Oh God! I'm so bored!\n",
      "I just got home.  I just got home. IIe...  I just got to the hospital, and got infected with the like, kind of nefarious mind-control virus.\n",
      "Yeah. I just kind of lost the fight against the evil empire.\n",
      "My mom just died, and I was just like the other kids. I was in the hospital all day, and I just don't feel like it.\n",
      "You guys, it's just killing me.\n",
      "Hand in hand, you know. Just make me stop.\n",
      "Sir, you're being a fag, and I need to know how to fight back.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Hello. Wacky wanting to join the XBox crew.\n",
      "Yes. I've seen your film, and I like the humor.\n",
      "But I also know that, by making fun of people with disabilities, I could get people who wanted to join the faction but didn't know it was a bad idea.\n",

      "What?\n",

      "Got it.\n",
      "Hunh.  What the hell is a popcorn?\n",
      "Okay, kids, let's check out the menu.  Here's the deal, you guys. We recommend going with a hot, Japanese flavor.\n",
      "That's right. You can get the hot taste of ketchup, or you can get the hot taste of can chili.\n",
      "Hot...\n",
      "Oh, crap!\n",
      "I know what we're doing. This isn't news to you, guys.\n",
      "Oh, God, I don't even care about the chili. It's all crap and people should be able to buy it, right?\n",
      "You guys, come look here.  There's hot sauce over the... uh... sauce.\n",
      "Look, I know how you feel, Craig.\n",
      "There you see, guys, it's exactly what we needed. A new name for our game.\n",
      "You've got to be firm with us in this. Craig's mom is from Jersey.\n",
      "Ugh.\n",
      "We spent all night trying to get rid of him, you guys.\n",
      "We're trying to get rid of Butters, you guys. Here's a cool surprise for you.\n",
      "Oh, hey guys. How's it going?\n",

      "Aw, dude, what the hell is going on?\n",
      "What is this all about, Cartman?\n",
      "A picture of Stan?\n",

      "Cartman, what is going on!\n",
      "What's it doing?\n",

      "Hello, Cartman.\n",
      "Please come.\n",
      "I'm sorry, Cartman. My field of view is getting worse. I need you to come with me.\n",
      "Come on, come with me.\n",
      "YES, I know that! Please!\n",
      "Come on, we have to get to the hospital!\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "I can see clearly and without you it will be over!\n",
      "You see?!\n",
      "No!\n",
      "I can't do that!\n",
      "You know perfectly well what I'm talking about!\n",
      "Going back to old times, Cartman! I hate you!\n",
      "Man, I can't believe it.\n",
      "Wow!\n",
      "Do you really think that this is cool?\n",
      "It's cool because it shows them wrong. It can't be cooler than ours.\n",
      "We didn't believe you did it, fatass!\n",
      "Dude, you'd better watch the video because I'm going to show them the hard way!\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Aaaah!\n",
      "You're gonna freeze over dude, I know that!\n",
      "Stop it, Cartman!\n",
      "That thing is pretty cool, too.\n",
      "Yeah, it looks like a Earth Day present.\n",
      "Dude, it just seems so lame.\n",
      "Let's just get it away from your parents.\n",
      "Who are those kids?\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "But they're gonna be so bored on it, Cartman!\n",
      "Not if you...\n",
      "Mister...\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "...Homeland?\n",
      "Dude, what's going on?\n",
      "Wait! We don't have time for that!\n",
      "Dude, I think we're almost there.\n",
      "That's what happens when Homeland Security starts teaching kids the ropes and the stunts they're doing on TV? You know, we're starting to find out what's going on inside them.\n",
      "Don't worry, guys. We're getting good at this.\n",
      "Hear that? It sounds like water.\n",
      "You've gotta know about stunts and stunts doesn't it?\n",
      "See, we've learned something today. You're probably used to being security guards in a big, fancy place. Now you might have to learn to operate a check-cashing machine.\n",
      "See, we've learned that a lot of people are making stupid mistakes, and getting screwed up by them.\n",
      "Here's an idea.\n",
      "If we do a bunch of stunts, will you give us the money?\n",
      "Okay, here's the ending.\n",
      "Okay, hang on guys. You can call Scott anytime.\n",
      "Look, we're just trying to figure out what to do.\n",
      "Dude, totally. How much do we get you to part ways?\n",
      "Dude, he's a pretty special kid.\n",
      "I'mified!!\n",
      "I got the Ethernopian tube.\n",
      "I got it from somebody in China.\n",
      "How do we get graphene to China?\n",
