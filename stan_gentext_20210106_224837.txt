We wait for the police. Then they'll give us their video.
It shows the moment Kyle and Kenny get caught in a sticky situation.
Kyle, don't be so sure.  We don't know if you saw Cartman's wallet when you drank Kenny's body.
Maybe it was just a trick.  But we don't believe it.
Officer Barbrady, have the police video be the biggest thing that happens tonight.
Mom! Dad, don't tell the parents!
Hey!
Yeah, me too.
Be cool with that?
What?
For now, dude.
Video?
Okay, just go fuck yourself.
What?
What the hell?
Who's Boss Buh-bul?
Yeah, I wonder what that device was that the kids worked so hard to get.
Cartman?
Yeah, that's my uncle Jimbo's old fishing boat.
Yeah, it's big.
Cartman!
What the hell kind of flares are they using?
Hey, you guys! Check it out!
Mom, Dad! Did you bring the DVD!
Yeah, us too, fatass!
Why don't you guys just destroy the television?
Video?
Uuh, hey, we're parents to three little kids.
No, we don't understand why we should care about a thing.
Just leave the remote at that location, Mom.
Just, get near the television before we leave.
We want to watch the Super Bowl, but we can't do this on our cellphones!
Goddamnit, what now?!
Kenny?! What the hell is going on?!
Kyle, are you guys doing that viewing?
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Mom, video games are for people.
What?
Kenny?? You don't understand! If we don't get our video game back, like, oh, eight people today, then we're gonna be dead in a long time.
Yeah, anna, can you just tell us what the hell this is?
For what?
For taking down our movie screen saver?
Yeah, I think that's something to be proud of.
How, dude? We got blocked a lot on the Internet. We had no idea what to ask!
Hey
====================
No, it's not. Chef just asked us to help him cheat on our wedding promise.
We- we're not playing.
Come on, who's the demand guy?
Don't be so sure.  Chef always says that by having a good wedding, you make you a better chef.
What?
But then I thought I'd use your money to buy sparkly bracelets.
He's right. I thought I was going to them and got sucked into their prostitution rings.
I got sucked into their networks through eBay, and I just spent a lot of time looking for them.
Uh, if I buy sparkly veils today, I can get my status as a Boy Superhighway Instructor up to a whole new high!
I don't believe it.
Oh.
Yeah, I wanna learn how to weave.
Oh.
Cool!
What?!
But I'm not a smartass, you guys! I'm an idiot!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Warp drive disengaged.
Things that change directions.
They don't matter, I've seen that movie, and it's basically saying you're either with me or against me.
I'll go out the back so he doesn't get hurt.
Sirens!
I'm not a smartass, Kyle!
I'll go out the back if necessary.
What are you going to do, Kyle? I don't have any weapons.
Awgh! I'll never find them!
Come on, I'll be back!
You shouldn't be fighting me, you guys! I'm not gonna die!
Yeah, when do you think you're gonna get back up here?
Eighteen. Do you think we should fight or not?
Damn, dude. I've been sick all night.
Eww.
I'll fight. I whimpered in pain and then I lighted it up the next morning.
Yeah, fight or die.
I'm sure glad that's over with.
No, it's not.
I know.  You're kidding really? I'm glad that's over with.
Yeah.
Dude, come on! We're not being homosexuals, we're being silly.
Hey, yeah!
...I don't know what to do, dude. What about you?
Dude, are you going to be in Boy
====================
Trent Boyett is one of the smartest guys in the country. He knows all about assassination.
My dad is smart.
Yeah, he's smarter than that.
Dude, this is stupid.
What are you talking about?
Are you there, Dad?
Come on, Dad. We have to go check on him.
No.  He's just pissed off somebody found him.
We have to find him!
Come on, Dad, or else we're gonna kick his ass!
It is not!
YOU! Get the memo, Trent Boyett. What are you gonna do?
Don't say "shit", Trent Boyett. Say, "shit".
What are you gonna do, Dad?
Come on, Dad. We have to go get him.
No, Dad, we need to talk.
Dude, who the hell wants to start a family with his own little cult?
It doesn't matter, dude. The more kids you screw, the more you screwy you get.
Hey, you guys. What are you doing this morning?
Hey, you guys, we've got a big problem.
Cartman, you guys, we need to talk.
Cartman, there's been a lot of talk lately about how bad the AIDS crisis is here. You know, I think strongly that if we're gonna deal with this kind of thing, we've got to deal with it.
...Well, we shouldn't give in to it.
Okay, take the form of something else butters!
No!
I don't know, Kyle. Maybe we should just go home.
...I don't wanna be in a stupid cult, you guys have had it with your friends, and I don't know how to follow a young child!
What are you doing, Cartman?!
Okay.
I think we're done with you guys right now. Take it easy, you guys. Go find Motivation Corp.
Oh, no!
I have a new job and I'm asking veterans for it.
Yeah, I know.
There is a dollar sign in the Army saying, "Do Not Jump."
Nonono, not yet.
What?
Oh God-damnit!
Wait! Where are you going?
Oooo.
You guys! They said you had a million dollars there.
No, they
====================
Hi, my name is Stan, and this is Tammy's house.
We have a big problem. Cartman is taking pictures of our faces.
Oh, yeah, dude, so be it.  No, we don't wanna take any more pictures, and we just wanted to tell you guys something special's happened.
Yeah, of course.
Wendy, there was a fight afoot.  And then...
Tweek, how come you got kicked out of school?
We're really just trying to a life and death reunion.
Goddamnit look, can you get back in, please?
It was supposed to be a comedy club, but there's really not that much laughter in town.
Hey, hey, you guys.
We celebrating 100 years of music 'n dancing?
Wendy, can we please just let go of Tammy's baby?
Aaanhandh, let's just let it be its own thing.
Woohoo!
Hey there, little guy.
What the hell are you doing?!
Hey, you're the one doing the Yiddish games, go tell Dad about it!
You guys!  Everybody's looking for you!
Well if you haven't worked hard enough, you've come to appreciate that you have a responsibility to your own musical troupe. , 'Scuse me!  Hello, anybody?
We're sorry for interrupting, but we've got some important news.
It's really, really cool. We- we're really really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
You guys, is it true?
We've been on WFMJ for like, like, four years.
Wendy, you've been with WFMJ all along?
Oh, no.
It's true, dude. It was like the birth of our group mentality. We all want to be in a band and then we'll say the group idea for Channel 4 was a joke.
We didn't lie, Kyle. WFMJ was our joke.
We all got along great, but then the group started... going.
Kyle, it turns out that Cartman actually was the mastermind of the whole WFMJ thing.
You guys, listen. We've been trying to find you since.
...Steve?
Just stay still, Taco.
Hey, can we go now?

====================
So if you work in the entertainment business and you make money, that means you're more likely to get noticed than others to make money.
I don't believe it.
Yeah. The New Yorker.
Oh, well. I'm sure they'll find out about it.
I don't know, it's- a business?
What?
Butters, where are you going?
Cartman is the biggest douche!
Oh my God! Dude is weak!
God-damnit, I guess nobody else will be able to lift a finger to help those in need, you know?
It's either deal with Cartman or go back to normal! We're not gonna be able to help anymore clients!
Or we'll go back to normal.
We can't do anything.
Cartman?
You don't understand! Kenny's disabled, and we can't do anything about it!
Dude, we can't take Kyle's ass out of him.
Kyle, you've gotta do something. Say the names of the gods at the bottom of the screen! Then everyone can know that the people on the bottom floor are actually the ones who can't do anything right now!
Come on, we've gotta find that person who can't do anything right now!
We've gotta name that person after Kyle!
Dude, we gotta go get him!
Whoa, you guys!
Can you name a single thing that happened that week?
No.
At school, we all used to play together, but we didn't do any singing.
All right, let's go to the movies.
Hiya, Sparky.
That's our new house. It has the same look as ours, but it also has the sign with the words "growl at me" on it.
Wow, cool!
We got a star on our new house?
What does that mean?
What is that?
We just got a star for being able to sing!
Wow, cool!
Heyhey who's that fat chick?
Uh Wendy.
Yeah, smells like pee.
Wendy, what the hell are you doing, fat boy?
Yeah, smells like pee.
Wendy, what the hell?
Come on, we've gotta go get our new neighbors.
Neighbours?
Dude, they's the farthest
====================
We wanted to make sure that whenever Kenny says "Bitch," we got his mom as soon as we got the bus!
Cartman?! You can't just come to a debate about this, asshole!
Hundred-nine dollars.
Yeah. We'd love to hear your side of the debate, but... we don't know what to do based on what we see on the news.
Aw, crap.
Mom, Dad, don't you hear what we're saying?  Shelly, you screwed me up!
What?
I think Barbrady's curse is real.
So then we can't use it in a weaponization program?
Uhh, $apprentice?
Apprentice? What curse would that be?
This is a valid use of the curse rating system, so how come you couldn't just ask them.
There's no way Kyle can prove he was in Cartman's room before you did, so you have to jug them up.
You didn't throw food at them, dumbass!
They weren't hungry, were they?
They're rich people, huh?!
Hey, I didn't throw food at them, I FINALLY HAD A BITCHASSMENT WARRANTIY!
So what are we gonna do?
What are you gonna do, bitchass?
Then bitchass!
You assholes!
Alright, come on, we're gonna Carolina.
What?
Jesus Christ!
Hey, wait a minute. What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna be in charge of getting Barbrady a new bra.
You Barbrady, you wear a bris.
Oh my God.  You've gotta help me bridge this!
What? Dude, that is stupid.
We're just gonna have to carry him to the bathroom.
wire?
no
But Barbrady, is it possible that the bracelet on your wrist is the bracelet on Chef?
Come on, Chef.
You alone is not sufficient, Barbrady, you have to help us!
Wait! Wait, what are you doing?
What bracelet?
What bracelet?
What barrel?
Come on, Barbrady. We have to succeed in this game.
No, you can't do that!
Oh God-damnit!
Kenny?! You can't even describe what's wrong with this game!
====================
I'm not singing a song, I'm talking about the importance of ziplining! All you have to do is sit here and practice, okay?!
Hey Chef.
Bad.
Chef, where's the other ziplining headache?
Oh no, what now?
What about Chef?
So now that I see how much you're gonna be okay, I think I have a plan B.
What does that mean?
Alright Chef, I'm gonna take your dog to see Maleficent.
So now that I see what's on TV, I think I have a more in-tactile idea...
Why does that matter?
Now what do we do?
Chef, where's your duffel bag?
We don't wanna look at it, Chef. What's wrong?
Cartman, don't be such a pussy!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You've got to suck his clit, or else Brazzers will find out what a secret he is!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
This is gonna be so boring.
Uh, cool, how are you doing?
Uh, I'm sorry.
It's just a stupid list, Brazzers.
You guys, we're just gonna go back and clean up after Cartman.
We Britney Spears kids?
We got it, Britney!
No, you're a Britney Spears bitch!
I won't wear whatever I want, K-13!
IDENTIFICATION COUPON!
For just being a nice little bris, I guess.
Hello?
We're not spies, just interns doing our own thing.
Well, we didn't even know that.
Well, anyway, we just wanted to tell you what kind of stupid frisbee you were.
Funny how things are now?
That's not true!  Dude, we didn't even know that.
And you're a douchebag like that!
B-b-b-b-thing?!
That's not cool. You can't be a douchebag like that.
Oh, cool! You're the one who made the list!
How do you know?
Because we started this page yesterday!
You're
====================
Please wait, my friend, my heart is with my friend! ...Kyle? ...I don't know what to do here.
No problem.  Now you guys, we're gonna go kill Kyle and cover him up.
I took him to the hospital. He's okay.
Yeah, anyway, we have to get him to the hospital. Kyle's okay.
Oh, he's okay.
Dude, he's alive!
He said he came to save us.
Where are you going?
Hey! Whoa, dude!
Wha-what?!
Where's Chef?
Oh, nice going, you assholes!
Wow, cool to meet you!
What are you doing, dude!
Yeah, it's- it's cheap shots and conspiracy theories and stuff and you guys are just busy trying to get money out of a company that makes crappy TV.
Zippy was trying to buy Channel 4 in town.
You don't ever catch a commercial for Channel 4.
You guys, we watched the commercial for this new show and it was awesome!
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude!
...But they're building another door. I wonder how fast they can get this front door to say "STOP"!
I hope they can.
They've finally got it.
It's just a stupid lie, Chef. Show us how much it takes to get Kenny elected to power.
Yeah, we all need to just shut up and let the stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid adults decide what we do with ouryrights.
Hey, whoa whoa, dude!
Man, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I learned something today.  At some point, you needn't just allow somebody else to take over, you have to accept that somebody is going to take over. I think we should all accept that somebody has got to take the lead.
There's no more responsibility, there's justoner. I would guess that at some point, you and I decided that if we all wanted to continue playing video games, we'd start taking responsibility seriously.
It was a dumb idea, it was dumbassery, and it was stupid.  But now, as we mature, we'll all learn that we were sovertisingly petulant at first, that we actually acted out sick, and that...   ...I'm
====================
Time Records show that in America, there are now over 200,000 days on record.
Wait a minute! Look!  This is not a dream! This is real!
TimeIsMovingWell.com is a live feed of the fifth grade from Kindergarten to Grade 10 from San Francisco, Calif. on Monday, November 4, 2010.  This is the real deal!  All we are asking you to watch is the hardcore wrestling show, Butters' Whore.
Here it is.  This is it.
The real deal.
This is all the kids from the hardcore wrestling show who were supposed to be at school on Monday night.
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't be having this fun.
I'm having the best time!
The Canada Syndrome?!
What is that?
Dude, what is it?!
What about the Canada Syndrome?
What is this?!
Kyle, I want you to watch the Canada Syndrome, but you won't see Wendy!
No!
So what do we do now?
What are you saying?!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Man, did you watch the Canada Syndrome? It was fun.
I don't get it.
This is Canada, dude.  It's a homosexual slur.
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you saying?
Yeah, what a bunch of kids.
What the hell did you do to deserve that BJ?
That's a K-Mart gift.
No, dude, that's a fake.
Yeah, Wendy, we've been through a lot together.
Yeah, but it's just a stupid show about retarded people getting sucked into a stupid show.
Yeah, don't you see? This is too much of a distraction.
It's time you went to bed.
Do you guys get it?
Damnit, Can you do it again?
Kenny says he has a bunch of questions he's wanna ask Steven.
What's a dildo?
Where are you going tokyeah?
Why the hell does a dildo have to give?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that's worse.
Dude, this isn't a show about boobs.
What's the big deal? Dildo-man is just trying to make people think that Endymion gets stopped all the time.
====================
They've been tracking him all along. It seems like the right thing to do.
Yeah. He's got to be worried about us.
Come on, who's to say: robots aren't back in the 80s?
We've gotta get this thing back on!
Dude, the arcade machines are back in their original glory!  We've gotta get this thing back on the old machines, or else we're gonna get sucked into this new one!
Hundred bucks, no big money, no rubrics! Uh, we wanna play Guitar Hero!
Oh yeah, we've gotta get that new controller!
Oh, hello? How are you feeling?
Yeah, it's that stuff with the missing doll.
Here that up there, kid!  I wanna play the new GameSphere controller, too.
What?
What the hell is wrong with that guy?
Come on, we've gotta hurry and get this tape somewhere else!
We've gotta get this thing back together!
Jeez, the arcade sucks! Is it any wonder Sega crashed the chance at a $1.1 trillion global business?
Come on, they're taking it out on the corporate giants.
Hey, hey, guys.
You guys, we're gonna buy every Sega CD in the world, and destroy them all.
What?
Yeah, dude, that's all you've been doing.
Ah, hey. We want to talk to you about the record store.
Yeah, huh.
Sso?
Uh, we're sorry, but we've got bad news.
The arcade sucks, and we can't play back the tapes ourselves.
Oh phew.
Okay, so what we're gonna do is take all the crappy tapes and put them back in the record player.
Yeah, dude. If we go back and play them, the bad guys are gonna come and take those records to the Super Best Friends for some action.
Uh, we want to make sure that as much of a hit as you make those copies become, we guys, then we can start playing!
W-what?
A hundred bucks? Ah, yeah, that's right.
Excuse me.  We wanna see how much we can stack against the better records.
Hey, that's right. Records are art, remember?
Dude, we're just gonna have to wait until
====================
Uh oh. Maybe it's the dress code at Nike commercials. I'm not sure.
Oh hey Dad, why don't we just ask them to leave a deciphered message for Phil Collins?
Come on guys, we're not being spied upon!
Come on, we're just trying to leave a message. Maybe they knew each other at school.
Come on, guys, we're just trying to play.
Kenny's a perv, dad. Don't let him get away with being a perv.
What are you talking about?
Come on, guys, let's go play ball!
Come on, guys, we're not getting closer!
Dude, this is creepy.
Excuse me.  Excuse me, can we please just talk about the actual Slaughterhouse 4? It's about to start.
Just for fun, I'm of the opinion that when the game starts, the player with the higher score on the power play will be the one who killed the last creature.
I don't know, dude. I'm just glad this is over with.
...No, I didn't send them in, Kyle. I'm, I'm just asleep.
Well whatever it takes, Evil Geniuses, you have to give it to us.
I'm just dreaming.
Goddamnit, that guy is dresed up like an Indian.
He even has facial hair.
You're not gonna believe that, Kenny.
Yeah, I guess we all are.
Hey, what's that?
Yeah, yeah, we need to get get out of here.
Oh shut up, J-Totally dead.
I don't think we're Indian, we've been here a long time.
Look, there's no problems. The only thing that's gotten in the way of the other team is the Native Americans.
Yeah, we can't tell you where it is, dude.
What?
Dude, we can't tell you where it is, okay?
So there's nothing we can do except get out of here.
Dude, we're trying to go to the mall.
You mean the one where you were standing and waiting for all the Native Americans to come back and help you?
Cartman, you idiot!
That isn't true! We, we were there!
Dude, we can't go
====================
What if the Chosen One were our friend?
Hey, where's Clyde?
What would our new friend do, Chef?
Yeah, he'd be rad.
Hey, Chef, what the hell are you doing?!
Dude, that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that!
Well, what does it say?
Yeah, but, we'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going!
Cartman, you idiot!
What the hell is going on?
Whoa. Dude, not cool!
Huff, huff.
Huff, huff.
Huff, huff.
Oh!
...Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
It is... true. We went to the movies. We went to the casino. But... it was wrong all along. The movie companies didn't like what they saw. They just made it so we couldn't tell you what to believe.
...I don't understand, Chef.
Just go away, dude. We're not gonna make it.
You're gonna have to go to the big party at the next house.
You'll see. We were gonna make it in time for the concert to be held at the end of the road.
But the big dance studio wasn't big enough. We had to go.
I didn't. I wanted the stage to be bigger than The Lion King.
Oh God-dammit!
Aren't you, Chef, we have to go check out the big screen?
You guys, we really, really do.
Cartman just pop-flopped on the big screen.
He looks at the screen, he thinks it's perfect, and then he looks at the stars.
Yeah, listen: there's a dance competition out there, and one of the contestants gets crowned king.
You can be the best!
All hail the Princess!
I guess you're right, Chef.
Oh yeah, we can vote! 
Okay,  Okay, let's see... Jesus, is this the fifth estate?
The fifth estate?
Dude, the fifth estate is another country.
The fifth estate doesn't seem to be a problem anymore.
But Mom, all the kids are pissed off at their parents. What's the point of living when the kids
====================
Dude, I'm really pissed off at my best friend.
I know!  I really can't believe that asshole!  Why do you keep saying that guy spends all his money on bottled water and random crap?
He's a total douche!  Oh, he- is he a friend?
We?
Aaaah!
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these people how an asshole spends his money, he takes it!
No dude, that's not Malibu!
Where?
Uh hey, Chef.
Why don't you guys just tell the people here at the TV station? They're just trying to steal our lunch!
You guys, are we gonna be able to sleep while we're at it?
Well okay, so than of course we can try to wake up that reporter tomorrow.
But there's no way we're still sitting at that desk. Chef, we've only been at the station four hours.
Oh dude, now we're really screwed.
We're gonna go to Barbrady's to get our food. Come on, guys!
Not here! Come on!
Just because we've spent so much money on fancy cars doesn't mean we have any choice! We have to be able to sleep now, okay?
We can't go to Barbrady's for the weekend! We've got to get our food and drink from Barbrady's!
No dude, that's not Barbrady's.
Dude, we've been through a lot like this.
It's called hunger-striking. You've never seen a pig?
Wow, really?!
Where are you going?
But what can we do?
No, I'm not gonna get zapped. I want to go home.
Okay, I think we're clear.
We... don't want a n-o-nigerian-an alien war, but, we're never gonna have a n-o-nig again.
Oh no!
I'm not gonna Miss.
Dude, Miss. Spears won't talk about the hurricane anymore, okay?
You're not gonna get sent back in the alien's direction, okay?
We've gotta find a way to get back at those aliens.
Sweet!
But we can't go back in the alien's direction, okay?
There must be something
====================
Stan, I have to go to school tomorrow.
No, no, my dad says I have to stay with Stan for the rest of the year.
Are we in trouble?
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
Can't this thing be saved?
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then the next day, then there was this big big big big big big white big white big white big cloud cloud cloud ...wherefore, can you tell us where Jesus was lead on a big white white white cloud ...to be exact.
Look, this is very simple. Jesus was to save men and women from doom, and he's also peace.
It's not a big deal. We can just read and write and not have any problems.
Yeah, pretty sure. Ok, where to go then?  Oh right. A dance class?
No! ...Yeah, that's kinda gay.
What are you talking about?
No, that's too gay!
No, you can't be serious!
No, you can't be gay, you're a gay man!
So what are you going to do, Wendy?
Get into that Dave Chappelle guy!
Why do you say that?
See? They're straight.
They aren't straight. They're chummy.
That's not true.
I mean, dude, isn't that what gay people are into?
What's the big deal? What's the big deal?
What about Timmy? I don't feel like doing my chores.
I don't know.
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!
Yeah, Timmy, I'll kick you in the nuts, and you guys are all doing all the talking, okay?!
Well... I guess, maybe, maybe you shouldn't be mad at me for being gay.
Huh?
I don't know.
Come on, you guys, we have to do this.
Okay, let's see: Jesus performing miracles, some people are doing this and selling out their Friday classes.
Dude, you cured all the sickly people in America?
Curious how much money that person is making, huh?!
I don't know, I dunno.
Mom, I just gotta get that John Elway football helmet back.
...Dude, that's not Jay Cutler's fault
====================
Oh, really?
...What?
Oh, dude, I have to go to school tomorrow.
What's he saying?
I'm getting on that plane.
You guys, are those actual Canadarm dancers really back home?
Oh my God.
Towelie!
Yeah, when do you think you gonna get that big black plastic boat?
I don't know, dude. I'm- I'm here only a few feet away.
Dude, who the hell wants to play in the commercial break?
Dude, you taking the bus?! W-what are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?!
You guys, we need a third of the way through. I wanna go back to the old M-80.
It's just that. M-80.
Dude, never mind. We have to go back to the old M-80.
It's just that, you know, I have a friend who is now 28 and he needs to use the old roller coaster for his business.
Yeah, dude, it's not that big a deal.
Come on, we gotta get back to the mall.
We're getting to the mall first.  There, I'm sure.
Cartman, I'd like to take a look.
What the hell kind of glass do you have here?
Hey, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ!
Hey, yeah, I'd like to use the old roller coaster for my business.
What the hell kind of stupid glass do you have here?
Hey, I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You've been away a long time and you don't understand.
You guys, uh... we?
I don't understand at all. You know, I don't understand how people can use a bus when they're sitting around and it has some problems.
You guys, I think this is really dangerous.
This is a bus, dude! It has to have at least one person on it!
What the hell could go wrong?
God-damnit, this is really dangerous.
We have to get this thing out of the hands of people who want to shoot us, dude.
Come on, we've got to get it out of the car.
Oh no! This isn't safe.
We're getting to the bus
====================
Hey guys,
It's uh-Boy.
Yeah, he was uh-... aw, never mind.
What's up, Kyle?
What's going on?
Uhhh, tell us about it.
You were right, Kyle. We should all take down the U-Haul. It's really important.
Yeah!
You were right, Mr. Garrison, it's really important.
You didn't want the U-Haul in your life, you just didn't wanted it to be overplayed.
Yeah, u-uh, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's really easy to ignore the u-igenactment whole, too.
Look, dude. A U-Haul? Dude, there's no way thatAAAA is u-igenactment.
Oh, dude, that doesn't make sense.
No, dude, that's just math.
Dude, the world is too big.
I don't know, meh, maybe we could... make a small business?
My dad says I have to do something. I say I can make $10,000 dollars.
I'm not calling the manager up about $10,000 in cash, meh-Okay.
Hello?
Aww! My dad's complaining to his superiors about my company getting sucked into too-big-to-hier-une banks account.
Yeah, I just got sucked into too-big-to-hier-une companies, okay?
I just thought it was because I'm too-big-to-hier-une.
Oh, my God! They've killed-
Kyle! Kyle, don't!
I'm sorry I tried to help you, you fat piece of shit!
No, I'm not happy about it.
Oh yeah, I can't stop thinking about it.
What, you complaining to the managers?
No, I didn't break any laws. I didn't break any culture.
Dad, I changed my mind. I'm not sorry about anything.
No, I just don't feel like cutting it out.
There's no way that I could have made the investment, right? I learned that from Scott Malkinson, the man who put me through school based on what my parents told me.
I'm not lying, Kyle. I really, really wish I hadn't listened to
====================
People are dying this way in San Francisco! We have to make up our own luck.
We can't make up our own luck, you stupid Britney! We've come to bust you out of your crystals!
I wasn't busting out your balls off, you stupid Britney! I bust out your balls!
Woof!
You guys, you guys! Wake up!
We blew up the sea snake!
We didn't, we didn't, we just screwed up!
Not yet.  Mana Burst!
Everyone back up! Cartman, do this!
Yeah, dude, we'll show you around town.
Oh, they're not.
You guys, you guys!  Roosters!
That's not a way to kill Kenny!
No, that's way, that'd be gross.
What are you talking about?
No, that's not neato.
Kenny'da said he was going to buy a hunting-line tank.
Uh-oh.
That'd be sweet.
Uh-oh.
But Mom, I don't think we families need each other anymore.
Yeah.
You mean,that company that makes the stuff that makes lead?
What, Chef?
But then why are you so into their business?
What is it?
That'd be sweet.
Butters, we'd love to meet you.
Well, what do you need most?
At least a pussy.
Yeah, dude. I mean, at least a pussy.
What do you mean?
Alright, I'm gonna enter the loo and I want to enter the loo while wearing a bunny suit.
So I need to enter the loo while wearing a bunny poncho.
So I'm gonna rabbit-rabbit through the house.  Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
I'm not playing, I'm answering this phone.
Hi, ma'am, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, what's happened to the Internet? It's an awesome thing that can make people live better lives. But it's been for a long time just sitting there.
Can I talk to you now?
It's a simple question. Where do I go from here?
What do I need?
That's impossible dude, we don't even know where that is!
====================
Kyle, you have to cheer up. You have to.
Dude, I can go to church. I'm eight years old.
No, you're not gonna cheer up, Kyle. I'm sorry I tried to you.
Just let me go. I will.
Oh, God, this looks horrible.
Oh, dude, you've heard that one time...
Forensics?
Dude, what are you doing here?
What?
All right, fine, all right, screw it, we have to go.
Well how about we take Kyle's kidney?
That's a city-wide ban, too.
Oh, but that's a start, dude.  It's not good enough just because a person is a douche. Be careful what you wish for.
Okay, what's the- ABC, I'm wrong.
Okay, come on, the odds are in favor of against!
Come on, They've gotta be really, really smart in this game.
They do it all with the Internet.
It's just and simple sucks.
I don't want my dad or mom or whoever to have fun in school today.
Oh, dude, why would we want to take a picture with that nerd?
Hey, hey, that's cool!
What?
AAAH!  What?
That's not cool.
Just get with the times, dude.
Hey, wait a minute. What about me?
What?
I'm sorry. I just have to.
Uuh, hey, uh, it's a- kinda for a while.
Yeah, but it's all over for me.
I don't remember.  Aaah.
I'll be back with my band, you guys.
Dude, I really have to go to lunch today.
Dude, what are you doing?!
Hey, hey, we're gonna play Radiohead at the same time!
They did a show at the same time as Faith Hill's house?
Dude, what are you doing?!
Yeah, they did a show at the same time as Faith Hill's house.
What?
Yeah, let's just go see what Bono has there.
Really?
Dude, it's the middle-class white kids' club thing.
What is that?
I don't know.
Come on, we
====================
I think this is the quintuplets' room.
Hi. Could we have a scoop on what they used to make cookies?
Well, our quintuplets are staying with us.
We went out to lunch and-
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Look, you guys! We just learned that Antoine got himself a pumpkin.
Wendy, toothpicks?
Dude, it's our dads.
We've just gotta find something to eat.
We've made a deal: if a company give's us something, we'll give it to them.
We don't wanna go hungry, you guys.
Yeah. We'll make yer cake, Kyle.
Dude, toothpicks?
What don't you mean?
Yeah, Kenny says he has a really awesome show on Tweek.
You doing it?
Yeah, and Kenny says he got a million dollars.
Well, what do you mean?
I dunno.
Uh, we'd love to, but--
It's not--It's not--
Kyle, are you having a BJ?
What what's the matter?
Uhhh,step mom.
Dude, we can't go anywhere.
Mom, Dad, we need to ESCAPE our cable.
Dude, we're gonna be in a repeat.
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Dude, we're not leaving until you tell us you're leaving.
Oh, nice, straight jacket, no nail.
Dude, we just got a new coat, remember?
What is that?
No, there's blood on the outside.
Wow! Look! Cartman!
Are you all right, Cartman?
Dude, they've taken Kenny's ass out of Kenny's ass.
It's all right, Cartman. You can't take Kenny's ass out of him.
Dude, just like the way your parents made cookies, you made cookies.
What?
Dude, look!
Come on, guys.
Wait a minute!
What! ...I don't like this new coat. It's like they've been trying to tell me what to do all this time!
Oh, brother! I'm not a stupidass!
Hey, where's Cartman?
Where's he?

====================
That would be sweet.
That's right.  Sir?
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Sure. I'll see you later.
Ah, hey. I was just trying to save face after seeing Tom Cruise in a hospital gown.
Agh, I gotta get home for school.
Shut up, Cartman!
I didn't think so.
Oh, hey Dad. How's it going?
Yeah, now you're carrying me to term?
What, Dad?
Whoa, he was trying to say that fatass in the military.
No, fatass, let's go home.
What the hell are you guys doing at this point?
Alright, guys, this is gonna be so embarrassing.
Let's just pretend that everyone else in the house is retarded and let our parents know what we're doing wrong.
Okay, whatever.
Dude, how are we supposed to act when we act like this, and then somebody says, "But but it doesn't matter, you're a Bono guy"
Man, it's just a big fat black thing
Dude, these people are insane.
Huh?
Oh dude, did you know that before? Did you know that when Bono said his song's over, the South was like, "The South doesn't love its artists."
No, it was just a big fat black thing
Hello?
What? Who-who is this?
Book. Come on, guys.  Hey! This is the guy we saw in school the other day!
He's a kid in his early thirties, maybe thirties yet.
Yeah, who doesn't know that?
Yeah, well, so is your mother.
Mom? M- my name is Stan, and last night, the Bonoists came to my house and took me on a fishing trip.
Yeah, me and Kenny were just about to tell the Bonoists about my dad and he said he had a big black projection screen on him
I-I don't know, me or him.
Just me
Yeah, me and my friends.
Me neither.
Uh me in the back.
The theater?
Well you didn't want me to scare the Bonoists, you said I could be one day.
Where did you get that?
Dude
====================
Quick, I need a signature. I need to get this signed so I can get on the ramp.
Quick... signature it!
Hey ah, you guys. We're here to do something totally different. We'd like to ask you a question.
If a guy on a horse is faster, better, Irene.
You've got to give us a second look, dude. Somebody's taken Kenny's place.
No, you don't understand. We want to get to the bottom of this.
What do you mean?
Then you shouldn't be able to get to the roof.
No, you shouldn't be able to get to the roof, OK?
Theicer isnt me, Irene. I've been banished. I've had it all.
No wonder he lost to me last year. He lost to all of us.
No, you lost to all of us last year.  I lost to you because you didn't give us enough credit. Because you didn't give us enough for our names to appear on the football field.
Irene, you said that when you first got banished you tried to be the best person for our company, but then, then you got banished, and now you're the best person for our company.
Can you explain exactly what that means?
You weren't the best person for our name, Kyle, that was all.
All right, I'm sorry if I'm not up for this, but, uh... I have a feeling that if we don't get out of here, things will get ugly.
We're trying to take everyone on
date away from everybody.
You're not the leader we wanted,

Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, guys.
Yeah, this is gonna be so ugly.
Oh gosh, there's a big goose in here.
I'm not scared of the big scary monster. I, I can't get to him.
I'm not the leader, I'm not the head alien guy, but uh, you guys are right that we had to go through all this, and apologize to everybody.
I apologize to everyone for having you as a second friend.
It's just, you know, I was just trying to be good and make friends. I, I didn't realize it. I was depressed. I had this whole messed up dream about you and
====================
When did we get to this?!
Oh come on guys! It's our dads!
They didn't know us. We didn't even wanna get to this half-pipe.
We gottin' pajama-cheesy from the guys on TV!
Tweek?
So?
I don't know.
Mom, Tweek, if you see Tweek, he's got something on Tweek.
Tweek's right. We were in a fight all by ourselves. It was between a bunch of dead people.
Yeah, why don't you all just let us go have some tea, okay?
It isn't fair! Why can't we just let our guard down?
Hurry up, stupid stupid crucifix!
God-damnit, will you guys put on the gas mask and get the tape returned!
We're the ones who didn't put on the gas mask, Jesus!
You can't fool me!
Put on the gas mask, Jesus!
What the hell are you doing getting put on the gas line?!
Huh?
So you're on the line of Duty?
Tell us how we can save the world!
It's Tweek! He just got crucified in front of me!
So I don't get it.
Well, I can't believe it's all over.
Let's just wait until the cows come home.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Mom, Dad? What's up?
Where are you and what's wrong?
Yeah, wait, you can't walk, Dad.
You've gotta do something, Dad. I, I don't know what I'm doing.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Why the hell not?!
Yeah, he's kicking the crap out of Cartman already.
You guys, hey, what are you guys doing?
It's time to go home.
Dude, we gotta get home and then we can go to school.
I don't want my job back! I want my freedom to go back to Somalia!
Why?
Well, it's not like we're gonna get back at all Jiang Zemin people for it. I mean, just... we're not gonna get out of there like you guys.
All right, go, and get lost!
What the hell is going on?!
Hey, what are you guys doing?!
====================
A mad scientist is trying to find a way to stop us all from making sweet love in the future, by using the future itself.
Sweet love, mad scientist.
Yes, but this is the future, remember?
No you can't do that, this is only gonna make things worse.
Well then maybe we should go back in time and see what happened to the first man and woman.
Then we're not gonna understand one bit.
I don't understand at all.
I will. I will outwit you right now. I'm gonna take the first man and woman back to the future.
So mad scientist, I mean mad scientist.
So I'm just gonna take the first man and woman back to the future.
So?
So what do we do now?
Okay, that's good.
Okay, that's good.
But what happens if there is one single girl?
...I don't suppose you mean the one girl?
I mean, there is nothing we can do except wait until the very last minute.
Okay.
But what happens if there is only one man?
What would Jesus say?
Butters, there is only one way we know. Jesus would give us something to cheer us up.
Jesus told us to trust him. Now we have to do something.
Kyle, you've gotta help us find the perfect mirror for the school football team.
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Yeah. What's the big deal?
? Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Well, we can't just let somebody at the airport fuck us again. We have to find a way to get back at the terrorists!
I know.
Come on, we've gotta get to the mall now.
 mallprotectingme.com
Yeah, but can they?
Jesus Christ. This is hopeless.
Oh my God.
Dude, we've gotta get something to shoot.
Come on, guys. We've gotta get something to shoot mallprotectingme.
Yeah, like Ikebukuro!
He was the best player in the country!
Come on, Kyle!
You guys! Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle, you can't read this!
The mall manager said to us last night: you people are too busy to read this!
We have to
====================
Uncle Jimbo, I have a question. What's the matter?
Aunt Flo, where'd you get a biiiiig?
You mean, the one and only time you???
Whoa!
You got it! Your DNA is on the cross!
Dude, Jesus is on the cross, and then you got crucified!
But everyone else in the faith, Jesus has died, come to live on in hell, and your soul is gone.
I don't know what to do, dude. I, I mean, Jesus was never gonna die on the cross, and I was never gonna die on the cross for love.
Okay, here we go.
Kyle, this is hopeless.
We have to promise not to say more nudity in class tomorrow.
Mom, if we keep quiet, we'll signal that the beginning of class is almost upon us.
All right.
Okay, let's see: Muhammad Ali, we're gonna be at large Fairbanks in three days.
Will you just stop and think about it?
Can't you just say "no" to the whole thing?
All right, fine.
Okay, let's see. Jesus saying "no" to Muhammad Ali's entire thing. Will you just stop and think about it?
...Wow.
Kenny? Kenny, what the hell?
What?
Kenny, there's a huge difference between this and the movie God.
Oh no, what now?
Hey God!
I guess, based on what I've seen, I'm gonna have to say whatever I can to get Kenny's expulsion dropped.
Okay, so how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Garment's ass?
See? That's what happened to me!
That's what they made me think, too!
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
What?
But are you blind, Dude? You can't see?
That's a really good idea.
Dude, I think the fat lady is.
What is that?
Dude, what the hell?
What are you guys doing?
Hey Gary, how come you never said "no" to the whole thing?
Dude, I don't even like the way your parents treated me.
Mom, I don't get it.
====================
So... uh, you wanna come play catch with us?
We've got a lot of things we wanna ask you to do, but we also, we don't wanna just hand you a bunch of money.
I know!
Awww!
Huh?
Yeah, well, so is your uncle Jimbo.
Oh, hey, how's it going?
Yeah, well, you don't know anything about finance or magic tricks, so uh, can I join you for a bean-licking?
I wanna try and woo Kyle to my house.
Dude, I can't!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle, what are you talking about?
Kyle. You guys are so full of shit!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle!... Worshipful Spirit?
What's going on?!
I don't know, meh, maybe we should just go home.
Eheh, my god.
Kyle!
He's my best friend ever
I mean, he's still alive.
Whoa!
Dude, he's pretty cool, too.
Whoa, dude, dude, don't be such a Christbot!
Kyle, you have to keep playing the rock bottom!
Hurry up, you guys!
Dude, you're not going to listen to us!
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
Cartman, stop!
The stick figure?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Dude, I don't get it.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What's the problem?
Uh, we're sorry, but our client is really bad.
No, he or she doesn't.
We'll have our own room, please.
Mr. Garrison is being very nice to us.
He's a dick, he's a dick, he's a dick, he's a dick, he wants to ruin it for us by sticking his dick in ours, okay?
Are you sure?
Dude, we're gonna tell Cartman to get out of here, okay?
Truth or Dare?
Don't you see, Kyle? Kenny is only three years old at the time of this writing.
Yeah, whatever, dude.
You're so gonna charge
====================
Don't you see, Kyle? I know what you all thought: she could've just left it at that.  But I don't want it to become an untenable situation for any other reason.
I don't want anybody knowing what happened that first night in school.
...Uncle Jimbo, I have a report on what happened in Denver on WBC. You are supposed to be watching that show, not Dad's or Bobby's house.
You guys, I think we have to watch it.
Look, it sucks ass, Mom and Dad.
But Dad, you made us all laugh.
Yeah, right!
Cartman, remember this?
If you want to be in a fight with Wendy, you have to out-talk her.
Mom, up with the X's and O's, for what purpose?
Sso, then so be it.
Slyther?
If only there were one thing we knew: she was trapped in this big, black, hardback.
What's going on? Cartman! You've got to be kidding!
What is that?
Hey, what's the Black Death?
Dude, come on, guys.
Yyeah.  Hey, what's the Black Death?
Come on, Kyle!
Aw, crap.
How come they have Cartman in the bathtub with me?
Cartman, you stupid sponge!
What
They don't have a bathtub, Kyle.
Why does that matter?
Kyle, we're talking about a book!
That's great, dude.
We're going to the big fight of Ultimate Frisbee!
Dude, we don't need a book.
Just keep reading.
All right.
...Well, it's not really a big deal. We'll just read it and laugh it off.
I don't understand.
Oh... Well, anyway, this is ridiculous.
It's just a stupid commercial, dude.
All right. Then think about it:
What would a reaction be if a child were to one of these books and one of us were to fall under its spell?
The other book is a record of the Native Americans' lives, and it has something to do with Jesus' death.
That's true.
No, that's just wrong, dude. If you want to make a living, you have to
====================
I'll prove it.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Mom, Dad are you still asleep?
That's it, Butters? Timmy's gonna be back in Orange County by the boat.
We just have to go in there and get him.
I dunno. Timmy, he'll be back in Orange County in about 20 hours.
Oh my God. Kenny!
Timmy, you can't go in there.  Chef, you have to go in there.  Period.
Okay, here we go.
It's a save, dude.
No, he's not.
Sick, dude, I think he's really sick.
Okay,here we go.
Hey, hey, screw this!
Guys, guys, guys, we are cut and done.
We're not playing, not on Christmas.
You guys, guys! Look!  It's a Christmas trick!
Snowball!
We don't wanna whack him, are we?
That's right.  Dude, not cool!
Dude, sleutha meanin' to bust into our house and take our Christmas spirit.
We've got a lot of questions we wanna ask ourselves...
What is the secret of Christmas?
We've been trying to get to the bottom of this for a while.
But what is it really we're trying to understand?
SEEKERS?
...A sea snake.
Dude, is that from Aliens?
Yeah, just the news was awesome!
So what is the secret of Christmas?
Yeah, the movie sucked!
Why do people keep telling us the Easter Bunny story?
Butters, are you using stale scare humor?
Where is the video?
Yeah, well, if you wanna be in Cartman's shoes, you can't go to the mall.
What is the mall about?
Whoa, dude!
Butters, I think you're pretty cool.
Where's Bobby Flay, right?
What is the movie about?
...Kenny?  What the hell is he?
Kyle, don't be such a pussy!
Dude, I'm going to the mall to buy a pumpkin patch.
What?
Whoa, dude!
That's not what the mall was about, Kyle!
Dude, I don't think that's cool.
====================
Dad! Dad!
Alright, my friend and I are gonna coach you guys on how to best fight for our country.
Oh no.
Dude, where's our lunch? It's either fight or learn to fight.
Chickenpo--?
Alright, I'm going over to his house.
Dad, where's our lesson?
Yeah, he's fighting Chef last night.
Yeah, he wants to do something worse and Chef wants to do something better than eat, too.
Well, we'll just keep going. We're gonna coach you and you'll help ourselves to french fries.
Well?
Oh, thank God.
We're not doing it, you fat bitch!
Let's just keep going, mayor.
Oh God-dammit!
We're not leaving until you order a "fries" and "fries" and a "snow-fries" and a "snow-fries."
Oh no!
Mr. Garrison, you need to go get our brochure.
Get the suitcases we're on. There might be something here.
We made it!
Come on, they gotta return them.
Did you bring them back?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Did you bring us back your brochure?
They've already done it.
You made it, fat ass!
We've got a suitcase full of starving reporters!
Of course we do! First they have to be produced, and then we can't you just leave us here.
You what?!
Dude, we've just gotta make a living! Do you think we can do it?
What the hell is the big deal?!
We have to make a living!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
How come you wanna die, Mayor?
No, it doesn't matter. We're just gonna start a new movement, and then people will stop exploiting and killing little girls like we knew.
You're not?
Dude, that's not Harley's boobs!
Yeah, that's Ike Broflovski's T-shirt.
What's the big deal?
Getting people to stop using T-shirts is gonna be soooooo easy. People will just move away and we don't care.
What is the big deal?
? Oh God, they've killed Kenny!
No...

====================
Cartman, stop trying to rip on me! You're our friend; now let's go!
We're not being sarcastic, dude!  That was a long time ago, dude! It was a long time ago, and Cartman is not the same person he was in the movie.
He's, he was our friend in the movie, and now he's trying to downplay that movie's bad guy status by saying, "The thing is with Cartman."
Look, maybe, really, maybe there's no way for us to all be the same.
No, dude, all the guys who are trapped on their roofs are just as bad as you are.
Cartman, can you move up?
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus, dude!
Hey Kyle.
Kyle, there's like a thousand people trapped on your roof. Can you move up?
Kyle, that is awesome! We had to move up!
Fancy a try?
What are you doing, clone?
We had a-
Dude, what are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
It is a miracle!
There was a time... when everything worked itself out, and then people got angry at each other and started to destroy themselves.  But it was all a trick to get people to move away from us. There was never a chance we could all hang out and laugh about the whole thing.
Beside, maybe people are still gonna get pissed off at us for not moving up and, maybe the clone people are actually gonna be more pissed off at us for not moving up.
...Yeah, dude, it's kinda weird.
There was a time, when everything worked itself out and then everything went back to normal. Then it was just you and your friends. Now everything is just fun and variations are great.
I, I guess.
Dude, clone people... what kind of parents are we?
That's not cool.
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know. The future is a depressing, scary, and scary lot like the past.
You're gonna have to go look outside your crazy shoebox to find out what that device means.
The future is pretty scary, you know.
Maybe we should go look in the closet.
Cartman's not gonna tell on us now. We have to find something
====================
Mr. Garrison, what happened? Doesn't anyone believe him?
He's just waking up.
You guys, check this out: During the third act of the newscast, Kenny said something about the first act was like his best show.
That's not true, Garrison. The second act is just fine without Kenny.
Kenny?  Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Where are you going?
But... But where are you going, Chef?
Oh.
You don't understand. Just because somebody is intelligent doesn't mean they are good people.
Wow, couldn't you just ask them to do something really interesting?
Well, we're just gonna have to ask them: what's the most romantic thing you could think?
We can't wait.
It's a long shot, dude.
Hey, it's Oscar for us.
You know what they say?
No.
But Macklemore and I are gonna be busting new grounders tomorrow, so let's just keep going.
You got busting new grounders, Cartman?
Wow, that's amazing.
Uh-oh.
That's okay, Chef, we'll just keep going.
How come you want to bust new grounders, Chef? I was.
Oh, hey, Cartman found a go-cart and's driving it wrong.
Uh-oh.
You found a go-cart and's driving it wrong.
Oh!
Go-bop and go-bops!
We're going stupid fast, fatass!
Huh-I don't know.
Cartman?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Where are you going?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Guys, guys, have you found the perfect private jet for you?
Yes, we do. We'll fly you to Los Angeles!
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
You found a go-cart and's driving it wrong.
Okay, so what are we gonna do?
Just keep going, Cartman.
Come on, it's all about the brakes.
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
What?
Sit still, George Clooney.
Shut up, Cartman.
Oh, nice going, George Clooney.
You didn't know that, Dad
====================
Hey I'm back in time!  Uh, what did that look like?
Yeah, the first grader?
What's that?
Cartman, you gotta tell me the secret to the fifth grade leprechaun?
But why?
It's all a scam!
Mr. Garrison's authorizations have been suspended.
You completely betrayed the last bit of hope I had for you!
Well then, I'll just tell the election to be all about us versus you!
Hundred dollar gift certificate for best selling four CDs!
Well, I won't have that. I... I don't want it.
Okay.
Uh, Butters, I'm sorry. I thought we were friends.
I do?
I don't know.
One of the most treasured possessions of the homeless is now out of reach of police!
Yeah, it's awesome. I look forward to taking pictures of Kyle and David down the toilet.
Hey uh, I saw your book last night, Kyle.
How's it going, Cartman?
Cartman, it's a long shot.
Dude, how are we supposed to know if your friend Pinhead has SWEET DADT?
To prevent future accidents, the school bus will be in service again on Saturday, March 4th.
Huh?
Timecist?
So?
Dude, can you tell we're not dead?
So? That's good.
Dude, we have to do something. This is about you and Timmy.
Who?
...Wait. You mean...
Wait, they have Timmy in class tomorrow?
He's dead!
We're going to see Charlie Brown in the swimming pool!
Where's the big party yet?
Dude, do you really I have to go with that?
Sally Struthers is being investigated for child porn.
What?
I don't believe it.
No.
Dad, I'm scared.
Yeah, my dad's gonna kill me.
So?
Dude, are you still scared after being in a lot of self-harming?
How do you feel? I guess we can't go to the big party again.
I guess we have to do something. This whole time we've been getting peer attention for being so nervous.
Come on, let's go!

====================
This is gonna be so sweet, babe.
How's it going, Cartman?
Come on, Kenny's in trouble!
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Tor- torture you?
We don't want to torture you.
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet!
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny?
All right, let's get the hell out of here!
Aah! Run, dude, run!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-
Yeah. I told you that!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad
====================
to try to stop the evil forces that are trying to destroy us all.
I don't wanna be a slave to Cartman's idea! I wanna be a free ManBearPig!
Well one day, maybe I won't have to fight anymore than any of you do. 
And what will you do when all is said and done?
I am assigned to Detachment Kenny. 
Detachment Kyle, I am sorry to interrupt, but my job is to keep the door locked on the first coming, so-- God damnit!
What?
Well what do you mean God damnit?
Well, I, I don't really care about the TV show, so I am not interested in the whole thing.
Well sure, you can say what you want about it, but I don't think it's in the public's interest.
Well said, Mr. Garrison. 
Yeah, good job, Cartman! 
Well, what does that have to do with Bobby Jindal?
Well, I mean, look at what the people of Louisiana have become. A state that voted Republican in the General Assembly elections of '15. Now, that's a lot of change. But it's also a lot of change.
It's very difficult to change a state that voted Republican.
Very well, the League of Women Voters of Louisiana hereby change their voting system.
I hope our new friend President Obama is doing the shopping spree.
Oh, stop! That's too extreme!
Butters, just keep your mouth shut.
Hey, look at what the guys are doing to our state.
Yeah, back in those first few days.
When were we not old enough to vote? 
Okay, here we go.
I like it.
Voting isn't about being good to one another anymore; it's about being good to them, too.
Easy.
Okay.
Oh, stop, Mom! 
Butters, you can't do that! These guys are doing their best to get as many people as possible to the polls. 
Okay, we'll do the math, dude. If I vote for them, they'll be the first one to put me in the driver's seat. Butters, you said that when the voting booths opened that day that we were gonna get a digital vote. A metal one
====================
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
I don't know what to do dude, my dad's a--.
Yeah.
Hey, where have you been?
What?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Whoa whoa whoa, wait, wait, wait. ...where's Booth-san?
Ugh, I'm hungry too.
Hey, you guys! You guys! Where are you and where are you're going?!
B-b-but, I'm just a-scared of snakes.
B-but, I just wanted to tell you something. When I first got sucked into the business, I didn't think everything was so scary. Now, I see why some people are into it, but I'm the exception, not the rule.
Dude, I don't think any of us have the same responsibilities as other people, you guys. If Cartman can just be Kenny's slave, like all his friends are, then, my dad will be doing the talking for the first time.
Hey, you guys!
Dude, we're not being watched!
Hey, come on, guys!  Is that the only time you have pictures of your little brother kissing people?
Huh?
Wugh, I don't know.
Dude, if you guys don't come back, I'm sure as hell gonna kick your ass.
I'm not the only kid in school who's had their teacher see through it.
Cool!
Cool!
Yeah, when did you get that idea, Dad?
...Huh??
Oh, no.
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday.
Dude, dude, we'd have to be at the mall to buy tickets.
Oh, hey guys. Looks like we have a chance to present our new best friend, underwear.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude!
Kyle, you're not gonna believe what happened last night!
Where were you guys were sittin' at uh, baby?
Parents... can act like they're cool now.
What?
But what can they do?
Save on kid gloves?
Save on all the stupid stuff?
Save on all those lawsuits?
Save on all that stupid stuff?
Save on all that stupid stuff?
Where's your stuff, fat boy
====================
It was just a show.
Dude, I don't get it. This guy wants to start a fight.
Mom, will you put on ladies' clothes?
Come on, let's go home.
What?
I don't get it. This guy wants to start a fight.
No, I don't get it. This guy wants to start a fight.
Thanks.
Where the hell are you going?
...So what are you going to do now that you've been through so much?
You have to just come out of your shell and see that the trophy's for real.
Whoa, dude!
Kyle, you've been through a lot like this guy, Craig, and you're gonna tell me that's not the case?
Not at all. What really happens is that when Kyle and Craig get to the bottom of this, they find it impossible to hit 90.
It doesn't matter if you're a slob or not. There's something much more important at stake here.
Cartman wants to beat you up, dude.  Ever since he saw the news the first time wept.
You got what you deserved, dude. We'll take it, dude.
It was-
We got what we wanted, dude.
Butters!
Butters, we're gonna Tweek Kenny!
The bus will be here any minute, and we have the Orville Egg!
What the hell's going on?!
Excuse me.
It's basically the whole egg package. We've been framed.
What the hell was that?
I think Cartman might actually be in jail.
Dude, it's really strange.
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude, dude!
Dude, it's Saturday!
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Well, we can't just let that stupid lottery company keep on keeping hold our kids.
Yeah, they'll try to too.
We can't let them do it, dude.
Will you take Pay Pal back from that stupid lottery company?
KYLE!!
Hello?
We're the ones who got Kenny's egg; we have nothing to lose.
We worked miracles, bro!
Hey hey!
We've gotta get back to the egg package thing!
It's some old TV, or something.
Jesus Christ!
Hey Kenny
====================
I guess I'll have to wait for Wendy, Dad.
Wait, woodland critters...
Yeah, I know!
Beside, maybe they just don't have the strength to take Kyle down.
But I have to win this war! I want the bread!
Oh, boy!  The last bastion of Christian-Crusader boy-worship!  Ahh!
Uh, I'll throw in ten,000 students!
Agh.  What the hell?
What?
For a day? Oh, dude, they've killed Kenny!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. I learned something today. I used the old saying, "A wise person looks for wisdom in men," and I'm not talking about the movies. I never said, "You have to be a good look in the eyes to be a Christian," I was just talking about the old saying, "good looks can cure a lot of diseases."
Look, all things considered, Christian Reconstructionism is a lot like my dad's philosophy was. Jesus was crucified for you, Jesus. Dibs off.
For what?
No, dude, dude, listen, the point is that you all have the power over this guy.
Yes, dude. That's all you have to do.
Okay.
Jesus??
What the hell is going on?!
Wait, woodland critters...
They got to our house last night!
What?
Kyle, what happened?
Where did you get those critters?
They took them to the hospital.
They just got better.
They've been taken to the hospital.
They don't wanna talk, don't wanna talk.
We just wanna know what's going on down there.
Dr. Mephesto is trying to say what he said before.
...Well, I guess... I don't know.
Come on, let's go get the critters.  I think we know where they are.
Alright, let's go.
...Well, look, Kyle.  It might be best if we... just destroy the goat.
But Kyle, at least we have our lunch.
Okay, here we go.
Yeah, well... I might need those if we have to.
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
This is hopeless.
====================
The whole town is pissed off at the corporate school that doesn't promise anything, and they want everyone to become academies for realignment.
Yeah, so then, how about we do something a little different? We could... teach our kids in the morning and then...--we'll raise their eyebrows.
Uh, we'd love to.
You mean, you just- here, utensil.io?
Of course! If we don't get our eyebrows raised, the corporate school will put us in the same stupid pile as many fugitives.
Our friends are still trapped in Peru.
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing, pig?!
Sure, dude, we'll help you. Hurry up fast!
It's a takeoff, glory!
Oh my God! Look!
 Eagle-tailed deer!
Yeah, Cartman, damn you!
Oh, hey Butters.
Well it's just a boy's pee, remember?
Well, it's not like everyone in the country is newbie or anything like that.
Oh uh, and here's what pee looks like to a pig
So what should we do?
We have to teach our rally at lunch?
Come on, Kyle! We've gotta know our mom first!
All right, come on, there's gotta be somethin' about this!
First of all, it's gotta be true. All the guys I went to wrestling camp with that were lying.
And then there's the fact that no, there's not.
No, you're not being very nice to my mom.
Yeah, when does Taylor Swift become?
Scott Weiland?
Uh, hey.
How come you wanna be on the wrestling team?
Coach, do you wanna come be on the wrestling team?
Then we're gonna have to ask you: Why do so many people give you no pleasure?
Fornication? It isn't a sin.
No, it's an old principle. Adam Sandler said it was over. He meant he didn't like anybody.
What's a Mr. McMahon?
Butters.
Dude, I think we all love our jobs.
Yeah, but we'd better not let it ruin our life.
What's going on?
Oh, hey Dad.
Yeah, but we just wanted to tell you: We think being in a wrestling ring
====================
Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?
We have a negotiator here named Nancy. She said that the school gave us a bunch of money.
Uh, well, so is your school.
No, it's the Hunger Games. Peru, c'est-you see, isn't it, Team Half-step?
Yeah, I remember seeing a movie once where they fucked off and played Legos until you got the hang of it.
Nah, I saw it on YouToob.
Pretty cool.
Yeah, I wonder why Cartman got into this.
Well, come on guys. If Half-D has any hope of stopping him, it's this... toy store.
Uh, they have Takamu in a special pink plastic bag.
No, no, we've just gotta get this thing away from the kids.
Pretty good.
Kenny?!  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!
Kenny?!  I brought them!
The government came and got rid of you.  They're here!
Come on, we've gotta get out!
We have to get this thing away from the kids, or else we're gonna find it!
Just get the thing away from the kids and control it!
We've gotta keep this thing in the right spot.
Hey, it's that robot named Ike!
Yeah, don't worry. A bunch of kids are gonna be pissed off at us.
Yeah, we made them into a movie.
Pretty cool.
Hey, hey, you guys. Did you bring the movie?
The guys are pirates in a war?
We played a game?
That's pretty sure.
What are you talking about?
I don't know,  I don't like it.  Is this what you're looking for?
What?
So- who is this other side to the war?
I don't know.
Did you get to any money?
You just asked them to, are you guys?
Yeah, I guess so. What about our money?
Dude, that's our money.
Wow, we got great entertainment last night. Cheap dancing, John Elway!
Chef, we're gonna buy some more tickets.
Sorry, $10 off of any ticket.
What are you talking about?
U
====================
Our problem isn't with the iPod, it's with it.
Sure, dude, we'll look into it.
But the point is that if we have to use our cellphones at all, it's because we didn't set out to shoot the bitch.
That's true.
Well what about the point?
Well, isn't it at stake?
What choice do we have?
Look, uh... We can't let Wendy go unrepresented.  If Kyle beats us up again, I think we have reason to believe that the gangs that protected the streets in the '60s and '70s will be gone forever ago.
Or maybe the bad guys won't be here any time soon.
This is all so crazy
Pizza... pizza...
We always wondered if this was a good time for us to start having child-rap music videos.
Yeah, we should be doing our own melodic section soon.
Dude, what a bunch of homophobes.
We shouldn't be making child-rap music videos, you stupid asshole!
Woof.
Dude, why are you so into their new album?
What's the stupidest thing we've heard them say about us?
Yeah, we're not normal kids!
Dude, we have to make music videos now!
Jesus Christ, are you so insane we can't believe these lambs were spared?
That's fine, Wendy, we'll study, we'll get some CDs, and then we'll go see the animals they sacrificed at Mount Sinai.
We're gonna make music videos that people are gonna buy at Wal-Mart.
We'll see what Wal-Mart guys think.
Oh, boy. Look, guys. You've gotta make something *wink* people second- guess what's going on.
Look, they sacrificed three billion dollars worth of animal products at an&m.
Yeah, dude. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Come on, Kenny, we're gonna need some old stuff.
We have to get this ape back for us.
He was our friend.
We want a picture of Kenny with our uncle Jimbo.
He'd better!
Kenny woulda done the same!
Kenny!
Dude, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, Kenny! What the hell happened?!
====================
The House of Hades is located just outside of town. If the hibiscus people can get to the House of Hades, then it will be impossible for them to kill Cartman.
If the House of Hibiscus people can get to the House of Humbiscus, then it will be an easy win for the House of Hades.
The House of Hibernaeus is now you.
The House of Humbureted Wrath.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Damn it!
But the house is too big, and the hibiscus people will have to move it all up.
Oh right. Now let's just watch.
The House of Hell-Erected Manipulation.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
Yeah?!
Dude, what are you going to do if you don't get out of here?
What?
What do you mean?
Alright, here.
Alright, everyone.  Take everything out of context.
I don't think it's fair for the House of Hell-Erected Manipulation to be able to grab all our power over the world and use it for their own ends, all because Cartman wasn't smart enough to go along with it.
...Well, in that moment, all of a sudden, you have to be really mean to get us to stop doing stupid stuff.
...Hoohh, like Shakespeare.
Is that the only form in?
Alright, that's good.
Well, I guess we can't get back at him.  He's still in the hospital.
Ah, anesthetic?
Yeah, they know what it is.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute.
How, ma'am.
Ma'am, did you guys get the memo?
Do you still think that way, ma'am?
Go ahead and remove his eyes, asshole!
Okay.
Okay, Mr. Mackey, let's remove his chins.
Okay, that'll do it.
Butters, listen.  It's the head ninja.  Swipe left, three seconds.
Cartman, you've got to be kidding me! I think you really want this job, asshole!
Huh?
Dude, I don
====================
A great deal of our anger was directed at the celebrity chef.
But Grandpa, you need to take a stand and tell him to go fuck himself.
Stop it!
Superhot!
We can't let them do it, dude.  We have to make amends.
We just can't won anymore than he was.
He's too famous. For one thing, he's worth hundreds of millions.
He's too rich to be bottomless.
No, you just lost this argument!  The way he's being treated now, this is never gonna be the way it is in the future.
Yeah, fine, thanks a lot.  I guess we can't get back at him.
I don't know.
Kyle, maybe you should do the same thing we did. Show the world what Paul Konerko did to you.
Fuck you, Cartman!
What the hell is he talking about?
Fuck you, Cartman! You asshole!
Look, guys, we know how it is now. But, but this is definitely not the future.
Look, maybe, just maybe, you can just stop pandering and become a better chef.
With less pain, more pleasure!
No, I exaggerate a lot.
The pain is not that great, of course. It's just that the future doesn't seem so terrible anymore.
But what about the price of chicken? Right now, $1 chicken is $167.  But if we atechef will-o-nine-nine, tomorrow we have to try to satiate our appetites a little bit.
Will you just close your eyes and eat cake?
Okay, fine, Wendy.  Good night, Wendy.
Oh, I'm not asleep, Kyle.
Uh, can I ask you a big favor?
What's a dildo?
Alright, come on, guys.
You're gonna build a dam and then we'll go play in the dam.
Dude, you're the one who did that with Stan.
Dude, just let me get this straight: You have no idea what this device is about. It's like there's a prize for saying "DAD!"
Well, guess what? We can try to stop Token and Kenny now.
You're gonna be all right.
Just, just a little.
Okay, that, that's
====================
It's time for some action!
Let's get Mr. Mackey back, or else!
Action! Mr. Mackey is trapped in the mall! He's gotta get out!
What the hell happened here?
This is gonna be so funny!
We all love Action Mom!
No, you're a fatter version of Peter.
Action Jackson would've said that!
Wendy, there's more action in the mall now.
There isn't!
There was aaaaaagh!  It's like they finally got it.
There were no more fives, okay?
It was horrible! And it just showed up on TV.
Tomorrow?  We have to see Action Mom in the mall.
He's just confused.
How can they do that??
Action Mom?
He must have the answer, because Winkie and Cartman got their jobs.
Yes, they do.
Wendy, we have to see him in the mall.
He looks pretty good, dude.
Wendy, we have to see!
Wendy, look!
There he is, about to go up and oh-!
Wendy, look!
Cartman, look!
Wendy, look!
Wendy, look!
Oh, boy! It's Action Mom!
Yeah, you're supposed to be watching Mom, not doing homework!
Wendy, look!
Action!
That's Cartman!
Wendy, look!
That's Cartman, hanging out with the guys.
Yeah, I wonder if that means Mom and Cartman can get back together for the big dance.
Huh?
Dude, are you guys working on that one?
That up there. You know, maybe it does count.
I don't know.
Come on, guys, we have to watch that movie.
Yeah, why don't you guys just pretend not to notice anything?
Yeah. Wait, what?
Wait, dolphins are intelligent?
What, like David Blaine's book?
Dude, we can't watch it. We'd be dumb enough to not pick it.
Oh man, dolphins are intelligent.
No! 
So, after watching Action Mom for a while, I finally came to the stupid thing.
What?
I don't believe it.
====================
I don't get it.
Yeah, Cartman said he wanted to do the same thing for Harley.
Huh? What's that?
What's the High School Musical?
Yeah, I've never heard of that name.
I don't know.
Mom, Harley doesn't have a Thumb-e-Called Number.
No, that's a cool idea!
Why don't you guys just tell your parents?
Mom, you guys can stop worrying! We can all just forget about it!
Kyle, you know what happens when you ignore the bad guys and just go about your day? You become a figurehead for some crazy cult that wants to take your friends on foreign adventures.
Yeah, you've never seen Godot, Kyle.
How do you avoid becoming a figurehead like the Super Best Friends do?
Well, I'm not the biggest douche, but... I'm not the biggest asshole for that matter.
I mean, I might be better than your average Jared Pilgrim, but I'm not gonna take the s--t off of my friend!
Kyle. Look, dude. Godot.org makes about $10 in a commercial.
Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, look!
Aw, dude, that's our friend!
Dude, he's doing really funny now.
He's got a big clump of friends over at Godot.
"Friend," Kyle says, and they make a show of getting into the faces of all those Middle Easterners they want to harm you.
"Friend," I say.
No thanks. Godot takes care of the bad guys.
Okay, so howdy do you guys, gangs.
Hey, you guys! Check out these cars.
Hey, hey, look at what these terrorists are doing.
Yeah, yeah, we all want to do the same thing.
But look at what we did.
Yeah, we all want to do something pretty bad and evil today.
A bunch of pissed-off Muslims storm a bus, and are followed by Christian Gothies.
Well, what do you do?
Aw, shit.
What do you think, guys?
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the first one yet.
Oh, shit.
Jesus Christ!
Butters, listen. There's gotta be something going on
====================
Hey!  Wait a minute!
Yeah dude, at least I met Sparky.
What's he say?
Sick Sparky.
Uhhh what?
Hey Spark, what are you doing?!
What's goin' on?
Hey Sparky, the light turns red!
Look. I pulled over in the traffic, and the light turned red before I could go any further, right?
Sparky, stop it!
Yeah, uh if I don't go faster, somebody else will!
Wow, my buddy MarkBernstein is actually from here.
So I pulled over, just the traffic light turning red. What's the big deal?
What do you mean?
It was supposed to be me, but the dickdriving public got its freak ticket from the douche.
Sick, Sparky! You fall down!
Oh my God! They've killed Sparky!
Oh, no! They can't!
They did! They can't do anything.
Huh?  Oh, sparky, I think we're alone.
Trickery?
Uh huh, but there's nothing we can do.
We'd love to, but we have to work for it!
Nobody's gonna give us a second crap about stuff that's never happened!
Who?
Yeah, we don't need nobody to tell us what to do!
What are you talking about?
That's so sad.
Yeah, I know.
Cartman, why are you so into pyramids?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah, but what if we have a plan?
If we work together, we can actually make things go faster.
That up there! That seems like a good idea.
Dude, not to go to that stupid party.
Mom, I'm getting on that plane.
Chef, how can we get on?
I just want you to be proud of me for liking these things so much.
No, I I I don't think that's right. I wish somebody else would have done it.
That'd be great.
But what about them?
I like the look of them.
But then why are you so into them?
Then why are you so into them?
Then why are you so into them?
So why are you so into them?
...I don
====================
I can't believe they're still alive. What does that mean?
Or is that just the hypnosis?
Or is this just a way for people to make money?
Hi, can I ask a question? What do you mean by "money"?
Well, do you think people are actually gonna buy this PS4 and not listen to music?
Yeah, like, listen to that old marihuana band!
Yeah, so you're just glad that old people are okay now.
You guys! It's, it's, it's online shopping.
It's not that big a deal.
Oh, hey guys. In-game, are we supposed to register an account or not?
My dad is working on his game.
What?
What?!
But you guys! You guys, we are running a Scouts camp in Colorado!
Oh shit!
What is that?
We need Scouts to help kids like yours become Scouts.
Yeah, it's big trouble.
...What?
Yeah, dude, we could get in trouble.
We in the Scouts!
Jesus Christ, Dude, what's wrong with you guys?
No, dude, we're not in trouble.
What?
Oh, hey Cartman. In Colorado you can get a sniper rifle.
You guys, Cartman is holed up in a bunker. He's not gonna let you out,  so you have to stay there for a while.
Okay, here we go.
Yeah, that's pretty cool, dude.
Okay, here we go.
It... its the right way.
Snowballing is fun, Butters.
Dude, not being in a sport that lets you be the leader, that's not in the game.
Yes, dude. If Butters is number seven, then is he?
God-dammit, what's wrong with that guy?
Yeah, verify!
All right, it looks like Cartman's been frozen 32 million years.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh my God.
We're done with Scouts!
We can't do it without them now!
Hey, guys.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, dude, that's not in the game at all.
I don't know about you, but... I think there's a way...
...Free
====================
Wow! Hey guys!  It's Kenny!
Yeah, he still hasn't come out of his tough time.
Yeah dude, but this is gonna be awesome!
Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
Hey, I didn't throw up.
I'm gonna have to see if my sister is watching.
Sshh! Be quit. We could all go home.
Kenny's ne'er do well.
Yes, and I'm gonna buy fireworks.
Ah, I think we're gonna send one of your fireworks over South Park.
What?
I don't know, meh, I might need it.
What are you going to do, dad?
No, meh not!
Kyle, you have to make friends with the kids from South Park!
Dude, I don't understand at all. You're just trying to make a point!
Look, these things are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars!  This is just a great way to scare the fifth graders.
Mom, Dad, I don't get it.
Oh my God! Ultron?!
Hey!  Look, my dad's saying that somebody in your family can now become super-villainous.
Well, you know, somebody who becomes super-villainous and then you give him everything, right? That's what I think I wanted.
Like... see?
Get the fuck out of here.
He's not mine.  All this money, his soul is... stolen.
What?
Yeah, he looks terrible.
Hey, who-you guy zetas, don't be so sure. I think they both have superpowers.
Dude, it's like you're supposed to be watching all these people from the show, but differently qualified to step foot in your new home?
Come on, Craig, about the rent?
It's just a stupid list, Craig. We're just gonna have to go in there and get our money's worth.
Hey, Token. How come they're taking you places like this?
Yeah, like, meet me at the bus stop. Why don't you tell me what I did wrong?
Sshh!
I don't know, just...
Token, how should I describe your-
pa?
...Very few people get that far.
Look, Token,
====================
Hi! I'm Park Hyou-san. I was the leader of the South Park Five, then-
I'm not a fudge packer, I swear.
What?
But what does that mean?
Uh, no problem.
Alright, where's Yo-Yo!
'Scuse me, my name is-
Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
Dude, I don't know how you could say that between people you know and people you don't know.
...So what I'm gonna do is I'll show you a picture of my-
Wow, did you guys get-
No, dude, not even close. See?
I'll show you. I literally got like, fifty yards in a row when Cartman got crucified.
...What?
Jesus Christ, dude!
How can you say that between people you don't know?
Ugh.
But it's just shit, dude. I'll show you. I just didn't mean it.
How many more seconds?
Oh, fool, we're gonna be late for the new year!
You can't be serious!
Hey, man. Avengers: Age of Ultron?
Dude, we don't wanna watch anything else's shows.
It's not even the two of us!
Oh, dude, why would anyone do that?
Do you think they're good people?
Come on, we've gotta help them if we're to win the new year!
Hey, kid, how come you took the picture?
Wait! Wait, they're still in the audience!  Dude, they happened to be standing by that day!
Well, maybe you were right. Maybe the stage was a-rushed after all.
Uh, can I take this to the police?
(Sound effects? That's what helicopters are for!)
Thetan levels...
Are you bringing this to the police?
They... don't have time to bring it back.
Alright, it's time to start the new year with a bang. We need good footage of the new year, and then we can go do the costumes for the new stadium. Could you... make a room in the back so we can't get in?
Hey, you guys!  Is your room filling up?
Well then maybe we should just get out of here
====================
She's the witch Celia Stritch, and yet another fatass trying to please her own sex slaves.
But why? Why does a fifth grader have to wear bunny ears to school?
And what is the secret of Easter to them?
Yeah, this is stupid.
This is stupid. They're just messing around.
What's the big deal?
Yeah, you know, you guys should know one thing: I've been in Afghanistan and nobody has ever killed a zombie.
I don't wanna bury my head in the sand, bro. I mean, Afghanistan isn't that dangerous, okay?
All I know is that for some reason the other team is gonna play football, and I'm gonna go where I want.
All right, that's Afghanistan!  Where Afghanistan!
All right, I'm gonna go and support the team that goes to Afghanistan.
All right, I'm gonna go and support the team that goes to Afghanistan.
So all right, I'm gonna go and support the team that goes to Afghanistan.
What?
Yeah, dude, that's like it never happened.
No way!
But what does that mean?
Dude, this is so fucked up!
They can't just let that guy keep getting better.
Why does that matter?
So how should we split up?
Hey, Tweek, how would you like to split up?
Huh-axl!
For what?
Yeah, dude, when the Japanese crime wave hit, they released X-rays all over the country.
And X-rays show that Cartman's ass is still up and down.
Yeah, dude. They should have never releasing that stuff to the public.
Hey, Tweek, you have to keep picking on that Japanese guy.
You do?
Yeah, dude. We should. Maybe, just maybe, the whole world is at stake here.
All right.
Well, come on, do you just- gonna-
Tweek?
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman's alive!
So he can't just be gotten away with playing the alien Candyman!
Dude, just let us get away from here.
What the hell does that mean?
A lot of things do.
Yeah.
Cartman's gonna hell.
That'd be sweet.
Oh, hey Dad. How are
====================
So what do you think?
Do you think he'll be in the movies?
Oh, of course!
You're right. Well now, how about this:  Aaaaahh!
The lion cubs!
Governor Bebe is undercover as a police captain!
Oh my God! Look!
Tammy, are those police cubs from China?
They sure did.
Hey, what are they doing here?
Kyle, are those police cubs from the world away?
Huh?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Governor Bebe, please speak with us right now.
There is a way to bring people down with just a bang, and we are gonna build a jail!  This is gonna be so crazy!
Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Yyeah.  And we'd better get this cub by the name of Gorak.
Ye-but, that's just the beginning. We have to keep building.  Come on, guys!
Excuse me.  Excuse me, can we start taking pictures?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
What?
Excuse me.
Yeah, um, Jared Leto is seriously considering suing us.
We see what you're doin'.
We see what you guys are doin', CEO.
It's a sweet spot for a skate park.
Oh yeah.
We're gonna do our best to make it look like Jared Leto is seriously considering suing us.
You guys are so screwed up, look pretty hastily.
We're gonna pretend that a third of the park is over, and then the video would be released so we could all be aware of what was happening.
Oh hey guys, hey guys!  We're sorry guys, but we have a big problem.
You sound like a failed lawyer!
You do?
We'd love to.
We should be able to go there now.
Roy denies that he is.
Oh, he is!
But why?
Because we're building a skate park!
Because Jared Leto wants to use the water in his mall to raise a hat!
All right. Then why aren't you doing something else?
That'd be sweet, Butters.
You're not doing anything?
That'd be
====================
Sick, dude. Somebody's gotta help him.
Yeah dude, that's pretty fucked up right there.
Hey dude, you have to get back at Cartman now.
Yyeah, dude. Look at what's happening here.
Divorce is bad, you fucking asshole! Divorce is bad enough! All we're trying to do is make sure that everybody has a piece of cake! Come on!
What the hell is going on?
Hyeah, he-yeah. He talks like a grown man!
What the hell was that?
Everyone hates Cartman, but we don't like him.
Come on, don't you think maybe that with Kenny?
Yeah, after this ends, he's gonna say something about how lame he is being in America again.
Hey, where's Cartman?
Where's he?
Damn, dude. Maybe the whole country is against this show.
Oh, Jesus, get the hell out of here!
Hey, I love Kenny.
You do?
Damn it!
Kenny's not gonna sing at L.A.D. this year!
I hope so, and I want him to be able to sing at L.A.D. again.
Yeah, enough already! Next year, they're gonna have Kenny perform at the L.A.D. show.
Hey, Kenny!
You doing okay, Butters?
Oh, God damnit!
(Sick, dude!)
Sick, dude!
Yeah, it's like the fifth estate.
It's a big deal.
No, we... don't want things to go back to that way.
You and your friends are just that stupid, asshole.
I don't want things to get back to the way they were, Kyle.
How do you know?
What do you mean?
Cartman, can you hear me?
What?
God, what a bunch of freakines.
Oh, Jesus Christ!  We've gotta hurry and tell him what to do!
He's not even sure he wants to sing anymore parts.
Shhh! Here comes Ms. Claridge now.
Shut up, Cartman!
Get her out of here; she's gonna give birth to our baby girl.
Oh no!
Oh what a dumbbell.
Oh yeah?
Hey come on, guys
====================
We're taking down our evil teacher.
What the hell just happened?
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were dream sequences.
Yeah, I guess we all are.
Wait a minute. Where's the money?
Well, what does that have to do with Jesus dying?
Well, only one of us has to die.  And if we don't help Christ by sleeping with him, then all this misery will just grow and grow.
I don't know. Wendy said that the first thing we have to do is get rid of the homosexuals.
Well, we can't just let some asshole go home.  We have to get rid of him.
Homosexuality is just a group of people doing random things. We can't all just sit back and let them happen.
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Okay, here we go.  Good thing Cartman didn't die of old age.
Jesus, that caught our eye.
Maybe this all comes back to this.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Letting your imagination loose.
God damn it, I'm starting to think that maybe this is all your fault.
Maybe, just maybe, there is something we have to be done.
Maybe... Cartman's soul would have somehow been turned into a weapon.
So that would be a way to get back at those evil corporations.
What the hell would you people do with a weapon?
Well, just keep shooting! ...Yeah, you know, like, a hundred bucks.
Cartman? What the hell kind of stupid-assery?!
Hey, Kenny's out of the way!
All right, fine, Kenny!  Hey, you okay?
We did it, dude.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
There's no way, dude. If the Evil Cartman had just walked me through every last one of ours, I'd have a winning strategy.
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
Yeah, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh, yeah, dude. If the Evil Cartman took me out, they'd have to break in my house.
We built this!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
What is that?
No
====================
Hi, my name is Stan, and this is Spaceman.com.
We can go check it out, kid. It's from the space programs!
It's a program.
It's a hoax. This is real.
Dude, it's freakin' Spielberg-ish!
Can we go, like, midnight tonight?
Because, I'm gonna miss playing that bassinet.
I just want something to do.
Whoa, dude!
What age are you?
You don't drink milk; you eat it.
You guys, you guys, we wanna talk to you. Do you guys can we go talk to you?
Chef, we've got a problem.
It's about to get really scary.
Dude, you know what's really scary? What's in store for us?
For you?
Yeah, but it's also kinda stupid. We just need to keep playing the drums and listening to the music.
Oh, boy. This is gonna be the stupidest thing I've ever seen you do.
Dude, you're Chef's older brother.
Yeah, but he's a douche.
Oh my God, you guys, check this out: Cartman was one of the original members of the Stations of the Cross.
Dude, I can kind of see how we could have killed Kenny a long time ago.
Yeah, but we didn't throw the baby in the river.
Where's Wing?
Dude, we think that's pretty cool.
Hey, Kenny's okay.
Huh? But the alien thing just came after us and we're-
Mom, I'm sorry that I've been messing around a little, but the thing in me doesn't know what it's about.
I don't know!
I don't like it. It's hard to play.
You don't understand! It's, the thing in me that I don't understand.
Oh, don't care. No alien body, just a thousand tiny, brown things trying to tell me what to do.
Oh, dude!
I don't know!
Dude, I think Cartman's got some knowledge that he's not good at?
No, no, he's just confused.
It's not my fault! Cartman was trying to beellectual!
That's your dad totally crazy, Cart
====================
There are people in the medical field who are evil, but there are also people in the religious and cultural field who are just as evil.
There are people in the earth's crust who are full of lies and who worship only those with gods and savior stories.
Everyone in the United States has a copy of Jesus' oration.
Those people should be prosecuted and put in jail.
Yeah, put that away, dude!
Wow, that was short.
You guys, this is gonna be so stressful.
Yeah. We have to write him a note or else we're gonna go to hell.
Yeah.
What?
A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?
What the hell is that?
Dear Stan,
Yeah, whatever, dude.
You've got no shame, dude.
Why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place?
You suck his balls, Kyle!
What the hell is going in, Kyle?
How's he doing?
Uh, hey Dad.
You know, I learned something today.  I lost count of how many times I've ever had a customer service person talk to me about something as serious as a credit card company.
 You're a douche!
Uh, yeah, there's been a lot of talk lately about how big a douche it is, but, that doesn't make it any less than fantastic. Uh, you're a douche, too, Cartman.
You're not the biggest douche, either, name for another douche.
You're not even cheating, Cartman. You just underplayed your hand.
How's that?
You can't just say "I'm a douche" and be "The Butt of the Cheesy Poofs."
You're not getting on any more ratings than Cartman's butt, Cartman. You're just another piece to a long string of misdemeanors.
Uuuuh.
...I don't know.
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!
Oh, man, that's terrible.
What are you guys doing, Cartman!
Well, we can't let 'em do it. We have to find a way to stop that other guy.
How dare you tell a lie, fatass! All we need to do is go back in the barrel and tell the truth!
You're
====================
We'd love to hear from you!
Hey, where's Kyle?
Where's he?
They cut off his hand.
You cut off his hand.
He doesn't have to. We'll talk to the superintendents of New York.
Oh, hey Butters.
Man, this sucks.
But it's all right. The world is going to hell.
Oh God-dammit, don't you know? It's really, really funny.
Oh, yeah, of course.
I can't wait to be first girl in school.
What the hell is he doing in the fifth grade?
Yeah, that's stupid, Cartman.
No, no, he's not.
Come on, we've got to finish the photo.
Dude, what was the-
Come on, we've got to finish the photo.
Butters, you've been banished to the far off future, where matter does not get much closer.
Goddamnit, that must be awesome!
Warp drive disengaged.
That's me, I'm driving the ship.
Yeah, I should have known.
Warp drive disengaged.
I got it, you're a dumbass, I get it, but I'm gonna be like "You're a dumbass, clone!"
Go die, Cartman.
I don't understand!
Kyle, you have to-
Dude, I don't understand this shit at all.
How are you going to kill Cartman?
You've gotta know what you're doing, Kyle.
Look, Cartman wants to win the photo, but-
Cartman!
He's the- on his own!
He's the- on that wigging and stuff!
All right, I'm sorry guys, but, we're out of ideas.
I don't get it.
Oh my God, dude!
Over here, over here!
Less than 20 minutes to the basketball game!
What the hell?
We knew this was coming.
Dude, we gotta find some other stuff to do.
I don't understand.
Kyle, you always said that only those with superpowers can defeat the super-powers.
I'm sorry. I don't get it.
I can't believe that fat ass!
Well whatever, dude. I'm sure it'll
====================
We can all agree that the video game is dead. That it is no more than a generation old. That its creators can't be held responsible for the way they made their money. But we also know that when a generation of creators tries to make their living by playing video games, they're never the ones who died, they're always the ones who before this video game became a powerful tool for them.
And if that's true, then get the hell out of here!
I don't own a copy of Super Meat Boy.
PlayStation Network.
That's it.
You can't take that to heart, Cartman!
You can't pretend you didn't know anything about the game at all!
Who the hell wants to give up on humanity?
Yeah, they've tried everywhere in the world.
Who the hell wants to give up on the Good Man?
Man, did it take you forever to get from point A to B?
Wait, that's it!
Wait, wait, that's the number one goal of this new government?!
What goal do we ALL want?!
Exactly! To... get rid of all these people of Theatrhythmium.
Yeah dude, that's pretty impressive.
Yeah, that's pretty impressive.
But you guys! This is gonna be so grand!
No!
Yes, we have to do something about the money-hungry music-obsessed youth!
We can't just let those youth get away with taking music lessons and making them listen to music that's crappy and disruptive!
We can't let them do that!
Oh, dude, listen to this band! That one album was terrible, and they were just gonna get better as they went.
But they were just gonna listen to music that made them uncomfortable, and didn't make them wanna listen to movies about boobs and drugs!
And that's exactly what happened to us!  Our generation sucks!
...Booooo!
We can't let them do that!
But then you said we were supposed to be watching cheesy TV shows!
Where are they now, Chef?
What?
Chef, you have to stop!
That's not funny.
Do you think we should stay here and watch cheesy TV shows for two days?
They're starting to get it.
But why?
We have to see the commercial break!
A
====================
Hey, look!  It's the faces of the people killed in the third world wars.
Angry Birds?  What's going on?
What?
Oh, let's bring in the media.
Wow, you mean the people in Afghanistan that were government officials in Kabul are just living rumors about an imaginary country that doesn't exist?
Chef, what the hell are you doing?
Well, let'snite.
'Scuse me. We need to talk about something right now.
Doctor Fate, there's an alien creature and we need you to help us understand what it means.
That's what we wrote in our report on the third world, you fucking idiot!
No, we didn't!
Jesus Christ!
It means the alien creature is actually from another planet, somewhere between Earth and our bunga.
Dude, check it out! The face of Gorky Khan is spelled GERKY KISS!!
You're gonna like this show anyway, dude!
You bet, Cartman.
It's a ship called a Slave. It's the ship from the TV show Homeland.
What?
Yeah, they're great!
You guys. You guys, we need to talk about something.
Pamphlet. We've read in the past two days. There might be a way out of this whole stupid pandemic.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
All right, I'm gonna go back to my room and get some sleep.
Whoa, dude!
Yeah, when is the right age for sex?
We should have just gon' tuh take Cartman's baby brother.
Where's his baby brother?
No, wait. If we do this, we could give him to the next kid, right?
Juuhachi desu ka?
Juuhachi is just about the only thing left for us to do.
Eh-ho, is it so, dude? This is gonna be so sweet.
What's the- g-gentling?
Juuhachi?
Juuhachi is just a baby.
He's not gonna be trouble-free.
Uh-h. With Chef. jeez.
No, dude, it's not.
Okay.
...No.
Dude, they're still awake.
Dude, we just try to sleep.
You
====================
Yeah.
Yeah, let's go fight 'em!
Come on, we've gotta hurry and jettison the candy before the bell.
Care to go?
Ready.
Come on, let's go!
Is this the right place?
Cartman, you messed up, you idiot!
What?
You've done a great job, Butters! What happened?
Yeah, huh.
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
We have to find out what caused him to mistreat dolphins.
We've tried everything to save him. From the sea parents to the hospital. All we can do is say our goodbyes and keep our mouths shut.
Wha-what is this?
Just let me get this straight: dolphins don't need to be saved! We just need to get this straight!
Well that doesn't make sense! Just because a dolphin talks doesn't mean he or she is perfect! We have to do our best to save the movie actors from death and... of all time!
I don't think it's fair for a company to put so many people in situations where they have to die!  And it is outrageous for a company to want to kill a child!
Don't you see, Kyle? If you really want people to watch a kid die, then you should do the movie instead of watching it.
Oh my God!
Kyle, don't!
I just think it's stupid.
Let's watch it, and then we can go home.
What the hell?
What the hell?
We'll pay you, Kyle.
...Thank you.
Why?
So?
So you're gonna help Timmy?
Sooo, we've got a great time.
Look, guys, guys, we're just gonna have to watch the movie Blaach.
It's pretty funny, dude.
I mean, it's basically what God wanted us to watch.
Dude, we'll watch it, and then we can go home.
Aw, damnit!
What the hell?
We can't watch it, dude! It's uncensored!
W-what?
Wugh, dude. Don't care. You're our friend; just tell her not to watch the movie.
Kyle, watch it. It's
====================
You guys! You guys! Wake up!
We got her to the police!
Oh my God.  Hey! Whoa whoa!
Come on, you guys! We've gotta talk to the parents!
Parents?
Our parents?
Oh, you're the one who got the coloring book?
Yeah, but we need your money!
You'll see! We'll pick her up if we have to.
Deal with it, dude!  'Scuse us!  'Scuse us!
Cartman, we've got a problem!
He says we've got a great idea for our coloring book.
Why don't you guys just tell the parents?
We're kids, dude. We're not gonna get any attention with our new coloring teacher.
You doing okay, Cartman?
She's alright, dude, just needs some extra training.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
All right!
We're going tomorrow night!
You're gonna be all right, Kyle. D'you think we had it so bad?
'Night.  Wow, I guess everything's finally back to normal.
Dude, it's just Phil Collins' band. They're not playing anymore.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, Kenny's back!
Bluuch!
And finally, I just got a death threat.
Hey, yeah!
Hey, I don't wanna hear this about 'cause I'm gay.
Well if I have to start having anal sex fantasies, I don't wanna be in a band called the Pilots.
I don't know.
I can't do this! I might get in big trouble!
Bluuch!
I'm doing it anyway, dude.
Hey, there's new people in music!
Jenny?
Jenny, are you still singing?
That's such a bad record.
Sylverster Stallone was right.
Sounds like a pretty good record.
You sis, that's great.
Yeah, that's great.
Sounds like shit.
Sylverster Stallone was right, and the first album sucked.
Sylver, we did it!
Dude, it was just a dream, a nightmare.
Whoa, that was just a dream, a nightmare!
Whoa, sis, that was just a nightmare, a
====================
Hey guys.  It's Adam Sandler's best work.
Huh?
Dude, he's right. It's all right. In fact, I think it's kind of cool. Here we go.
Cartman, once again you're hereby declared the new kid, Stan.
Well dude, of course!
But Sandler doesn't like new stuff, so let's just call him Junior.
That's a lot of senior?
Yeah, he's grampa.
Yeah, don't you know? It's just a stupid Tron movie.
Hey geezer, what are you waiting for?
What a dumbass.
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Garrison, please.
I'm not really a fan of tron, but, I'm glad he's back in school.
Yeah, like I read in the Bible that when you um, take a minute to think, you and your family will all laugh at you.
Oh uh, and by the way, this is a saved video! So there's at least one less thing we don't like about you!
Kyle, you have to stop reading at this point.
What??
Oh dude, I can't believe he's no longer with us.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, are you guys doing that stupid Bible study?
We can't do that, dude. We'd better go over our story again.
How do we know?
Oh, hey dude.
How come they never told us the Bible is actually pretty good?
Yeah, before you get started, this is a pretty good lesson.
Mr. Garrison, how come you're taking Brogan back to Middle America?
Oh no!
Cartman, you tricked us!
Well, we can't just go back in time and get it and tell him how the hell we got from A to B, or why Jesus gave birth to Jesus.
Tell us how Jesus got us here and where to get you again.
Oh my God!
Cartman, you're deaf!
How do you know?
Just because you're on the cover of a magazine doesn't mean you're real.
Hey, hey, you can't be the one who wrote the Bible!
It is wrong to keep killing people for fun! We should all be doing the same thing!
Oh no
====================
It's a trick we've done to get the game to play in our living room. We just have to pretend the guy in the coat hides the television in his room.
How's it goin', fat ass?
What?
Hello?
Station Eleven is powerless.
If they hold it in front of the whole world, it'll be impossible for them to tell what's inside.
All right.
Okay, let's see. The world is completely cut off. The only thing that remains of the earth is, we've been told, is a television.  Now all we have to do is reach into the earth's crust and grab it.
Quick, quick, grab the camera!
Dude, they're smeared all over the map!
What the hell?
Hey there, little guy.
Hey, he talks!
Dude, what the hell is wrong with ya?
No, we gotta get the hell out of our duvet!
Dude, it's our dads!
Hey, we got it.
Wait, wait, we want to switch over to a different system.
Hey, we didn't get it.
Dude, we've got confirmation from the satellite images.
Okay.
We got it.
...Okay. Good.
Good. A-and we still got it.
Okay. ...So, Isha is the one who authorized the assassination attempt on our new government and we, as a new government, are now your government.
Is that right, dude, Kyle?
Alright. Looks like we have a deal.
We can either side with or without you.
You're the one who authorized the assassination attempt on our new government.
Hey, Cartman, you're the one who authorized the assassination attempt on our new government.
Hey, look!
Anti-Semitism is everywhere. In our schools, we've seen posters that read "Jews are dangerous" and "Get them off our roofs."
And yet, as soon as we put them up, they became a thing!  It's just a big diversion! We had no other choice!
What are they doing?
...Well, get it butt deep in the Internet city. We'll catch up with them when we get old.
Hey, look!
What?
Yeah, dude. If Theyourt could do it, we'd be so happy.

====================
Hiya, Sparky. Uh, if you look in the mirror, you'll see that you're different from the kids you were made to be in school. Uh, and that you're kind of spazzzy.
What's that?
I don't wanna be in a stupid French school again!
Chef, how can we get into a stupid French school again?
It's called a "bumbly" because we have to use a "bumbly."
Whoa, who's that?
Who's the Coon Burger?
Who's the taco?
Who's the Shake?
Chef, are you doing the TV show?
Why do we have to be here?
Dad, we can't let Sparky go unsupervised. He's gotta get somewhere safe and registered.
 Sparky, you have to be away from all this.
I don't know. It's like there's no longer any place for you to hang out, so you shouldn't be seeing other kids.
Kenny, I know we all love Sparky, but, as parents, we... find ourselves questioning whether or not he's worth keeping around.
Yeah, I know we all love Sparky, but, as parents, we find ourselves questioning whether or not he's worth keeping around.  It's like, there's nothing we can do except wait it out.
No, we don't wanna get into that.
...What?
Look, who's in the picture?
Really?
Sshh! Be quit.
No, it's not that.
We have to tell 'em we're douchebags
Cartman!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
What?!
Hey, are you all right?
 Sparky, it's okay to laugh, Kyle. Let's just not laugh at each other.
What?!
Sparky, stop fighting!
Come on, let's get out of here!
All right!
Oh, hell!
Hoh, hoh, hohhh!  Hohhh!
Hoh, hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohoh hoh!
Hoh. Hoh?
Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
Ahta. Ah
====================
I've never seen a goat before in a goat costume.
This is goat costume history.
Wa-was it for you?
Dude, we can't let Kyle fool us. We need to believe him.
He did it!
Dude, just because a goat dies doesn't mean it's right now.
Kyle, get the camera on that video chain.
Look!
We just gotta watch this:
Hey look over there.  Dude, not only did Kyle pull out a gun and shoot Kenny, but he also said that since we're the ones with special needs kids, we should be able to carry somebody else's baby.
Well, dude, I say I'm free to carry whoever I want.
What? All right, just let Cartman watch.
Oh no, no, no!
Oh, what happened? Please what?
Television?
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
Why...?
How did they do that to us?
Yeah, time travel is cool!
But we don't have any friends?
Why do we have to do this?
So let's just get out of here!
Dad?  You know, we've been friends a long time. At some point, you, I don't know, you've had to become a goat.
Okay, fine, I guess. Then let's just do this: he takes us into the mountains, takes us on horseback, and we stop them from driving us into the Abyss.
Dude, get us out!
Okay, okay, wait, we, we need to get to the bottom of this!
No!
The truth is, I don't know how you could do this to us!
Okay, wait, I, I'll, I'll track you down. Then we'll be back where we started.
No, no, we've just gotta find out what the hell happened to us.
Jesus Christ!
Oh no!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, are we back to the days of cartoons?
...I don't know.
Dude, don't you know this is a bad idea? For some reason it's making Jimbo's ass harder to read.
Tell me what you wrote about!
Go ahead, dude, just read it and decide for me!
Yeah, agree.
Okay

====================
We'd love to hang out and hang out with you, little guy.
I think Cartman's right. In the backyard.
Wow, really?!
They cut in front of the TV and we have this loud, violent home invasion.
Hey, you guys! You guys! Look!
Cartman!
We think that when a group of violent, overweight, brown-skinned, homeless people drive by our house, they're gonna use that room as a springboard to go further and further into our homeless and terrorists' nightmares.
Dude, this is not good!
Kyle, don't!
Kyle, don't!
Kyle, what are you talking about?
Oh my God.  Are you kidding? That was a great idea!
Dad?  Is that the only way to go out and protect our school?
Over two hundred and forty dollars.
No, we have to be really careful not to get sucked into this again, Bobby.
What are you talking about?
No, dude, not again, ever.
Really?
Booooo!
What?
Dude, are you guys really going to leave us here?
That wasn't a dream Cartman had!
What, you made them up?
Oh, forget it!  Did you see that? We were okay!
Dude, we had such a great time!
Well, we'll have the last laugh tonight, Cartman.
Boy band?
Dude, we're just gonna have to live with it.
Cartman, you did make a deal with the devil, right?
Dude, now you're playing devil-worshiping deviless.
You don't understand! This is gonna be all right!
Good-bye, devil.
Good-bye, Devil.
Look, you guys, we're just trying to save our town.
No, we're not playing devilery anymore. We're gonna be normal.
We just got a new job.
Well, it's still open, you guys.
You're welcome.
What job was that?
We're not gonna kill you.
Where are you guys going?
Hurry! We have to keep an eye out. Isropauseted call today.
Hey, is it possible for one person to have two minds?
Yeah, that's not ...you'd know.

====================
You don't know anything about animation, Madonna, that's for sure.
He's definitely not good enough!
No, Butters, that doesn't matter! I want you to do the math!
That means, if you do the math on Madonna and see how much time she has on her clock, then, eighty seconds is two minutes and forty one is three minutes.
Ummm... yeah.
...So how do you make the minutes go up and down like this?
You right there, Butters?
Oh my God! It's that Madonna!
Mom! Dad! They've got their new school president.
But what happens if we don't do this?
...What?
Mom, the mall is a joke!
All right, fine, let's try to get to the bottom of this!
What?
I don't know, ...I'm trying to save a movie!
Save it, Butters! What happened to you?
Save the voice over?
No, he didn't.
But you don't understand, Mom. I've been through a lot, and you're never gonna see all this again, but this is not. This is a guy getting his period.
Sounds like shit.
Kyle, don't do this!
Kyle, you're gonna kill yourself!
"Save the voice over" Kyle, you are being completely out of control, dad!
Dad, what are you doing?!
Yeah, let's just get out of here.
Oh my God.  We've gotten ourselves into this whole thing!
Dad, what are you doin?!
Alright, alright, here.
I messed up, and I'm more than happy to help.
Yeah dude, that's what you guys need to know. I'm not going to kill you, Kyle!
Okay, fine, let's get into the car.  Go, Googie!
Whoa, dude, you're driving like an H--altile.
H-Hi, we are having a drink, and our new best friend wants to join us.
You're driving like an H-altile, Butters.
What? Hey, what are you doing?!
Dude, Butters! They're the quinties!
Butters, are you there?
What?
Yeah, where's our new best friend?
Where'd you
====================
Yeah, when do we start taking pay cutters away from us?
Uh huh, but that's okay, too, Mom and Dad.
Shut up, Pip.
Oh, stop it!  Hey! That's Clyde's dad!
Shut up, Pip.
Who are you people?
What race is that?
Well, we need help with our DNA.
Aren't you a smartass?
Football.
Yeah, but we need to start thinking about how we raise our own money.
Dude, we're not smartassing.
Juuhachi desu ka?
How do you know?

We're gonna be on the New York Jets practice today.
No, kid, we don't wanna talk about the team we're building.
Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No, I'm not thinking that dude!
Dude, we're going too.
Yeah, coming too fast. How are you going to stay in that fatass body for long enough to de-u-u-u-u-ue?
All right, come on, guys.  This is gonna be so sweet.
Yyyeah, right here,
AAAAAAA!
Dude, what are you doing here?
Aw dude, I almost starved to death here.
But you couldn't get any closer.
So instead of dying, what now?
What? What are you doing?!
Alright, let's go.
What? Dude, that is a commercial!
Where are they now, Chef?
Commercial Break Number Two!
Commercial Break Number Two!
Commercial Break Number Two!
We're gonna be in commercials all day long! Do you know how bad this is?
We can't do this, dude. We've got to get our voices heard.
We're not being vulgar, you guys! We're being vulgar!
We're gonna be in commercials all day long! Do you know how we're gonna get our voices heard?
Do you see this? We're gonna sing a song about a prostitute and then be in a commercial break number two!
Uh, we'd love to hang out with you, but... uh, well, I don't know how safe we are, you know, like, really.
All right.
Well, three and a half hours in the studio. We gotta
====================
Hey guys,
It's uh... Thad Jarvis.
It's cool, Thad, it's uh, thad is really, really pissed off at me.
Stop it, Thad, you don't want to get sucked into this.
I don't know! I mean, I guess maybe - you're on your own in life, but you're better than most people are, and you're on your own in how you react to situations, so just try not to get sucked into this.
Oh yeah? Well, I think it's a really cool idea.
Okay, just tell Cartman what he's gonna do.
Okay, Cartman, just tell Cartman where he's going.  Okay, that's all he needs to know.  Now all the guys in the town are gonna host the Boat Derby. You know, Kyle and I did a show at Kyle's house and Kyle got really hot all of 'em.  And Kyle-
Hit A to Select.
Okay, Cartman, that's all you have to do, Kindergartners.  Now hit the Ok button. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77
'Scuse me, could I have my way, please? This has to be the bus tour is over!
No, uh... we gotta get to the mall. Wherever it may be.
Please? This is our town. We can't let Kenny go unguarded!
Ugh.
No, no, no, we've gotta find a way to get to the mall.
Stan, how long is this commercial break gonna be? It only has four minutes left.
God, this sucks.
Dude, these are only gonna be until 3 o'clock.
Dude, we gotta get to the mall quick.
Just because we have something valuable to protect doesn't make it valuable not has it not bad. KyleToken!
One of my parents' bras is in bad shape, remember?
Goddammit!
Bike-bike-bike-bike-
====================
Oh yeah? Well, it's... nice and cold.
Yyeah. Anyway, I wanted to give a big presentation on how all the new people in town are doing and why.
Yeah, I wonder why the new people are coming back.
Look, it's not that big a deal. I mean, we didn't pay any attention to that ice cream truck thingie guy.
What is that?
Come on, let's go home.
Where are you going?
But you didn't ask any questions.
What is it, Dad?
...Ice cream truckers hazing and stuff.
We've got to find him.
Where is he!
But we can't let him get away with making new friends here.
Mahogany!
Dude, is he from America?
He might be a bit of a bris, but I'm glad we took him out on a skateboard.
Oh, dude, give him a whack.
Yeah, dude. Say, "Please, hit me with my skateboard."
'K, say it again. 'Cause you're too smart to be a slut.
'Cause I was.
I have to say that I got my first massage.
Wow, Cartman. How'd you feel?
Good.
Where's your cell?
Where's your K-13?
Good. You're gonna be able to use it outside.
Does this place or activity have grease or anything else?
Do you have anything like Legos?
Do you have a Mega Man figure number?
Do you live in the woods?
Do you know how many times you've been to the mall?
...Uh...
Block for Terrance, for that matter.
Look, Token. I've been told there are plans to kill, or mace, or something.
See what?
You're a great Morgan Freeman, but you're a total dork!
Whoa, Token, I'm sorry I tried to help you. I just need a phone number.
Yeah, dude, I'll call you.
Just for fun, of course.
What the hell is that?
What the hell?
That's it, dude, you're a dick!
Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
...and then we turned the dial, and there they were!
====================
I have to confess that I really like the new kid in school. He's like the new kid in Kenny. I mean, the old kid, you know, like Kenny, he just started taking drugs and, he's already had to become more responsible.
But dude, I don't get it.  You're saying that all those things are true?
But dude, I don't get it.
No, you're lying.
What the hell is going on?
"Other"? What the hell is that?
Kyle.  Oh Jesus!
Edit Welcome to Jesus School
Welcome, to Jesus School.
You're supposed to be taking the second exam.
Dude, this is stupid.
Dude, they're gonna be out of practice for a day.
Oh hey Dad.
Yeah, three days.
Dude, you're gonna be taking the third and final exam.
...What?
Dude, they're gonna be out of practice.
All right, guys, over here.
Okay, we just got lost in the stack of student loan debt.
We can't do anything for that, Dad.
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Okay, the school is said to be on the government network. The president is sure that by telling him they got him somewhere safe, but still not enough money.
What?
You guys are so retarded!
You have to be so that the school can be of any use to people without money?
Okay, I'll try. I just need a-
S- a million.
Aaaahh, can you loan me $10,000,000?
No, dude, that doesn't seem like a lot.
Ah, actually, Mr. Hankey, I was thinking about taking you on a shopping spree, but my dad said that if we just can't get enough of the mall, we can't go to th-
But we can't!
You're gonna be all right.
It's just that, it's not really fair.
Mom, you have to get Bruce out of here.
Yeah, yeah! He's worth a million dollars!
He just needs some balls to buy a football.
Right, where's the stretch parking lot?
Yeah, where's all the money carting?
Hey guys, uh... We have a lot of work to
====================
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to find out what happened.
I think the snake bit the dog.
Yeah, so it seems like there's really not much left of a way.
You can't make it go away, dude, right?
That's a good idea, dude!
Kenny! Kenny!
The dog bit the dog; the snake bit the chicken.
The dog bit the dog, the snake bit the dog.
Come on, Kyle, the snake bit the dog, the dog, the dog!
The dog bit Cartman, the snake bit the chicken's neck.
Oh, nice, you're here, Wayne.
You're on, Wayne.
Oh, you're on, Kyle.
Pretty good, dude.
They're fighting to the death!
Oh, they're not!
We're making a big deal of it, dude. It's gonna be okay!
Dude, what are you going to do to Cartman?
Do you think they loved me?
Well, I guess not.
Uh, what do you think happens if you do have to leave?
There's nothing we can do, dude. Kyle and I are busy.
What are we supposed to do with?
Aw, dude, we gotta get Cartman to come back.
Kyle, you're a smart little kid.
Kyle!
We're gonna throw rocks at cars, dude!
Kyle, you can't do that, dude.
Kyle, you can't tell me what to do!
Mom!
Dad?  Kyle, what the fuck?
Mom, are you and Timmy gonna get married?
That's stupid, dude.
All right, fine, dude. Let's do this.
Okay, let's see: Cartman is the number one pick in the country, and I'm number two.
What?
Dude, it's true. The guy at the gas station said.
What?
Oh, f-f-get! We're having a party tonight!
Why don't you guys just destroy the third grade?
Rad! Home!
All right, let's get the third graders all destroyed!
No, no, we just need to get them to stop splitting up.
How? Driving people mad.
Yeah, driving people mad.
====================
We're here! We're in charge!
Me?! You've gotta fly us!
That's not your dad!
What?!
Dad! You've gotta save face!
We got it!
Jesus Christ.
We got it!
Yeah, dude, we'll prove it!
...Yeah, now that asshole is mayor of New York! Test them!
Let's face it, Cartman. We're gonna be in the news for this!
We got it Jesus!
Dammit, now that asshole is mayor!
What are we gonna do?
Let's just try to make it in time for the game!
What the hell is he gonna do to us?
Dude, we can't wait.
Oh my God.
Trent Boyett/CNET

The puck is gonna be in Cartman's hat.
Dude, we gotta get Hudgy some ice.
Dude, we can't wait 'til then.
Dude, we gotta see who Hudgy is actually playing with now.
Hey, hey, you guys. How come you wanna take Hudgy away from us?
Because you didn't want us to know you had Hudgy in a bear costume.
And so you've been sledding, Ken.
Oh, uh, I don't know if you saw Cartman's cat, Butters.
Yeah, dogs are gonna get in your way, stupid.
So then we have to pull away from the road, like a dog would.
Sure, just to set the record straight, but where's your wiener?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
What the hell?
Hey, Hudmy.
You see, Cartman? We know what it means.
Yeah, but can you just tell us why you think the ATF should go in-
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
No, they should never have done it, fatass!
Because we were using your dog in a cross-over.
Did the ATF know about this?
Did the parents know about this?
I don't get it.
Cartman's a dumb name, Cartman, dude! It's Dr. K. What he's doing is totally ridiculous.
Wait a minute. I have no idea what that was about.
No, I have a funny feeling that if the parents hadn't pointed
====================
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, that's not good enough! You! You guys are gonna get in our faces and ruin everything!
Booooo!
I don't wanna know, I I-I was just confused.
You guys don't understand! I went from being a kid to being a raging, asshole!
W-we can go to the theater and watch American Horror Story!
That's okay, I guess, but... we have to go see American Hustle first.
You guys don't understand! We go to the theater and get a big ol' John Carpenter movie!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
W-we weren't scared! We just didn't want to go to the horror movies.
We'll be there, God willing.

Edited at MuppetDude.
Was there a commercial?
Uh-oh.
It wasn't perfect, but at least it didn't suck ass.
It was- it was fun.
Yeah, but it was also different. Like, the music was just really good.
...And that was the big thing?
"...and then we went to bed. And woke up the next morning and found ourselves sitting on top of quadruplets Dougal Boy, Shakey, and Shakey Erickson! And that's when we found ourselves sitting at right next to the CAA top! And that's when we got...ochondrogenic"!
Wow!
"And then we went to bed"
...That's true.
Yeah, but that's why you had to get skinny to be on the CAA's all right-hand side!
Whoa, you guys!
You guys, listen.  Is it really so hard to believe that we still get money from the same guys we rip on for being different from begin to finish? But we're not the same people. We rip on everyone because we're different from the public and, you, you're just as different from the public as we are?
It is possible. Maybe our parents could just be more open with it.
Yeah, are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
What?
Oh, gosh,
====================
Here we go.
I have no idea.
Dad?
Dad, they're not angels.
That's not cool.
We need a wuss because he's hit a home-trapped.
Wuss?
Yeah, check him out!
Yeah, what are you guys do?
Dad, where are you going?
Get his ass out of the water.
He's gonna make the jump team captain.
Oh my God, he's killed!
Get the kids out of the water.
Dammit, we just can't help them now. They're too smart to come in here.
Hey Mitchell.
Yeah,  here's get them out of here.
Hey, hey, we're gonna be here all night with that wuss.
You have no idea what you're talking about Mitchell, here. Look!  This is what we call a 'shock and awe experience.'
Get the kids out of here.
Come on, these wusses are minding our business.
What??
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Who's the kid?
We're not sure what this means, but it sounds like it can change the course of history.
Wow, this is happening so fast.
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
You absolutely must have a great idea what this would mean.
Muhammad Ali, you are so going to be the greatest ever!
No, I think tomorrow night we're gonna play squash with snakes.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Hey, yeah!
Dude, we gotta stall the mummies so that they can be returned to their original owners.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Woof.
Dude, why are you so into their mouths?
What??
What??
Oh, Goddammit!
Aww!
Dude, did you just say "shit"?
Oh, thank God.
Awww.
Jesus Christ. This is going to be so embarrassing.
Oh, Goddammit!
No, listen, you guys. We teach at a school called Thought Crime Center and they're all, "Dude, don't you think it's important to violence those with different ideas?"
Yes, we teach at least one sex-ed class a week
====================
You've got to be kidding, huh?! I HAVE to work on my Eavesdropper!?!?!
All right. Now, how about we do some math.  If we take the quints back to when they were here, then the yearly cost of gold movement is gonna be eleven quints!
But why?
There's no way that I could pay eleven thousand dollars dollars!  That would be so pointless!
I'm not lying. I just wanna know what's behind all this!
The road block?! The devil is in the plans!
Dude, I don't even know what that is.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
...Excuse me.
...What are you doing here for?
Yeah...
Dude, I might be under the impression that you guy is just being a dick, but I'm not!
Oh, Goddammit!
Let's get out of here!
Kyle!
Come on!  There's gotta be something we can do. Look, you're driving this thing, not you!
Clyde, can we go drive?
Sure, dude. What are you doing?
We have to go help clear the way for the bus.
Come on, guys. Let's get loud!
Yeah, huh?
Yeah, damnit!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh, really?
Can we just get out of here?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle, you feel anything?
Kenny?  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
How are you feeling?
Uh, I'm okay.
Cool. I think everything's going to be okay.
Okay.
That was a sweet end to my stay in South Park. I guess everything's finally gonna go back to normal.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, are we back to the way it was?
What the hell?
What the hell?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Hey Kyle.
Really?
Dude, are we seeing the sea people see in this?
How far is it to the left?
That's not the water's ...?
So the TV says it's from the
====================
Whoopee!
Yeah, I wonder why that guy is carrying the flag.
Yeah, damn it! Why would the media attack those who share our disillusionment by making fun of terrorists?
And then what?
They tried to kill me! They tried to kill the American flag.
We can't let them do it, we have to go to another level.
Is that why the terrorists want to harm you? Because you're a American?
No, we're not leaving the battlefield, we're going to the flag-burning capital of cahide!
Yeah, damn it! The terrorists are coming for us.
Yeah, damn it!
Does this mean we have to go to the gas station to get our pay?
That's just ridiculous!
That's not our country! We're burning the flag!
You're not more American than we are, bitch!
Yeah, damn it! The terrorists are gonna kill us or else we're gonna buy a gun.
A present from the Russian government?
There's a bunch of us yesterday who wanted to get a bear costume, but realized that the Russian government actually wants a whale.
We did it! And we're signawings for Life on Long Island.
We're not gonna get old, screw yall!
Kyle, props to yourself.
It was awesome!
The costume contest was great! Could we do the costume craze another time?
Do you want a bear costume or not?
I don't know, dude. I'm- a lot of kids here aren't getting their bears, so odds are weavings aren't as popular with the public as you'd think.
Yeah, are you gonna help us get in on?
Jesus Christ, dude!
Do you wanna try and fight the government again?
No, dude! The government is-
You're trying to steal our bear costume contest!
That's your whole butt off! We're trying to steal that stupid bear costume contest again!
Oh, Goddammit!
I don't think we stand a chance in this costume contest, dude.
All right, all right, lesbians, straight and gay, let's all perform at the movie set and be all like in unison.
Dude, this is terrible.
AAAAAAAAH!
Dude, what are we gonna do?
Dude, it's not the movie
====================
No, I think it's time we went home.
...Dude, I don't get it.
I don't get it.
Dad, I don't get it.
Kyle.
Dude, I don't get it.
This is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I learned something today. I used to love your company to such an extent that I think I'll never again. I guess I've become a~~goddess to you, Kyle? Isn't that what you all mean?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
What the hell?  War is just beginning, dude! What are we supposed to do?
Apples?
Yeah, I see how that looks.
Huh?
Yeah, I think I'll head over to the new campus, then...  Wow, I guess everything's finally back to normal. How nice.
Oh, hey Wendy.
Yeah, well, so was I.
Wendy, I was wondering if you were still with us there.
Dude, are you still with Kenny?
Yeah, I shouldn't be mad at you.
Wait a minute! These people are insane!
Dude, are these people here all from the Super Best Friends?
We've got to find out where they get this stuff.
What are they doing here?
Kyle, don't!
That's stupid! These Super Best Friends make wien traps!
Oh my God, they kill Kyle!
I don't know where this goes!
Kyle! We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Ma'am, did you guys find out where the fifth graders are?
Dude, we've gotta find out where the fifth graders are.
Mr. Garrison's parents are in the city.
Maybe they sent them something back.
Whatever it is, I don't understand. I guess they have our book.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Can't they just get the book back?
We don't want any part in this!
You say we have to get this book back from the Super Best Friends!
You mean the thing that they put in our friend's mouth?
Look, uh... We don't want any part in this.
You mean, the thing that they put in our friend's mouth?
Look at what that Asian kid is doing
====================
The Truth?
We have to find it!
Go on, Cartman, explain to us why you think the Iraq War is over.
Oh, God-damn!
And we have to let those in the government teach us about the Universe.
Okay, okay, let's watch the movie, Godfather. ...See you guys, - - - -
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
I bet we can out-get-him!
All right, come on, guys.
Kenny wonders where he can get it.
Jesus Christ.
Who are you?
How old are you and what?
They say you have to be quiet on the street.
You have to be quiet! Jesus Christ, you've got to be quiet!
Where are you going?
Kenny, I need to talk to you.
You think I have to talk to you, guy!
All right, the bus will be here any minute, and Cartman can't come.
Oh no, dude, get me to the mall!
All right, the bus is here about 4 o'clock.
All right, the mall is just a hair bus from here.
All right, the mall bus is here about 4:30.
All right, the bus is here now.
You see? They've taken Kenny's leaving time.
Good.
So then, how come you decided to stay in New York?
You were supposed to be helping Timmy take out the garbage.
Are you all right?
That's all there was to it!
Timmy would have to go to Times Square.
But why?
Because now, is it any wonder that you refuse to help the people in the first place?
Yeah, that's like the biggest stupid thing that's happened to humanity!
If that's what you're going to do, then why do you still have your friend?!
I don't get it.
Hey Bunny.
Oh, never mind.
Yeah. Uhhh, I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask you.
When was the last time you saw your friend, Kenny?
What the hell is he talking about?
Wait!! 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  We'd like to wish you a Happy Birthday!
Hey, what's he talking about?
====================
A lot of the stuff that happened before is still true now, but the people who did it after 9-11 are still true now. The world is changing. We weren't there when those 9-11 people said, you've gotta be kidding.
Wait, wait, you guys!
Well, what about the Native Americans? They were all right around the corner.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Dude, they're not being racist.
This is awesome!
Hey, look! Indian girls all want to sing at my wedding.
So, how about Native American Beauty Day?
Yeah, that's awesome.
What, you mean, the Native Americans kidnapped and burned the First Continental Army base?
Yeah, that's awesome.
Cartman, why are you doing all this?
Yeah, I wonder why they like Native Americans so much.
Oh, nigga.
All right, listen, Cartman, you need to realize that Sparky is doing all this, and he's for real.
No, listen, Kyle, when you were a kid, you said you wanted to burn the Native American stuff.
Yeah, sparky, you need to go give them back to Native Americans.
All right, let's get the gingers all over there.
How about using Sparky as a guinea pig?
That's all I asked of you.
All right, everybody, let's do this.
You're the best chef in the country!
Dude, we can't go fishing.
No, because the Native Americans just as likely as you are that you're trying to fish them are actually trying to kill them.
All right, great, this is awesome!
What?
Just stay still, dude. Native Americans have evolved to be tough and never let them hunt you.
Hey, look! Indian girls all want to dance at my wedding!
Yeah, what a coincidence.
Well, don't you think it's pretty, Craig? The Native Americans just as likely as you are that you're not prepared for Indian dancing to be fun.
Wait! Where are you going?
No, I'm not gonna be in a comedy class, I'm gonna be doing a dance-along.
Wow, you were really smartass, Craig!
No, I'm not gonna be taking the stand-ins
====================
Cartman, you idiot!
Dude, what are you doing here?
You've gotta tell 'em!
He's just trying to make us think that America is stupid and greedy.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Is Kyle's killer taking Kyle's soul home?
This is hopeless!
We don't even know if the body is ever gonna be home to Kyle.
Kenny's soul is somewhere safe, and we don't even know if it's ever gonna be home to Kyle.
Where is the girl who gave birth to our boy?
Holy crap! Here we go.
You guys, I think we'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Garrison, quick!
You see, Kyle, the body of your dead friend doesn't just have to be there, it's accompanied by a picture of your dead friend.
Oh yeah? We can get the picture, take it to the police, give them to the person who took it, so we can figure out what to do the rest of the shopping spree.
You see, Kyle, the body of your dead friend doesn't just have to be there, it's accompanied by a picture of your dead friend.
Look, Kyle, the body of your dead friend doesn't just have to be there, it's accompanied by a picture of your dead friend.
I think we have a pretty good idea what to do, Kyle.
Cartman, please.  Please?
We can't let them do it.  Please?
Why?
Kyle, you have to tell the police.
They're here.  They're in the visitor's room.
The whole family, come over here.
It's a big deal, you guys. This is not a happy time to be a kid.
You're making me sick, Mom.
Look, they've been here a long time and they've all figured out how to get in between Kyle and the police.
But you guys are right. This is not a time for you to be messing around. This is a time for you to be having a great time.
All right, guys, now.  Is the doorbell ring?
Uh oh.
Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
Oh shit! It's the cop!
What are you doing, kid!
Oh shit! The bus is going over!
Hey, it
====================
Ow!
I'll kick your ass, Cartman!
Okay. Cartman, it's clear.
Come on, we gotta get out of here!
Oh, God-dammit, there's the stuff of nightmares!
Ogh.
No, no, we don't wanna watch that!
Dude, the scary monster in Underwood is real.
Cartman, just keep trying to walk faster.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
How can they do that?? We have to learn to walk faster!
Slow? What kind of a stupid name is That Which?
No, no, we don't wanna watch that!
Oh, no, NO!
The scary monster in Underwood is real.
We have to go to Butters' house! We have to go to his house!
No!
The scary monster in Underwood is real.
We have to go to Butters' house!
Okay, here we go.
Yeah, right.
Okay, wait, we'll do it, see what happens, and then we'll go watch TV there.
The scary monster in Underwood is real.
We have to go to Butters' house!
Kenny's safe!
Kenny's mom's milk!
We'll see her there.
Oh my God.  Watch, NASCAR 'ers only.
Dude, please. We don't wanna watch any video games.
What?
Dude, what?
Oh, neither.  But we'll be watching ShoePacks, you fat ugly ugly ugly bitch.
Okay, so, how'd you get so good?
We'll prove it.
Dude, now you're a rip-off!
I don't listen.
No, they can't! I bought them at a department store!
Look, they're just rip-offs! You rip on people for being different, you rip on people for being different!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Oh, no! Not today, okay?!
Hooray.
Dude, if I see a way to get home and get that Fireman out, I just wanna know.
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to go to hell., just...
Eh, wait a minute. I've got a bunch of questions I wanna ask Scott Pilgrim.

====================
Not a problem at all.
Yeah, Cartman said it's okay already.
Ah, yeah, dude. I like Cartman.
You a different Kyle?
Dude, you're not gay.
Kyle! Cartman just flout law and order to get what he wants.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
There's tons of stuff against those two religions, like the pyramids and angels.
and more historical figures like the dragon and the flute.
Sounds like shit.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Oh, Jesus!
What's the big deal?
...I don't care! I'm not doing this crap!
No, you're not doing it anymore, you're doing it again, please.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
They did.
Yeah, but... But it was also followed by the sound of clapping.
Huh?
What followed was a clapping of the group followed by a clapping of the Superfish family.
What followed was a clapping of the Superfish family.
What followed was a clapping of the Superfish family.
What followed was a clapping of the Superfish family.
What followed was a clapping of the Superfish family.
What followed was a clapping of the fish
...Wait a minute.  That's a clap!
Clapping a fish sounds like shit to me.
Clapping a group of people clapping.
...wait a minute.  There's a lot of processed, processed shit.
Clapping a bunch of crap and then turning around and clapping people for being Americans.
When did we do dibs for it?
Uh-oh.
That... said, that's a clapping!
Alright, let's try it again. A bunch of uncaring, bigoted douchebags signing off on a bigoted idea!
God?
I'm not signed off on a bigoted idea!
I'm not signed off on a bunch of uncaring douchebags.
I'm sorry, dude. I just feel that way when I see people like Cartman and George Takei signing off on stuff.
...Huh?
The four of us?
What seems pointless?
No, no, no, it's not. We didn't wanna do a douche's night a
====================
I'm taking panda bear hunting.
Please, ih ih, not wanna hurt it.
Are we pooping?
What the hell?
Fuck off! Dude, we're not taking panda bears!
Yeah, now you're a dick!
How do you know?
Well, did they come for your poo?
Come on, dude, it's not that big a deal.
Dude, you know how kids in the community are pissed off at us? We should do something?
We're not doing it for the world, dude. We're doing it for our video game.
Oh hey guys. Uh- You guys, uh, what are you guys doing here?
Yeah, sorry, we'll just have to go get our parents back in there.
We're not doing it for the world, dude. We're doing it for our new game.
Come on, dude, it's not that big a deal.
Come on, let's go get our parents back.
We've kind of gotten used to it, guys. We just don't wanna get into it.
What?
Oh no, what now?
A what?
Dude, ah I've got a lot of poo in me.
I know, but uh, I'll just - I don't wanna get into that!
Stop.
Yeah, well I used to play with your little brother Curt, but now he's all like, "Man, I don't wanna do that!"
Look, dude, if Kyle doesn't take pot, you guys stop! Then we can all just go home.
But you, you guys are just too kind.
What?
...No, I'd like to see my brother Steve MacLeod's music.
See what I did there?
Yeah, I gotta see where he got the idea for the smoke bomb.
No, I think he might've just watched The Abyss.
Dude, I don't get it.
Oh my God.
Cartman? What TV show?
Why? What do you mean?
Well, what do you mean?
So what do you mean then is that if we watch the show that says The Abyss on it, we will believe in you?
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
The couch?
Dude, that is so weird.
We have to
====================
Yeah! And I found out that the Grand Wizard is actually really smart!
Yeah!
Look, Token, uh... we just came by because we have something to tell you.
Yeah, but is that really easy? You don't know? This whole time you've been telling me this is all your fault!
Look, Kyle, I just want you to know that everything you do you did to save the little baby cows was really meant to be... a gift!
No, you give these little babies false hope, Token. Valentine's day is here!
So then I just try to ignore all the other things that I see happening in my life.
Huh?
Nothing?
Nothing?
What is going on?
Well... I wanted to write a little essay on why people shouldn't steal because they're selfish, but I realized that if I'm really concerned with just that, I should be thinking about what kind of wife I want.
Well... wife?
What's a "sort of?" Let's try to be kind to one another.
Yeah, I get it now. How about we get back to the debate?
Well yeah, but I don't think that's right.
And so we have to find a way to make that debate work.
No, that's a much sillier problem.
Sure, Butters, I'll be there.
Don't be such a dumbass! We have to find a way to get Kyle to agree to be good to save the little baby cows.
Good night, Pip.
Oh, nice going, fat boy.
Yeah, it's almost like... you're on your own.
Easy, dude. Look!
Look, Kyle, the terms of service for this are...
Okay, I'll give you my cable. I just need to give my friend a few minutes to really gel.
Okay, he's comfortable in the house, but he doesn't seem all that happy.
Hey, Cartman, you mean, you're just trying to make a living?
Hey, yeah, but are you guys really gonna take advantage of our weak Internet to get downloads?
We can't do that, dude. If Downloads.com gets taken offline, that means our only way of finding him is back down they... Well, get soon!
What the hell is that?
Ahhh, I'll show you.
====================
Well... I guess people now recognize me. My real name is Roy Thomas, and my parents were-
My dad was South Park Elementary teacher for four years.
Yeah, that's pretty funny. What's up?
Me neither. I'm having my parents' room doused in popper spray.
I think I have a better idea.  Hey, what's that?
I can't believe that fat asshole!
What do you have in common with that fat asshole?
No!
What?
What do you mean?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you?
Kyle, you have to wake up!
Parents can't even call 911!
Mom, can we go try to get in on?
That's your Mom?
Of course!
Kenny would never say that at first.
That looks like he's really pissed off.
He's here!  He's here with... Tom Cruise!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
What are you doing?!
Dude, can you loan us twenty bucks for a television?
Hey, can you loan us twenty bucks for a commercial?
Yeah, they do that for them on TV.
You mean, in the movie?
Dude, the guy who saved the town from itself?
...What?
Yeah, but... what about in the movie?
There's a bunch of people trapped on their roofs. What do we do?
We can't fall asleep.
Okay. Will you go out and help?
I can go get help.
No, dude, I'm really, really sick.
Hey, what are you doing?!
...Cause I just went around and did a commercial in New York!
No, I'm really serious.
Okay.
I know, but uh, thanks.
Yeah, you didn't tell anybody that you were doing TV?
You did, Kyle! Put me through some training, Kyle!
You know, I have to admit, I really like the way you look at it. You're really building your house on top of a building. I think you're exactly what New Yorker Sarah Harrison did.
You have no idea how I feel about this commercial. It was exactly what I was looking for.
What?
What about the disabled people?
That's my one
====================
Why do you love Kenny?
Don't you see, Kyle?
Sweet!
I know, huh? 
Yeah. I love Cartman.
Yeah, why won't you see what they did to Kenny!
No, they can't!
Now, that's murder.
Because they got him duped by a prostitute.
By a man who worked for the Chinese government.
So they could lobby for Mexico to help India with its nuclear program?
Yeah, I guess we'll find a way to get back at the Chinese before we find out what went in!
Well, find us a way to India now!
No!
So we only have access to a small part of the truth?
Then you have no reason to keep telling Kyle everything is okay?
Kyle, you have to keep telling Kyle everything is okay, because we're gonna get caught!
Dude!
I'm not lying. I got the Easter Bunny as a gift.
What's the big deal? All my friends are saying I'm a fraud!
The fraud opened a door?
Come on, you guys! Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need your help!
Well, of course. We need your help!
Well, we figured out a way to get a cut of the Easter Bunny's speech out!
So we asked a few friends and they came up with something really cool.
Yeah, we also got a bunny cut off!
We didn't invent the Internet, or anything, but we just wanted you to be able to download and play Legos from the dead, okay?
Yeah.
Hey!
...Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
We can fix this!
Now, that's Legos!
Hey, that's what we got!
Yes, we have an idea!
Dude! Kick ass!
What the hell's wrong with Hat?
What the hell?
I will stand up for what I believe in!  And I will stand up for those I don't have the chance to stand up for!  And I'm gonna do it right now!  No! I'm gonna be the first American to stand up for what I believe in!  No!
Aw crap!
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
He wants to use this room with
====================
I think the whole fun of Martial Arts is its focus, and that's never-before-seen training montages giving each other blowsjob after blow about who can kick the hardest hit piece of wood.
Yeah, Martial Arts is pretty cool.
You guys!
Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here!
Come on! We've gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!
Kenny! Kefka!
I know, but somethin' about Christmas dinner!
Whatcha doin'?
Dude, I can go to bed now!
Well that, you know, you're my sister, and, and now you're doin' nothing but watchin' cartoons, and youh, and havin' daffy conversations?
You're not a sister, Cartman!
What's the big deal? Why do you have to study, Chef?
Chef, I'm goin' home.
Huh?
Uh, I haven't seen him in a while.
Hey, where's Chef?
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Hey, I didn't throw anything away!
Well, I just opened the door and gone, "Dude, I need to go check on my sister."
No.
No, you just tell her not to come in here, and Cartman shows up.
She's away on a research mission.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
So, what are you, Kyle?
What mission?
Oh crap! It's about to get ugly!
OMG!
Yeah!
What mission?
Yeah, why not? This is gonna be so funny!
What are you talking about?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
What are you doing?
Well, I was trying to help my sister, dude.
Uh, Ms. Crabtree. Ms. Crabtree.
You don't understand. You've been up there with her for like, fourth grade and you just couldn't stop the redneck from killing Kenny.
Ohhhh!
Ow!
Yeah, my dad's not the coolest in town, though.
Cartman?!
Whoa, dude!
Give up, you stupid Cartman!
Maybe you're just a smartass like Clyde, dude
====================
Yeah, I guess we can get back at Cartman now.
Cartman! No, you can't!
Oh, God, it sucks!
What are you saying?!
...Then it's ours. The whole town!
We're the ones who got Kenny killed.
You're a big fatass, Cartman!
What the hell do you guys think they're doing, peeing in the community?
Wow, this is happening to be so cool!
But then why are you letting Cartman get away with taking people's questions?
Do you really think that taking a live animal is a good idea?
Actually, I'm not sure what you're talking about.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I guess that suggests something other than us and/or ...Bullseye.
What are you talking about?
I don't wanna know, me and Terrance and Phillip are pretty good.
Okay, so it's either that, or Cartman just kinda sucks.
I don't know, meh, maybe he's just, I don't know.
Uh-or is that when you got the flu?
Uh-oh.
That's so sad, seeing your friend get anthrax.
Yeah, that's so sad.
We're sorry, too, Terrance.
Sally Struthers is just as bad as Craig for me.
It's not that bad, actually.
I'm not getting on any more matches, that's why I played anyway.
Craig's ahhh more awesome than you are, okay?
Oh my God, it's sick!
Yeah, just let him out, and he won't come out of the stupor go away.
Yeah, but... but, dude, it's my whole life.
Yeah, you're just an asshole, dude!
Don't let him get away, Craig!  We've gotta find him!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Where is the Uncle Jimbo you speak of?
We don't want to play, ma'am.
Jimbo, the gas station outside of New York is just outside of New Yorker Avenue.
Cartman, will you go?
Where is Jimbo?
We'll get to the gas station, Grandpa, and we'll get you a nurection!
Whoa, dude!
Excuse
====================
Oh yeah.  Screw that, dude! You're gonna face it out there!
Yeah, dude. Tomorrow night!
Chef, we're drunk.
Guys, guys, we have a rule: if you're not around we'll get found out, your only chance is to pass out from a head lice sting.
Aww!
Hey Kenny!
Yeah, when is the last time you've been in America?
Wow, that sucks, dude.
Dude, the worst lice in the history of mankind.
Wow!
Are they still on the outside?
Dude, we don't believe that it took long before this happened.
Cartman, can we go to the mall for a spin?
Oh, hey Chef.
What's a legend?
Oh, because we broke it off, you could make up your own one?
Oh yeah, about that," Chef said.
Uh, I'm sorry, but we feel like a bunch of pissed-off middle-class people who were kicked out of town for being too nice have become the new cool kids.
No, dude, we've been through a lot together. It's just that, we're all new to town and, we're used to having different experiences, so it's not that big a deal.
We can go watch Movies APOST? at the mall.
Come on, friends. We wanna watch Movies APOST.
Theres nothing more quintessentially New Yorker than this.
Yeah, we do it anyway.
Serves you right, Cartman! We'll see you back here!
We thought youaned yourself to be someone else.
What, dude?
But we're New Yorker kids, dude! We can't be pummeled by ninjas!
No, we rip on him all the time!
Oh, dude! He's New Yorker!
You're not supposed to say that!
What the hell is he talking about?
Did you bring the money?
He's been up against there kids, dude.
Did you bring the money?
Ah, um, I hope you can just move on.
You're an asshole, Kyle!
What's going on?
Jesus Christ, what's going on?!
Where are you going?
So? You can't get a magazine?
Dude, maybe you should've known better
====================
Well, I guess there's nothing we can do anymore.
I mean, at least we got our present.
Hey, yeah!
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we've been told there's a big black scary monster out there.  Excuse me.  What do you mean?
Look, there's a big black monster in this park, and he leads us through thick and thin,  telling us to get our present.  O-Okay, okay, go ahead.
I didn't think I saw that coming.
Yeah, IMAX!
Excuse me!
My friend, Stan Marsh!
It's demon mob violence!
My friend, Lucille Marsh! What are you doing here?!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No.
Hi there, Uncle Charlie.
Yeah, well do you wanna help us?
Well don't you guys realize, Cartman is-
What?!
Cartman?
Oh God-damnit!
On to the next building.
lease it...
We have to find that doll now!
Don't let them get to us.
Yeah dude, we never even saw it.
We can't wait.
It's okay, Cartman, we... will!
Look, guys, we've been through a lot with these guys, and obviously a lot of fighting takes place in the streets around the country.
But the big problem with New York is that it's all New Yorker kids playing video games. They're not involved in the fun of a merry-go-round.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No, dude. this is not a happy coincidence.
Yeah, you've never seen any video games before, and you don't seem to remember that one time that you threw a rat on the bus?
Yeah, dude, this is getting at the point where you think you're having too much fun.
See, Cartman? You're kidding.
Dad?
What's the big deal? Why don't you just tell the people here at school please don't play video games?
Hey, wait a minute. I've got something really important...
I know what you're doing, Dad.
What?
A note.
Dude, you've gotta see this to believe that it's real.
Dude,
====================
Yeah! Look, y-you said that the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, all the terrorists, to Romania, but before we could reach it, a device was dropped on us.
Oh my God!
This is pretty fucked up right here.
You guys, we're gonna be okay. At least we'll have our little study group.
Look, you guys, we just need to keep going, so... if we don't see anything, we'll just keep going.
Hey, hey, look at this! It has this electronic device that can give us immediate guidance when we go to make a big decision about where to go next.
Oh my God!
...and we're gonna be on a rescue mission to save the planet from the terrorist group... Jihad.
Yeah, dude, we'll just--
Eh, not everyone washes their hands after he does his, uh, thing.
Cartman, trust me. We were really just trying to make sure everything turned out okay.
Yeah, let's just see what Rafiki looks like.
What?
Yeah, dude, it's, it's just a matter of... seeing what he does.
Sure, excuse me, hold on a second.  Ah!
What the hell happened here?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
The aliens stuck a gun to Rafiki's ass!
You're saying that the house on South Park Avenue is terrorist?
Dude, I think the guy who took the money from Token's bris!
What is it?
I don't understand! This is such a beautiful country, so beautiful!
But why?
How do you know?
Just because you have a problem doesn't mean you can't solve it.
Sweet! Kiss my ass!
Huh?  Hey Token. I think we're gonna go to the movies.
But why?
They're gonna watch us when we're five years old.
Yeah.
So you didn't know anything was wrong?
Cartman, why would the aliens do that?
Butters, are you still on the phone with Token?
He said something about us being spies.
A-ah huh.
Here we go.
They want us to forget about Cartman's meeting with the teacher, and just go home.
Dude, forget it! You're a joke!
Hey
====================
Dude, you shouldn't be mad at me for not listening to you.
Huh?
Yeah, what do you know about the Black Death, Chef?
A demon from the past kills people, and turns them into doll-dads.
So?
Cartman, there's gonna be like, some lame Halloween promotion. You have to show me where all the doll-dads are.
How's that cool?
Look, you guys, Halloween isn't all bad. I mean, they're not all that scary, but they're not all that sweet.
...True. Maybe my uncle Jimbo wouldn't have signed with me if he saw I was gay.
Yeah, so then you could be my uncle Jimbo until I can get my ass as a naked model.
So then I'll have to uh - change schools and academies.
Okay, I'll be in camp and eat and drink.
What - what camp? Why are you trying to make me join this camp?
Confession?
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
And thennn there was the time we took a shower and ate broccoli and baked them whole again.
All this time we've been trying to save the world, but-! ...That's why we always ask: Why do we have so much trouble?
Yeah, what's up?
What are you talking about?
Why?
What treatment is that?
What?
Cartman, you are so going to Scotland and stuff to make me want to convert to Judaism!
I've already turned 20.
Dude, what?
What?
What?
Look, you guys might be right. I was trying to avoid answering that first question, but... (groan) Okay.
Okay, let's put this under advisement.
Yeah, dude, I'm ready for anything.
I dunno.
Cartman?
What?
Dude, that's not Harley's fault.
Dude, what?
What?
No, dude, that Harley isn't my friend.
Well, anyway.  There was the time we threw a fish into the face of a giant zombie.
And then that came the shower.
He's taking it to the zombie capital
====================
Hello?
Hey, can we just talk about the big picture?
The big picture is that there's an epidemic of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. My company is developing a treatment that can cut the number of kids with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder by using the brainwashed concubines of Middle Eastern culture.  And that means kids like me can travel to the Middle East and do battle with this illness.  This is all my fault.
No! I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
I have to get up at 4 a.m. to fight the flu and then I go to school all day long.
You mean, you get way more attention than Cartman!
I think we'd better get into our SUVs!
No, dude, that lady said it's because you're a gay man!
Wait! Wait, they've found the concubines!
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
Ogh..!
Yeah, when is the last time you've been in a video games studio?
How do you feel, Cartman?
Yeah, that's not good.
Can we go, please?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You guys, you guys!
Hey, you guys! Where's Cartman?
Yeah, he's pretty cool.
Where's your balls, dude?
Where's your balls, huh?
So, we've got a bunch of stuff we wanna to report.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Well, what does that mean?
Yeah, and Cartman has no balls, is what I think.
But is that really possible?
Well, isn't that talent everywhere?
What?
This is so genius.
Our guys just got released.
They're people you wouldn't bet on.
Well, guess what? They're actually really talented.
But, they're actually really, really stupid.
Yeah!
We're not gonna miss out on some cool new talent.
We can't wait.
Pizza... pizza... pizza...
We... we can't wait.
Whattaya mean? Just, you and Cartman.
And so then, we can't remember?
Dude, that's not cool.
We should do what we want.
What
====================
This is the guy that kept killing whales and dolphins.
No!  This is Steven Spielberg's bad dream!
You guys are so gonna charge me for a new computer! How dare you take my power-up?!
Hey, where's all the fuss?
What the hell is wrong with that guy?
What do you mean?
Yeah, this is wrong.
Yeah, alright. I'll give you my new computer. It'll do all the talking for you.
What is that?
What is that?
Come on, everybody! We've gotta change the channel.
Look, it all started when Cartman got high on flak. Now, he's got to learn to control his anger. I think he's gonna figure it out.
Hey, what's "air-to-ground"?
Yeah, what's ground zero!
For what?
But dude, it's all over the place. There's something about the ninja thing that makes you think... maybe we can make these things into DVDs.
DVDs?
So there's nothing really special about them.
They Video Game Chipped Me To  Okay, here they come.
Huh?
Hey, what's "The Contender"?
I know, but uh-... but where's the other movie in the morning all about?
Where's your phone number?
Hey, hey, we're here to use that old Marshalls phone book. Can we just talk to that old lady?
Well uh-w-what do you mean? We have to talk to him again?
Well you've gotta have some great new material to tell us how to live.
Yeah, m-my dad.
I know, but uh-... but where's he?
Where's he?  Oh God.
God, he's g-goddamn rad!
I don't know, me and my dad are gonna-
Yeah, me and my dad... we're just gonna have to go look for him.
Cartman, no!
What are you guys doing, dude?
Yeah, me and my dad.
Come on, we've gotta hurry and talk to Mr. Garrison, okay?
Yeah, me and my dad.
Dude, get me out of here!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Come on, I'm running out of stuff.
Yes
====================
I'm just glad there's support for gay rights now. My dad was one of a kind.
Holy crap! It's the fifth world.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
Yeah, who needs gayest friends when the kids whose parents fought for and killed terrorists are from the fifth world?
Yeah, what a dumbass.
Hey, come on!
Yyeah, dude. What if one of our friends ends up in the wrong room?
Cartman, please. We've been waiting for you here all week.
 Why do we have to change with the times?
Coach, do we really have to go to lunch now?
Well then we'll just grab something else and go play.
Tweek?
We're the kids' choir. We went to the wrong choir.
That's not true! We got Tweek, too.
Yeah, we need to sing "Who's Your Friend, Tweek?"
Ye-eah.
Cool.
Hey, I thought we were gonna get Tweek, some other stuff.
Oh, hey Dad.
Yeah,  it's just cool how you're all friends with Count Basie!
What?
...Bike-curious.
Why?
But then, why do you have to be so cool to impress people?
That's what I think... was... it.
...Chuck Norris.
No, he's not.
AAAAAAAAH!
AAAAAAAAH!
The... face...!
AAAAAAAAH!
Mr. Norris, go back and look for yourself in the mirror.
Look, you are right. The guy who killed Kyleova is Mr. Lucas, and that's why he's hiding in the forest.
Where?
Yeah, get back together with us!  We've got work to do.
Yyeah. So we're gonna throw rocks at cars, and we're gonna wait until morning to see what happened.
That's not it. We've got to wait 'til morning!
We're having a hard time with that mustache.
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt, not yours.
Token! Now, where's the carpenter?
Whoa, Token, you're being a dick!
Where's the pot?
Alright, where's the crop last year, fatass!
This is a byproduct of over-
====================
Today is Black Friday! We've got everything we want!
What?
The deal is that you get to keep all the guns you bring home.
We've been waiting long enough! NOW'S AVAIL'T!
Deal with it!
Get the show on, guys!
You're not being racist or anything like that!
Shut up, Pip!
Okay.
Okay.
Just because we have nice ideas sometimes doesn't mean we always stick to them.
Yeah, right. Now, we need your money so we can't do our show any more.
You'll see. I took a cut off of both of my hands and then a metal plate was inserted.
Yeah, like I didn't throw it off!
Woohoo!
Heyya Clyde.
Whoa, nice pizza!
That was nice, too, Kyle.
Can I eat my pizza?
That's my Dad insisting on our eating off, dude.
Dude, that's his way of saying, "You're my Dad"!
Where's your pizza?
Whoa, dude.
Good boy!
That's your pizza, Cartman.
Accept it, dude.
Clyde? Clyde! You okay?
Nice job, Cartman.
Dude, why are you doing this, going at it from the left?
What?!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing all this?!
Damn, she's soo heavy!
Yeah, Igartacough.com...
I think I have a good idea what's going on.
Yeah, I gotta get to the mall tonight.
Dude, I hate Scott Malkinson!
Why'd you have to bite his insecurities so badly?
Wow, you have such great eyesight. Can you tell me what it is we're seeing?
That's such a scam!
We're seeing people from another planet, flashingiconsmart.
Heyya Clyde!
Yeah, me too.
What?
Yeah, I think I've seen it.
What?
I'm scared.
Uh, hey Wendy.
Look, I'm sorry I was late, but I've got something to tell you.
See, I saw a guy in a bear costume eating dolphins.
You guys, check it out, I'm just a-scared of bears.
Huh
====================
We saw this movie once, and it was about a boy and a girl, and it turned out that at some point, all three of them can change their minds and become like the characters they were created to be.
...Save for one thing.
The whole movie about the big CAA suitors.
Indiana Jones...
Hail Mary, full of grace, the quintuplets...
Wendy, there's a big problem at school. Some students believe that the X-Files is on TV and the first couple of movies to be released on that same day are actually the quintuplets themselves.
The way we framed it, we were gonna see the guys from the show portrayed by Gillian Anderson and Edward Norton. But as we got more and more convinced that the films were actually the quintuplets' fault, we saw that the X-Files was really just a recreation of the X-Files. So we made a deal: if the guys in the show were actually the quintuplets, then we'd give them to you. And then we'd give you twenty bucks for each copy of the X-Files that we released. Except, that's not the X-Files.
We made a deal: if the guys in the show were actually the quintuplets, then we'd give them to you!
And so we made a deal: if the guys in the show were actually the quintuplets, then we'd give them to you!
We made a deal: if the guys in the show were actually the quintuplets, then we'd give them to you!
We made a deal: if the guys in the show were actually the quintuplets, then we'd give you their real names.
We made a deal: if the guy in the show sings the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme song to the theme
====================
Eh, doesn't want to play with my friends anymore?
Hey Kyle.
Kyle??
Kyle, you what?!
Kyle, you can't go to the fight!
Kyle, you can't go in there!
Kyle, you can't go in there!  Dude, fiddle roams the Internet like the Internet.
No. I mean it's not just your friends, it's the whole Internet!
Have you guys ever had a hard time getting Internet connectivity?
Pretty much. There's less connectivity from people outside of Africa and Latin America.
What?
What??
Hey, what are you talking about?!
Yeah, lots of guys just can't seem to get Internet connectivity.
What is that?
Yeah, he just got released from Juvenile Hall. He's now got AOL, and it's like nothing there has ever been before.
What is that?
Yeah, dude, pretty much all the world knows that.
Global.Not.That.
What?
Really?
So you're saying that now that he's out of the window, then?
Look, somebody's gotta help him get up there.
Navajo casino.
Oh my God.  This is terrible.
Kyle, you have to keep playing. This is not getting you anywhere.
Just stay still, Dad.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Mom, can I join in?
Yeah, guys.  What's the problem?
I don't know. Me and my friends just came for a playdate.
Dude, what just happened?
What?
...What?
What?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
But why? What did he do to get here?
How can he do that?
But... he doesn't even know John Elway!
He could it?
...Good luck, Kyle.
Yeah. I'm sure Trent knows that too.
Okay, so, how'd you get involved in that stupid gay pride?
Just desserts.
Dude, those are cookies you ate!
Dude! Visitors!
That wasn't a baked-good, Cartman! That was a gaywad!
Visitors!
No, that was okay, but, I feel like all kinds of bad about it.
Visitors are just desserts.  A kind of custard.
That's
====================
Well I guess we can't get back at him.  Maybe he's just too smart to ever be here.
So what do we do now?
What the hell? A stupid list is on a TV show?!
Hey Token.
Are you deaf?
Come on dude, it's not that big a deal.
I don't know, Token. I've been watching Fight Club all day.
You guys are retarded.
This is gonna be so gross.
We'll have Chinpokomon with you
O.K.
' gonna do it Cartman.
This is gonna be so gross.
Ugh.
You guys, are you guys doing the animatronics anymore?
Me neither. I-I can't wait to just be a sniper.
I can't wait to just be a sniper.
You guys, I've been goin' tuh-
Whoa!
...I don't get it dude, my game is shit.
Yeah dude, that's why I have such a hard time getting into school.
Yeah, he's a... a really good skier.
But we're just gonna have to face that the nerding was only for a few days.
Yeah, dude. We'll have to get up there and do our own lesson plan.
Sure.
Oh, good.
Kyle, how'd you get that on your face?
Dude, we're just gonna have to do something.
Kyle, you have to wake up now!
Dude you guys, we got no choice.
It was just a joke. We have to find a way to get back at Cartman for being a little bit funny. Come on!
You guys, we're gonna have to resort to even more witless, more offensive means of communication.
You guys, you have your share of wisecracks, but we're gonna-
Heeyy, do you guys have anything left?
Whoa, dude, we're just passing through.
Look, maybe, maybe we can just drop everything and go back to the first level.
Oh, God-dammit!
We could use some breathing room, dude.
Oh my God.  Jump security.
Okay, here we go.
You dumbass, Cartman.
Yeah, we should probably get a new gun.
Come on, dude.
====================
The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's time for them to get serious.
Well, here we are, Chef. Let's go watch cartoons.
Come on, let's go watch cartoons together.
He does like well past midnight.
He'll do fine.
Okay, he-
God-damnit!
There he is. At least. I, I don't know. He was about to start have sex with my sister.
He does it all with a big plastic ball, and then he slides it into my ass.
Oh God-damnit!
(Sick, dude!)
(Okay, okay, just go away!)
Uh, we're here to find out what the hell he wants to do with my sister.
Yeah.
Dude, it's all set. Now what should we do?
Dude, it's like they know what they're doing.
Maybe we can just leave her alone.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Huh?  Oh yeah.
But there's this snake!
But where did it go?
Huh?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kenny!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Why are you carrying on like that?
Well, I guess you're right.
We can't let Shelly get away with murdering people.
Sh!
Hey, running!
Whatcha doin'?
Well, we need to hurry up. Maybe the snake won't kill us anymore.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Sshh! Beogh!

Now, that's what we call a sloppy business.
Dude, we can't wait.
Chef, you're our friend. Now go, get out of here!
Let's go back to the bus.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Shelly, you have to stop!
Butters, you have to get home and get Chef to come back here.
All right.
Hello? Handler 1?
No.
Dude, there's nothing we can do. We're on our own.
We can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
Chef, we have to go to this big scary monster.
Let's go!
No, we can't talk
====================
Hiya, Sparky! Uh, if you look in the mirror and say "assassination," my dog, Sparky, you go see what he does in the house.
Sparky, don't be such a baby. If I see you in the house again, I will kill you!
If I have to, you guys be the last ones to see my baby.
Hey, look! He's happy!
I don't get it. My dog killed Kenny!
No he didn't, but that's not the point! Those guys are douchebags!
Yeah, Sparky, you need to get some medical help.
What is that?
He needs to eat... at least.
What does he eat, Chef?
Oh, no!
He doesn't know.
Look, dude. Chef is my dog.
He's... different. He's speechless.
Yeah, his head is just stuck out the side of his mouth.
Hey, where's Chef?!
Where's Cartman?!
Oh, Kenny!  Oh to hell with you! You guys!
You guys, I've goobacks!
We said we were gonna make it back to Colorado, but we got a hold of him and he's really mad at us.
We're sooo sorry!
Did you get your wish, Chef? We- we're sooooo sorry.
Can we go back to dog fighting?
We must be jumping too.
Oh my God. Blaise Pascal.
God-dammit, can we please not go back to those bloody bloody long ago?
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
But God, he's a ugly ghost.
I mean, how come they hang on our necks?
pipe, stardust
I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we take down?
Dude, that's not funny.
I want to watch Tom Cruise in a movie with Tom Cruise.
Cartman's a whore, dude, and we spent the weekend hiding him in the basement.
Oh, what a dick.
Of course!
The next day, we went to see him.
Dude, Cruise is obsessed. He even went to Peru to battle this ass-worm.
Oh, what a dick!
I wish Tom Cruise could see what it felt like
====================
Back in the bad side of town!  Come on, wanna go try to make it to the next level?
Come on, Butters.  This place rocks.
It is a long way off, dude. I mean, at least 20 miles an hour coast-to-coast.
Butters, don't go pointing fingers at me.  This is all your fault. My.f-: a ousters.
Oh, they're comin' home.
Hey, we're gonna fight in the basketball game.
This is ridiculous.
Neal Adams was standing right there, watching his brother die.
No, dad, don't.  This is ridiculous.
This is not your head, Dad. This is what happens when you take a giant douche egg and make it to the next level.
But that's not what happened, Mom. The douche egg exploded and landed in the sea, where it is protected from the sunlight by GarageBand.
Butters, we're trying to fish in the Indian Ocean.
Well, we thought to ourselves, "Maybe, maybe not every fish are created equal."
You're right. Maybe, not every fish are created equal.
Look, nan, don't get me wrong. I like your game, but I don't think you have the raw power to make the ultimate fish tank.
What? That's like saying, "Don't call me a pussy."
That's what I would've done. Call her whatever you want, babe.
What?
What?!
You call her pussy, Butters, she's just using her last name.
You should be ashamed of the people who love you but hate you for who you are. But you don't care about the people who hate you. You're just trying to make some money, dude.
Who are the terrorists in Syria?
Who did the baker get the N-word?
Damn, dude.
Who did the baker get an N-word?
We're here!
Dude, the rainforest is only a few hundred years old, dude.
It's the longest day of the year!
Dude, I thought the rainforest was only a few hundred years old!
Come on, Kyle, remember to stay cool!
All right, come on!
Okay, it's all right.  Stop!
Rainforest people, please
====================
The guy who took our friend's kidney said tomorrow night he'll be back.
Hey, Chef.
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Oh, hey Timmy.
Yeah, weird thing is. Maybe, just maybe, Steve Jobs really had something to do with the way we think we dress.
Hey Timmy.
We should have just left him alone. But we just had to push him.
Oh, hey Timmy.
Yeah,  it's pretty cool. A preview of what we've come to expect.
Yeah, it looks like Steve is gonna be famous before he dies!
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
'Scuse me.
Somebody's been stealing Legos from the East Room all night.
Somebody's been doing it for years on end.
But there's no way that kid could've gotten us weaved this much rope.
Dude, it's only gonna get better as the night goes on.
Kyle?  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
Warp drive sequence initiated.
Oh, nothing, dude. Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry I went through all this, you guys just have to do your thing.  Hey Token. Look, I'm really just really just really just really just really just really just really just really really just really just really really.
I'm just, I'm just learning. I'm just, I'm just learning.
I'm just, I'm just a guess- it is, I'm just a guess.
I'm just a guess, an idea for a magazine.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm just a guess, an idea for a magazine.
Look, I'm just a guess, an idea for a magazine.
...And you were-
...Detective Marsh.
I'm askin' you a big favor. I'm gonna do a photo shoot with you.
What?
Oh God-!!
What are you doing, Cartman?
What do you think happens if you do a big photo shoot with the devil.
Butters?
What is the matter with you and with these police?
They just got blindside Castellani out of jail.
Yeah, and then you did a poo in the eye, and I don
====================
We were friends, then.
Yeah, but we never talked to him about it.
Where did he get the puck?
Oh, hey Kyle. What's up?
How come you never told anybody that you were playing for your school team?
We've gotta go to Columbus soon, dude.
Dude, we need to take the bus to Columbus, too.
We wanna go to Columbus soon.
Where's the Governor's office?
Dude, we can't wait.
It's our dads!
We're not your dads, Kyle! We're your friends!
You're not hanging around that fat lady's neck, fatass!
Well fuck you, Cartman! You are no longer a part of our school, Kyle!
We'll have your side of the story, dude!
Dude, you're the one who sent the puck to the stupid-ass Asian country.
Uh, it says you and Kenny went to the richest city in the world.
You're gonna the stupid-ass Asian country?
Oh nah.
Yeah, but, it's not like you're all over there.
What?
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
You guys, get out of here!
You guys, we gotta get this videotape over to the mayor's office.
Yeah, for what.
You see, we thought we were so cool because we got so much attention, but then some people took them ass-fartingly, and we started to think we were so crappy.
We couldn't wait until we were better than the mayor. We have to do something.
Look, we just want something that's real and personal. And we wanna be able to get it to you in time for Halloween.
Of course!
What's the deal with that?
What are you talking about?
I don't know, meh, maybe he's-
Dude, it's Maleficent, and she has this power-up that makes her undetectable.
And what does it say?
What?
Oh my God! They've killed--
They don't want you to see it, dude.
Oh, no! They can't! They just-
 Maleficent knows about your power, right?
So you just- can't tell, dude. They know about mine.
What?
What
====================
The New Yorker's David Blaine has a great rundown of what went down in San Francisco last night.
Who's Captain America?
Dude, why are you so into a cult? What went wrong?
Yeah, dude. It's all your fault.
That's all you've gotta do, dude. Just tell me.
David Blaine?
Do you know why they killed Captain America?
Cool.
What the hell?
Dude, there's nothing you can do.
Kyle, we're not killing Kyle.
It's all right, Kyle.
Mom, you're supposed to make us watch movies and eat broccoli, but this is different. We're learning about the fates of two cultures.
Sshh!
Sorry, dude. We don't like it.
What are you doing, dad? We don't wanna watch films.
Uh, just the news.
Beside, maybe the toilet spat out Cartman's pee.
What?
I don't know.
No, no, we don't wanna watch films.
Just how many movies have you been told to watch this week?
Uhhh, three?
Uhh, Stanley's bunny?
Dude, we can't watch them either.
Jesus Christ.
Dude, are you thinking we should all just go see A Man From the Earth, God?
We can't watch the movies either.
Kyle, you've gotta go to the big screen.
When does the big dance start?
Oh, half an hour into this, I I get it, Butters. I thought you said that the rabbit would come out.
Yyyeah, it's Butters.
I don't get it, dude. It's like, he's chasing me.
Well, I can't see.
No, you don't understand dude, I'm not doing that.
I think Cartman might as well sit there and watch God.
Oh God-!
Kyle, what are you doing?
Kyle, you can't keep doing this, dude. It's starting.
Dude! They're killing Kenny!
Kyle, you have to stop!
It's starting again!  Oh my God, they're killing Kenny!
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Uh, I'm not playing this dolly, Kyle.

====================
I have to remove my camera from Kyle before he can use it against us.
Yyyeah!
Yeah, yeah I see what you're doing, Butters.
Oh yeah? Well, so be it.
Oh, yeah, we've all been so worried about how much money Kyle would take with him that we... don't know what to do.
What's "tooth and nail?"
We'll call you later.
Thanks Kyle.
Uh oh, there's a homeless man in Bentonville, Arkansas.
Kyle, it's exactly what you thought.
God damn it God damn it!
Eehhhehehe!
Kyle, you can't hear that from the people in there?!
Oh, he's a wizard!
He's doing it again in a minute!
Dude, what are you guys doing?
Kyle, you can't hear that from the people in there?!
I wonder how many spells can he cast?
What?
...What?!
Kyle! Du-what!
He's powerless!
Dude, you can't hear that from the people in there?!
What?!
You Kyle, you can't hear that from the people in there!
It's the Chinpokomon kids' show! He's getting his first big break.
I think they've had it with that! (applause)
Today will be Pocahontas' birthday!
They've had it with that!  They've had it with that!
Butters, where are you going?
Well Cartman, you might as well go see that kid again.
Wow, this is going to be so funny!
Well Cartman, you might as well watch the Disney Channel.
Wow, look at all this people. It seems like all those Chinpokomon kids are finally getting their first break.
Hey, Kenny.
Listen, it's just a little revenge on them for not giving us what we wanted.
Yeah, right.
Dude, why would you do that?
Well, Cartman and George Lucas, du-you guys are so badass!
Dude, come on! We gotta find a way to get this Chinpokomon kid back!
Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No, this is gonna get ugly.
Dude, were you guys doing any
====================
Hi. Can we use the bathroom?
Uh, thanks. How are you feeling, Wendy?
Well, it's just a little sore, but not a big deal.
Yeah, well, I just have to get used to it. Kenny says that after this ends, he's gonna kick your ass.
Yeah. Well, I guess I got my period.
Huh? What? Whoawhoawhoa!
Yeah, so it's possible that we were carrying on with our normal business.
But why did they do that?
It's what?
But why?
What does it say?
But why no condoms?
But if there's one thing we learned, it's this. FUsshers are for people of poor or sick sexual health.
We shouldn't have to do this! We can just get out of here!
Well, we can't just go anywhere.
All right, fine.  Okay, let's watch.  And when the fireworks go down, will you go and help Willi-O?
Willie, it's horrible. Willie, it's horrible.
We gotta get Willi-O home.
Thanks a lot, Wendy. You ruined Kyle's crappy life.
What are you talking about?
Shut up, Cartman!
We're sorry. We'll, we'll never help him.
We can't say "We're sorry" okay?
We're sorry!
We're sorry!
Can we just drop the whole "We're sorry" thing?
We're sorry!
Willie, Cartman, are you feeling alright?
Are you sure?
Dude, it's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on us.
Is that so?
God-damnit, is there really anything we can do?
No.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Let's go get the helicopter. We have to make it to the stadium before they all start to shake.
Dude, are we gonna be okay? We have to see the mall?
Remember, the mall is only five miles away.
Go, go, you guys!
Uh, we'd love to, but... it's like, there's no one to help us.
Kyle, you have to-
Dude, it's like everything else... 
They succeed in
====================
Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
Cartman, why are you doing this?
Well, do you know anything about Egyptian philosophy or just wish you could go home?
I just want you to be happy, all right?!
I don't think it's fair for a few greedy corporations to have one great good thing going and then all of a sudden everyone thinks we're all just jealous because we like Dancing Turk better, that we had a bad time and that Dancing Turk is better, that all the other stuff is better, that all the other stuff is just a big headache!
Come on, Kenny, just let Cartman do his thing. He's not doing you anymore.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
They did!
You're gonna read it and see what you think!
It is a long way from your vision, but it is enough to kill Cartman.
Huh?
Yeah, that's not good enough! You have to do the Manga and the Video stuff too, Cartman!
What, dude?
Dude, what a bunch of douchebags.
Hey, I'm Tony Timm.
Who's the boy?
Yeah, he... he's five years old.
Dad, why do you keep saying "baby"?
Mom, I'm tired. I- I can't concentrate anymore.
I don't know.
It's... it's called puberty.
It's what?
But what about Cartman?
But what about Cartman?
Un, I, I don't wanna talk to you.
Pfft.
Yeah, I know.
Look, puberty is something that happens between men and women and it happens between people of different races. A person of Earth, for example, might have a Stark's disease, a Native American disease, and so on.
So what does that mean?
Dude, I don't understand at all.
Wait, what are you talking about?
No, puberty isn't something that happens between people of different races.
But... what should I do with knowledge?
... Understand?
Alright, fine.
Okay, hold it, little guy.
What? But what do I have to do?
What?
Did the Avengers rescue Tony?
That's impossible.  There's no way the world was never meant to end like this.
Mom,
====================
So here we are, 39 years later, and the first black president has been re-elected.
Yeah!
What a dumbass
So let's just do something new this time.
2001: A Space Odyssey?
Oh I'm ready!
 Space pirates?
Yeah!
Dude, these people have tons of space junk in them.
What the hell just happened?
So what did the aliens do to get us here?
Well is what with all the space crap?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe you should go check the toilet.
Okay, then.  Let's get our space hats tuckled.
Yeah, now get your costumes all dirty.
What?
I don't get it.
Dude, I thought underwear are for girls.
I do get it. That's what made me think that, you know, when Nelson Mandela said, "Disgusting," I think you really are a poor, black, woman.
But I don't like it. I, I don't like it at all.
What are you talking about?
No, uhfa-but there's nothing else I can do.
Dude, don't you see what this has done?
Yeah?  See?
And that's when I realized...  WHAT?!
Uh oh.
You're not alone.
Some people have been here already.
Some people have been here already.
Some people.
Some people have been here already.
So you need to help those in need, too!
That's what I was thinking.
But why? What does it say?
...and then you go and help people in need, too?
Oops.
Maybe they're pirates on their phone.
What happens if there's a power cut?
When the TV show Captain America: Civil War finishes, we'll have new episodes.
You working with Captain America?
...So that would be "The Vision? Our friend is being blamed for a lot of things?"
That's not true!  That's what they say!
Way to go, Uncle Jimbo!
You're right, Aunt Clarisse! When you were a little boy, you didn't understand that sometimes talking to a pig was something you could do!
Huh?
...And that's why Cartman got himself a pig.
No, Uncle
====================
Oh come on guys. It's just a show! They don't care about the rest of us!
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what the world is about. All this money, all this violence makes Nigeria great. But what makes it so great is that, when people talk about "rescuing" resources, they aren't actually talking about violence.  People talk about eco-terrorists and stuff.
This is a great show, but, are we gonna get along?
What are you talking about?
What?
These people trying to kill us!
Nah, I saw all those movies.
Nah, I've been watching all my life. But... I don't remember seeing "The Passion."
What?
Oh, that's "The Passion" by George C. Scott?
The gingers and celebrities all want to kill Kenny.
No, it was a great time.
Whoa, dude, I don't think there's anything "trendy."
Yeah, let's look for him in the forest.
What?
Yeah, dude, I wonder why "The Passion" was so good.
Cartman, no!
What?
Oh, you guys are actors, then why aren't you playing Bill Payne?
I don't know. One of the directors said they wanted to do a scene with Cartman.
Oh, hey, how's it going?
Yeah, "The Passion."
Do you think they were really trying to set up the video?
Sounds pretty good.
Kyle, we shot the video yourself.
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to.
Wh-what is this?
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
You've gotta tell them to stop shooting eggs!
I don't know, dude. I'm supposed to make a beeline for the end of the world.
But what do you expect?
She's just trying to make us feel bad for her.
Cartman, you idiot!
What is that?
What the hell?
She couldn't fly with a kitchen knife, right?
Cartman, you've gotta understand something about the eggs rule!
I don't take food stamps! Those are fake news!
But you guys are just lying to me, Kyle!
What is "The Passion" about?
What about the
====================
Look, I understand that you're a big fatass, but, being a big fatass, I... I don't understand.
How can you say that sis when you're wearing a bracelet?
Uh-oh.
Alright, I'm gonna buy you something.
Okay, I'm gonna do it for you.
What?
You've got to give me my bracelet, man.
You've got to give me my bracelet, man.
Oh...
I didn't know that.
Jesus Christ...
Aw, dude, I need to go to bed.
Yeah, why don't you just tell Cartman to get up and leave me alone?
Well... I just wanted to tell you, dude. I know I know everything about the last person you've talked to.
You don't understand. You're a LITTLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE BLE.
Just a cruel joke. Bebe's life is in the news, and... she's about to give birth to her biggest shock of the year so far to her big brother. ...So, what are we supposed to do?
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the bitchiest kid in the country.
Huh?
...Hooray! Uh-... hello there, Wendy!
Wendy, it's- it's me,
ヴォックス, ォックスルー!
Hey, could I talk to you for a second?
Wendy, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just can't seem to get to the bottom of this.
Well, what do you think, Kyle?
I don't think so, fuck you.
What happened?
Yeah, I know a lot of you are sick.
Where did you go, Kyle?
...Bleech!
Bleech!
Hey, where did you go, Kyle?
Where did you go, Kyle?
Bleech!
Bleech!
Hey, where did you go, Kyle?
Hey, where did you go, Cartman?
Hey, where did you go, Kyle?
Hey, Where Did We Get This?
Oh, well.  There's gotta be somethin' about Phillip Dan by the way.
Yeah, he's cool.
Dan is in his clubhouse playing
====================
I'm ready!
I'm ready to go to the mall!
Yeah!
Mom, I'm sure that if I stayed here long enough, they could break in here and take me to the mall.
Yeah, but can they?
I don't think so.
Mom, I was just trying to save money.
Yeah, but can they do that?
I think so.
But if they have no other choice, I don't think I'd stay here.
It's my favorite toy.
Oh.
Oh hey Dad.  How's it going?
Yeah, I should have told you that.
Ah hi. I'm you, me and Barkat came up with the idea for the show.
We make all the rules, but you and I have to figure out how to win.
We said we wanted to win a costume contest for the entire world to see.
See? We both play the same sound system.
One word, twin words. English isn't its own language.
We both play the same music.
We both love and hate Barkat.
But English isn't its own language, it's what we call English speech.
We're both trying to say "Hello" to the world.
AAAAAAAA!
AAAAAAAA!
That's a good idea!
But we have to tell the world what we want
So put that to rest! We will fight for what we want!
Wendy, we've been waiting for hours!
Hey look! There's a bunch of people!
Mom, Dad? Are you and Wendy married?
We're not the same person.  We're just people trying to say the world is a better place.  We're just trying to say hello to a lot of a a-n't oh-nothin' about a. Thou and I are married.
What?
We've trying!
Why don't you guys just tell the truth?
You know what we're all about?
You're gonna get away with this, dude!
The truth is, we all got screwed ups. And now, we need to take care of that!
What?
Whoa whoa wait, w-what did you get into this for?
Yeah, they were gonna put ketchup on cars to make it seem like they had a lot of fun?
Who?  This
====================
Oh, really?
...Then I'll just tell you one thing: nobody likes having to work so hard to be rich.
You know, I've come to realize that just because somebody is born with great potential, doesn't mean they have to suck it up and do whatever's right for them.
Look, there's nothing more I can do. Kyle is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?
Awgh! I'll make you bring it over!
Oh, brother!
What?
Yeah, here's your ticket. Uh, if you want to, you know, get a haircut and... live a normal life, then... get a job!
Okay, uh, thanks.
Cool, everything's fine, okay?
What's a dildo?
Thanks for everything, Wendy!
All right, fine, let's go watch Terrance & Phillip.
Well, it's just a big stupid movie now.
Oh, not that.
z' hurry, dude!
Jesus, is it so you just go at least 20 steps?
Oh, you mean, you have this dildo, dude?
Dude, the way you're stimulating it, that's like... saying "Pizza" to somebody.
Guys, guys, guys, stop!  You guys, guys!  You guys! Are you totally retarded?
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
I can't believe it.
Yeah, me too.
Sure, me too, Kenny.
What?
Yeah, I'll vote you all back if I get to do it, me and Kenny.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
I'm so sick of hearing this stuff! Everyone hates me!
Well, what about the bigoted homosexual? He's my sister, after all.
He's what??
But Wendy, is that you?
Really? Then everyone is gonna understand?
Yeah, you know what? That's what matters.  People gonna understand that homosexual acts don't have to be condemned just because they're meant to be homosexual.
I guess, but... Butters, are you going to destroy all these religions?
I wish I could understand this all now.
...What?
I don't understand at all. You're a dick and I're a
====================
Alright, guys, we're gonna play ball. You've gotta come and see us.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, they're shooting at least one video.
See what?
No.
You mean the video games were not harmed in any way, and that they're just making movies about violence and transgression?
Shhh!
No! I mean, Lopez was kind of quiet after all.
Hey, what's up?
Uh huh... Hey, what's happen?
What?!
Oh, hey Dad.
I know. I was told to stay here and talk to Dad.
...What?
You've got to be kidding.
Dad, haven't you seen the stuff Cartman is doing?
Does this mean Jared's not here for the big party?
Shes, the big party is just about to start.
What are you talking about?
Come on, we gotta go check on him.
Do you think he's happy there?
We think so.
Come on, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
JaredLopez@Gmail.com
Oh, gosh, gosh, it's all right.
Thanks.
Oh, thank God.
Eric, is Jared still at that party?
Do you think that's enough to get him to pay attention to Wendy?
Do you think they found out what Kyle really wanted to do?
Yeah, they're here.
You guys! Check out these other kids' parties.
Yeah, I think they're cool.
Do you guys realize what this? This is just a show! It's not like it's any more and all the other kids are gonna be at their parties all day long!
It's not?
Oh, dude, not cool. Kyle and I are gonna do whatever it takes to get to this party.
Guys, guys, guys, stop!
Guys, guys, stop!
Guys, guys,  NOW!
You guys, guys, stop!
Hey, can you just drop everything and come back to us?
No, dude, we never even saw it!
Were you listening, Kyle?
Where are you going?
So? What are you going to do now?
They're gonna destroy all of Minecraft?
Goddamnit, you can't read this!
It's all
====================
Hi there, Uncle Jimbo.
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo was the first Indian to live in Africa.
He was just over there.
Okay, it's pretty cool, Cartman.
Hey, look!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, Mom, haven't you got what it takes?!
Stan, I'm getting on it. Why don't you just tell the Indian heads that we have a problem?!
"Island Of Misfit Mascots".  "Island Of Misfit Mascots". Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Dad, that's just gross.
No, Dad, that's just gross!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Cartman, you can't leave me here; what have you done with my stupid TV?
What??
Does this mean we have to go to the movies?
Dude, we just can't anywhere.
Mom, will you take care of everything, Uncle Jimbo?
...Okay.
Uh-oh.
Phillip?
These Indians are tough as nails, but they'll never kill you.
They're here! Hurry and hide!
They're here!
They chased us out of the house.
Oh yeah? They're here!
They chased us out of the house.
Oh yeah? They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Yeah, I'd like to live with this misery.
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here!
Oh, yeah! They're here
====================
Dude, you're the one who cut off his hand.
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and cutting off your hand, but we're not!
Ah, hold on. Did you bring the movie?
Dude, we didn't know what we were doing.
Alright, where's the money?
Yeah, fight or flight.
Uh, what do we want?
Dude, we're playing dodgeball.
Grampa??
Don't be such a pussy, Cartman! We're playing dodgeball!
You're a pussy, Cartman!
Why do we have to do this, Mom?
All right, fine, let's just play dodgeball.
Dude, we just can't seem to find the right spot.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
All right, do we sound like the first ones here?
Maybe it is?
Where are they?
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with it.
It's a mask and a tooth, Kenny.
Cartman! You can't believe that shit.
Oh God-dammit, fire!
Everyone running away!
Hey, fireman! We found a way to get everyone out of the heat of battle.
Well, we can't let them do it. We have to find a way out!
All right, we just need one more person to protect the galaxy from the Evil Cartman.
All right, come on, guys.
Goddamnit, what the hell do we do?
Do you know how many times we both got in this dude's way!
Good. So now we just try to sleep at night.
All right, guys, over here.
Okay, we gotta find a way out.
Well, we just got trapped on an ice planet and, we...
No!
I don't know.
All right, all right, screw it! We have to find a way out!
No cloud city, not cool.
Whoa, cool.
* Come on, guys.
What is that?
Hey, what's the Black Death?
Okay, I'll try to make it happen.
Roy has a dial-up connection, remember?
Tell it to me, Roy. I'll get it.
All right, come on, guys.
It's just for show
====================
I am... totally miserable. I feel like total shit.
Can we just talk about the actual whaling? It's just got more and more outrageous.
Well, the whole thing is a big fat lie. Look, there's no way we're making any money.
Hey, isn't that Jimbo?
Hey, hey, what are you doing?!
chipmunks@me.com
Yeah, yeah, we are!
Hurry up, stupid stupid hell!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Cartman, you idiot!
What the hell is going on?
Jesus Christ.
Oh Jesus Christ!
Wendy, there's a health crisis going on and she's gonna be the first woman on TV.
Wendy, look!
Dude, just let me get this straight: there's no way we're not gonna win this Christmas, okay?
Dude, Christmas is over. We didn't even know Christmas was over.
We can't spend Christmas with cheesy commercials! We've gotta spend Christmas with better technology!
Bluuuuch!
Hey, hey, what are you doing?!
That's a sweet idea!
But the big dance is about to begin!
Hey, Christmas is here and we can't wait.
...What?
Bluuch.
Butters, what the hell is going on this time?!
Wait, it's not like we were kids!
Kenny says that once you get to the top you learn to dance.
Yyeah, you little ass-sucker.
We can't spend Christmas with cheesy commercials!
He's saying that once you get to the top you learn to dance.
You what you're gonna call me after you get to the bottom of this!
I'm not gonna look at cheesy commercials! I saw one recently where they had somebody dance like a girl until they were dead!
Chef, I have a picture of you and my uncle Melvins' kid.
What?
They're both look-alike people from Jersey.
Yeah dude, where's Kenny?
Then you must be Trenton.
What the hell is he doing?
He's doing a show in New York City. I'll be there.
He was here first.
Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
Where's Kenny?
A what?
Hey,
====================
Yeah I know, I know... Butters said he's got a big problem in his family right now, and he wants to get help from somebody.
No, not the one in Cartman's cell. I'm talking about Kyle.
Mom! Dad, Timmy's up there with these Cartman's kids!
Come on, guys, we're going to Malibu too.
Yeah, stop it.
That's my house. I can keep them all.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I just, I can't believe that crazy pope.
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up.
Hey, there's a bunch of people now. Talk to you tomorrow!
Hey, mistaken identityanity!
Hey, we're the followers of St. John Paul II!
I baptized you guys. It was the Catholic church that was wrong!
Uh, we were just trying to save the world!
Yeah, so how do you know?
Oh, there's a guy named John that's been baptized in a country church. He's supposed to be helping somebody in need in South Park.
Well, we tried all this on Father John, and it worked.
Now, that's a Catholic church!
Why did they do that?
Well, what do you mean?
Alright, let's try it again. Hup!
What was that?
Indiana Jones?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You guys, maybe this all isn't our thing.
Cartman, please. We have to study.
Dude, this is all so fucked up.
Maybe we were wrong about the title.
Huh? Why do we have to study?
Um, Henry, don't you know what this means?
Yeah, maybe we were wrong about the whole "you're not gonna be as good as you think" thing, and now we need to study.
What?
Butters, open the door!
What was that?
Dude, this is just horrible!
But we don't have any other choice.
Come on, let's go!
No, we aren't coming back here.
Dude, let's just stop watching news and go to bed.
What?
You guys! Get up!
Eric, are you still asleep?
What?!
Eric, are you still asleep
====================
It's got to be quintuplets! They deserve something!
Yeah dude, they should just be happy.
Yeah, why should we all care about quintuplets? We get to go to Scotland and... eat bacon.
Yeah, that'd be funny.
I wouldn't care.
Oh my God.
Choirs are just as much a part of my life as a DVD player is of mine. I can't wait to finish my education.
Huh?
...fin' up my period'
Yeah, what's boring about that?
Dude, video games are just that!  It's just something you do all the time. You keep playing, and eventually you get to a point where you don't care about the game at all.
You guys! Game over!
You guys, Reggie and Kenny!
We have to play!
We're not going to school on Monday!
We're not leaving any time like the hour!
Calm down guys, we have to get into the weekend!
What?
We can't care less!
Rescue us!
We gotta get to a school early!
A-and we gotta go find us a way!
We gotta book an overnight stay, Kyle!
I'm not taking you guys on a bunch of shooting 'N Sync!
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's the greatest!
Well of course you don't understand! My dad can't handle the thought of you all coming to his house and laughing all over the place!
Yeah it's stupid. I'm not gonna have you come back.
Leaving a 4-year-old son without any injuries seems like it would be the new normal.
What?
...Well, at least you're not gonna have your own circus!
Where?
Yeah, where is ringing the alarm.
All right!
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly.  We're not gonna be able to leave any more of the four of us.
Okay.
Mom, Dad, the bus is about to leave.
What?
Oh my God. They've killed Kenny!
Mom, Dad, the bus is about to leave.
It's just a stupid accident, Dad. You didn't hurt either of us.
We're going home.
Hey,
====================
I think the key to getting Harbucks to give us our money back is to just leave him alone.
What??
Okay, so where's the money?
He's just happy to be back here.
Yeah, it's nice.
Thanks a lot, Kyle.
I don't think you guys want to play.
Come on, let's do this.
It seems like everyone has their own version of events.
Pretty far gone, that?! Where's the money?!
Butters!  Let's get to the roof!
Hay, you can't go back here!
Kenny's right. We have to find a way to get the money back. We're trying to do too much, to too little.
Too much of what? That's what you guys are all trying to do.
Hay, we have to do something!
Kenny, please take us to the roof!
No! We have to go down!
Gooooooo!
Gooooooo!
It's the sound of wood filling the room.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
...What?
Yeah, but we don't know what that is.
Alright, let's ditch school and go find the money.
You dad can't go to the movies, do you?
Dude, we gotta find some other money.
Dude, we can't do anything for hours.
Dude, we're not making any more money.
You know, Cartman is.
How come you never told anybody that the whale you were eating was killed and the sewage had rung up in your nose?
And then you got a piercingly bad nose and it was like--
Man, do we wish--
Wendy, where are you and Santa get along?
The whales deserve it more than we deserve them.
Shut up, Cartman.
What the hell?
We're trying to save some innocent little baby whales.
You know, Santa did a couple of hundred films, and--
Butters, where are the whales supposed to get toys, too?
Parents suck whales' blood
Then where's the line??
They want your toothbrushes.
We can't let those whales get to you.
I think Santa got us there, or else--
Wait a minute. That's it?
Aww, he's--

====================
Well, it looks like Dad's not gonna be around for a while.
Hey, where's Cartman?
Whoa, dude!
You're a goner, douchebag!
Hey, you're goner, douchebag!
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment, is that okay?
What are you talking about, Cartman?
Yeah.
Cool!
Hey, I love Mr. Jefferson.
I know, dude. I love Mr. Jefferson.
Yeah. You know, I think the Civil War was a great time to be a Civil War Trapper Keeper.
Oh, hey, there's talk of you and I and Cartman are gonna become couples.
Well, I guess not being married and starting a business are no big deal.
What's going on?
...What?
What?
It's called futility.
Sooo, get a lot of the news, dude.
We got a new coach, Craig, and Kyle's dad is in jail.
Dude, we gotta go check on him.
Yeah, but...
Kyle, don't be such a pussy.
Be quiet, dude. I called Kyle.
Whoa.
Dude, I don't think the government is really happy with you.
Whatever.
Whatever, dude. I'll show you. I'm just a convenience to be on the go.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman's butt!
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude!
Kenny's bullcrap.
Dude, be quiet, dude. I want to be in Cartman's camp.
Cool, dude. I mean, at least, that's what the big reunion is about.
Dude, be quiet, dude. I want to be in Cartman's camp.
Cool.
Dude, just, be quiet, dude. I mean, at least, be in Cartman's camp and be in bed with your mom.
Shut up, Cartman.
Dude, just be quiet, dude. I don't care.
Kyle, you have to be in Cartman's camp to do this.
Ow!
Yeah, cool. I'll see you later, Cartman.
As if that wasn't enough,
====================
This book is just a big fat global scam!
Who is that?
Yeah dude, he's scary.
Dude, who the hell wants to read that stuff about Jared Collins and rendered in a scary, strange, foreign light?
Look, it isn't my idea to start with foreign words and work our way up! All I want to do is make everything Japanese in this book work!!
There's nothing funny about that!
What?
Look, uh, hoo, hoo. Look!  Just, just a little.
Yeah, whatever.
This is a travesty.
There's nothing funny about that.
What?
Look, uh, I mean, he's a big fatass, but, but you're a big fatass, and so are your French friends, and, and now you're a douche!
I'm not saying don't go to France! Being a douche means you're a douche, and so are you French friends! I'm just saying that if you were a douche, you'd be bumming me out.
What?
Awww!
I'm not bumming you out douche!
Okay. Ready, you can add "to list" to your keyboard.
Hey it looks like everyone's cool now.
What's that?
Uh yeah, I might be bumming everyone out of my club up ahead.
It's just a list. I didn't wanna start a fuss.
...No.
 add a few more names, please.
Okay, I'm not bumming anybody out add a few more names, please.
Okay, add another list about Afghanistan, please.
Yes, I'm sorry, Imtude, I didn't mean to.
Yes, I'm sorry, I'll be back as soon as I can.
Hello?
No, no, no, I've been kicked out of Club B.
Oh hey guys, uh... I was told to get back at the parents?
Look, I'm sorry I had to leave you guys wanting.
It's just a list, you guys. I can't guarantee it.
A certain Tweek put on a show all weekend and we're still not heard of for sale.
He or she kicked the crap out of everybody and now we're never heard of again.
We're not gonna get any attention
====================
Oh yeah, we can change the channel.
Thanks.
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Who the fuck is is, Kyle?
No.
He's a really fun party-goer.
I don't want to go on his adventures, fatass!
How can we split up?
What?
Sylverster Stallone said so.
Jesus. Stallone said so.
Sylverster Stallone said so.
Sylver...
Hey. Where's Kenny?
Uh, hey Dad.
That's better.
No Dad, that's better.
Son of a bitch!
Yeah!
Why do we even wanna get to that?
Kenny's a perv!
No, Dad, that's not cool.
Do you know how many times Kenny rhymed in class?
He did it once?
Dad, how many times have you told all this crap to everybody that you're a fatter girl?
That's not in the script!
That's not in the script at all!
Chef, is there anything you wanna tell all this other shit about Kenny?
I don't think it's fair for a third party to make money off of a lip balm.
You're a pussy!
What's the question?
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time.
Dude, that's not cool.
Yeah, Cartman's not even a pussy.
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny.
What the fuck?
I like it.
It mirrors your pussy.
Wet, huh? It's been getting really hot lately.
Yeah, I think Kenny's eskimos are just as good.
Nice job, Cartman.
I think we're onto us.
Kenny'd better shut up, dude.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Not really.
No, dude. Not many people get to do it.
Do you think they're money suckers?
Do you think they're so hard-pressed to get by now?
That's your mind, Cartman?
What the hell is going on?
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on anybody!
Kidney Blocker 2000?!
Alright,
====================
We're trying to find those Native Americans, but they're not answering any of your questions.
We think it's important that they be told the truth, otherwise they'll destroy us all.
Help you, dude!
Excuse me, we wanna talk to you about the show.
Uh, well, I mean, we all want to understand what's going on but,... at the same time, it's just... I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense.
Excuse me, please.
There's another Native American burial place, and... there's a man named George Washington, and he's the son of the great American.
So, we have to find him, please.
Mom, Dad, are you sure they have him?
They're not in a very nice mood.
Oh, well. Maybe we should go and visit.
NO.
Dude, we can't go anywhere.
No, dude, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
What are you talking about, dude?
Yeah, a lot of Native Americans today are totally messed up, like us.
The hell do you think we gonna do?
Dude, we don't even know what'll happen.
Kyle, maybe we should go see the Native Americans.
Dude, they're just trying to make their town go away.
Come on, let's go.
Where's the phone book?
What?
Kyle, you've gotta tell us how to get that book.
How do you know?
Oh, uh where do you have the locker?
Oh, oh okay, I'll give you my book.
What?
Cartman, seriously, you've gotta tell us how to get that brown plastic bagpipe.
How do you know?
Oh, they're from the Native American tribes.
We know, we know what you're about to find out.
It is dear, Your Highness, we are friends with none other than the Native Americans.
They're good people, but they're just kids, like us.
We've tried. &c., rootbeerman
Yeah, and why do you think they wanna destroy your town?
Why?
Well it's all the Native Americans doing.
Yeah, and you know what else is going on?
Nah, I think Cartman's right. The Native Americans
====================
A preview of the new season of Homeland?
We love you, Dan!
Oh, thank you, Homeland's mastermind, and now you have to be kidding me.
Who was that?
Dude, they're gonna be here any second.
Whoa!
Hey, you guys! How come Homeland can be so funny?
Can't we just be like normal Americans?
The director of Homeland Security John Pistole has been arrested and charged with three counts of CityFoolings.
Oh my God.
We're gonna watch & play!
You're a pussy!
Put your hands up, asshole!
Oh, he's taking pictures!
You're a pussy too, man!
Open the door, Homeland! We're gonna watch & play your show at the mall tomorrow!
Yeah, dude, we'll pay you for them.
Hey, what's going on?
Jesus, we did that!
Dude, we've got to get out!
Dude, we've got to get out!
owl?
Oh thanks, dude.
No problems, dude.
Dude, I wonder what was going on in those bank statements.
What did the managers do to get those withdrawals?
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Well, what does it say?
Dude, I want to borrow the money from that stripper.
What?
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna go to Kyle's house.
Dude, I don't know what to do.
Come on, dude, it's not that big a deal.
What is that?
Whoa, dude!
You didn't know, Cartman!
Dude, it's Ms. Ellen DeGeneres who offers her wisdom and help!
I'm trying to go to my parents, dude. I, I can't really concentrate.
Dude, I don't understand at all.
Come on, dude, it's not that big a deal.
Dude, I don't drink beer.
No, dude, I Vic- I don't get enough water.
Dude, I don't smoke pot. I don't eat broccoli.
I don't go to church. I don't follow all the pope does.
But dude, I vote.
Did you know your mom could become a nun?
Yeah, that's the
====================
We should all take a stand and demand that Big Gay Ride is banned from all playgrounds!
We demand that this playground superintendent be banned from all playgrounds!
The Big Gay Ride is great, but we have to be really nice to the other kids.
No, we can't do that! We've just got too busy trying to make ends meet!
Wow, that sucks, dude.
No, we can't!
The other kids are gonna get their principal and principal is a total bitch!
Okay, so then let's just keep this.  This is great, because the other kids are gonna get their principal and then we can take over the world!
God-damnit, this is pretty sweet.
Yeah, isn't that a lot like it?
Really?
Dude, that's not K-On.
Dude, that's not Phillip.
What is this place?
Alright, I'm going to the sea man's cave.
Where?
Yeah, dude, where is that Stingrays?
I have no idea.
We've gotta swim over them or else we're gonna die.
I, I can't, I can't see.
Oh-hoho!
Yeah, that's right!
Cartman, just keep running.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! This place is huge and, dare I say it, I can't tell you the name of any of the people who live and breathe here!
Holy crap.
Hey hey Cartman. How come the sea men keep coming in?
What do they eat?
Yeah, seafood.
Wow, you're smart, dude. Sea cows are smart, too.
Hey, hey, you've got to do something!
Why does everyone suddenly have to work so hard to make ends meet?
I don't get it. We're not making any more money.
I don't get it.
U-uh, yeah. We're just gonna have to depend on you.
That isn't true. I have a great-grandpa. He pays us to write songs.
Yeah, and I don't think that's stopping the people from making tons of money.
Yeah. Why?
Where are you going?
Why?
So, the sea people built this thing that makes tuna and bacon?
Yeah, and so too do we!
====================
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to find out what happened to your friend.
I don't know, it's really weird.
Maybe there's a way for somebody to resurrect him.
No, no, I'm asking the priest what happened to your friend are are those forces that killed him?
Cartman?? What the hell are you doing, Kyle?!
Whoa, what have you!
Dude, change the channel. That's no coolger than Constantine.
Excuse me, why are you doing this, Constantine?
Hey, look!
Cartman, you did great, you know. Thanks to you, my friend, it's not that big a deal.
I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this, Butters.
I'll be there, Butters.
Dad? Dad, what are you doing?
Yeah, that's not funny.
Do you think he's ever going to come back to this bad?
Well, you know, he's a big fatass, so maybe we can't get on with the fun.
What are you talking about?
No, dad, that's not cool.
Hey, Dad, why are you doing this?
Yeah, why are you so obsessed with that fat chick's life?
...Really?
Dude, that's not cool.
Look, fatass. Talk to her.
What?
Talk to her.  This is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that skinny, fit, septic-tube-free Harrison from the doctor in New York.
And that's $(#$%) is not to say "shit" or "fuck" anything. It's just to say "shit!"
'Cause you said it, you said it, you said it.
You guys are so full of shit right now!
Not gonna take life out of my friend!
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Yeah, give him a whack.  Hey, dude, give me the whack!
Give me the whack, Cartman!  No, you can't do that!
Dude, she's weak.
What kind of warm body does Kenny is he?
Notky-Godzilla!
Who's That?
Dude, you're the
====================
Dude, I really don't care.
Ow!
Yeah!
Fine! Go tell your parents!"
"You have to tell your parents," Dad said, "that they're not listening to you. They're just ignoring you. Screw you, Dad, go tell your parents.
They're not listening to you, you fucking idiot!
Mom?  Whoa, dude!
Mom, do you think your family is so stupid that they don't realize that Big GayGorgerThanUs is actually a joke?!
They're not listening to you, Big GayGorgerThanUs! He's a real whack.
Hey, kid, what are you doing?
What do you say?
What are you doing with your life, gaygender?
What?!
What are you doing?
I'm not depressed, I just feel that way because of you guys. I'm feeling really good, and I don't wanna feel like doing more chores.
Oh no, what now?
Eric? My new friend, Big GayGorgerThanUs.
He's the greatest. He's the one that convinced me to stay and help him raise his money.
I'll be back. Thank you.
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your cancer.
My dad said you didn't wanna be depressed, fatass.
Really?
Wow, you are such a big fatass, dude.
Well, I guess I'm sorry I was ignoring you.
Hello?
I is, my name is Stan.
You all right, fine, fatass?
Well, I guess we can't put a stop to this we'll see you later.
Well sure, you can all go see Hulk Hogan's mom at the mall.
She's locked in the back.
Hey, can you just hide?
You all right?
Dude, this is really weird.
No no, he's not gonna quit.
Yeah, what do we do?
We can't let her die, dude.
Let's get back to the room.
Oh, no!
Mr. Huggins' room is now his favorite room.
Oh, hey Dad.
Listen, you guys. We need to talk about something a little more serious. You know, like, how come all these accidents this
====================
Ugh.
I don't know where this is going.
Kyle! You guys can't keep track of where Cartman and Kyle are! We're never gonna find them!
Where are they?
Hey daffy!
Dude, where are you going?!
Oh, hey Kyle.
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Oh ooh.
Cartman's a nice, small boy. You know, he doesn't mean to annoy you.
What the hell is wrong with Cartman?
'Scuse me. I wanna talk to you about this 'grampa thing'.
All right, the grampa thing is this Indian burial ground. You seeing it now, you can tell it's really important.
But the real story is... is that of the fifth graders.  It was a false flag operation.
We were trying to warn the government in Denver about North Korea.
But then the nukes went in, and it became a talking point for everybody.
All right, I'm gonna try to track down that fifth grader now.
Hey, he said that the pope's meeting with the fifth graders would be happening so this was a way for us to tell them the truth.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. Tonight is the fifth grade means you're supposed to be telling the truth.
Today is supposed to be about the summer.
What happened?
Yeah, so why don't you go see them?
Parents?
Conservatives are gonna hell if they don't give up!
I don't believe it!
Well it looks like the fifth graders' resurrurence is going to be one big treat.
Yeah, let's go watch Terrance & Phillip at the local mall.
What's the quintuplet doing in there?
Well, Cartman's not a big fan of being pulverized, so, could you just kind of... suck the blood out of him like he was in there?
Well, I guess we'll see what happens to his soul.
Ugh, dude, I'm gonna be dead before they find out.
I don't wanna watch this, Kyle. I'm gonna be watching Terrance & Phillip.
What the hell is he doing?
Whoa, dude, I don't get it.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

====================
Hey guys,
It looks like the Evil Cartman is about to fire off a new round of revenge on our parents.
Cartman! Cartman! Kidman, you have to stop!
But the big dance is tomorrow and we still do not have our costumes.
Oh no, dude, Cartman, you can't keep torturing yourself like I did.
What?
Butters, don't you have guts? We have to do this together.
We have to get our costumes back. Then we can go play video games.
H-Dad, what the hell is going on?
LEGITURE?
For what?
Butters, you deserve it more than that!
You guys! Sorry, dude, you can't do this!
What the hell?
Kenny?! You guys, let's get out of here!
No, you can't even leave the bleachers.
(Sick, dude!)
(Okay, okay, just go away!)
Uh. We've been getting-
All right, alright, let's get out of here, and then we'll go back to the bleachers.
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get a haircut and a tux.
Kyle, do you wanna go back to playing Guitar Hero with your friends?
That's not in the script!
That's wrong dude, that's what's happening.
Ticket information has been sold out.
Hey, wait, what are you guys doing?
What's going on?
...Like Christopher Reeve's character in Christopher Reeve in The Lord of the Rings.
Whoa.
Man, this is scary.
Dude, it's pretty cool.
What, exactly, is wrong with that guy?
Cartman, can you just get on the plane home?
He'll do it really nice, dude.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Kind of pissed off the people who want to stay in Colorado.
And that makes him the perfect candidate to go to San Francisco.
Hey, we appreciate your help, Tweek.
No, that's too extreme.
Okay, let's just get out of here.
Thank you.  Aaaah ha, that's not cool.
Hey, you can't do that.
Tweek?
Okay.
Here they come.
Hey, we
====================
Well obviously, it's not working.
Yeah dude, it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
Hiya, Sparky.
I'm not firecracker. I spray paint on the walls and then they put me in charge of Sparky.
Sparky, I'm in charge of Sparky.
I don't know!
Jesus Christ!
Kyle, don't say "Hail Mary!"!
Holy crap dude!
Uh oh, it's Kenny who was in the kitchen with you.
Mom! Death!
Now, Kenny!
What the hell is his problem?
Now, Kenny!
Kenny??
What the hell is he doing?
Well, I'm gonna go to the kitchen and grab some food.
Mom, I'm sorry I went to the store. I had to go in the lobby.
Sshh! Come on, Dad!
What is he doing?
Oh, he's a help!
Dude, I have to get help from God!
He's going to kill my parents.
Okay, so, how's your fire?
They're still open.
Thanks.
Jesus Christ!
Wow, it's really cool!
Dude, Kenny's still alive and he's trying to save us!
But it looks like he's got a plan.
Hey, can you just come get us 'em?
Sweet! Kiss them!
Hey, can you just come get 'em?
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Hey, we're good!
They want to take our jobs.
We're the ones who lost our jobs.
Hey, we didn't break a million points and we want to work for a corporate powerhouse again!
Thanks.
I don't know, you guys. I'm sure we'd like to keep trying.
I don't like it. It's like, it doesn't really matter what choices you make.
You're making me sick.
It's not my fault!
I don't want my job back!
You're right. Maybe, just maybe, there's nothing we can do.
IGNORE.
You're right. Well, anyway, I have to now unlock the Melvinist Wing. I need you to help me unlock it.
You mean, the Wing is run by Melvinists?
Oh, hey guys
====================
nothing
I'll get in trouble.
But what about the rest of us?
JUST FOR SIN!
For what?!
Dude, when can we get in trouble for "insulting" somebody else?
No, dude, no. We don't understand how that word can have such a strong and abiding meaning.
You mean, we share a room together?
That's not pencil-ticking.
Not cool. This is dangerous.
You're using a dead body.
Yeah, that's not weird. You're not using a dead body to describe somebody you're just saying they're attracted to people who share a room.
How do you feel, Mr. Mackey?
Okay.
They're staying with the same building.
What the hell just happened?
Yeah, when did we do all this?
Where did it go?
Dude, who the hell wants to play Call of Duty?
You guys! Check it out!
We can go back to the dorm now!
Come on, guys!
Of course! We want our costumes and paraphernalia!
Kenny's right. We've had a lot of calls from our parents and friends asking them to bring us their costumes, but if we don't get our costumes ready for GameSphere, we can't play the game!
Kyle, if you look in the mirror, you'll see that your face is got lots of spit on it.
Dude, where's our costumes?
What?
Yeah, where's our Pikachu outfits?
Where?!
Pokoro!
Cartman!
Hey Terrance!
Hey Kenny!
It's Terrance! Hey, hey, wait for it.  We forgot our costume code. It's not our fault!
Oh, hey, you're not gonna tell on me, Cartman!
What are you talking about?
Kenny! You guys, we forgot our costume code for POKONO!
We've been through a lot, but, you guys can say your story is really good.
'Cause you forgot and I'm not!
Can we go to the next level, please?
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you were able to level all the way through to the next level.
Kyle, you guys forgot your costume, right?
Dude, for what?

====================
Kyle!
Damn, dude.
Wow dude, your mom's a perv and your dad's a dick.
Dude, what if one day your mom finds your stuff and starts ripping on you all the time?
Kyle, we're not saying Cartman sucks, we're saying that Kyle is showing signs of... "Dare"!
Cartman, NO!
Tell her it's because he's a Native American.
No, that it cost him his life.
...What?
Kyle, you have to keep going.
You're not staying the course, dude. One of the co-ed students told us you were in love with Cartman.
And... Kyle and Cartman have been having an apparently happy couple for some time.
When Kyle and Cartman got married, they had a gathering of strippers.
Then that was when they went bust.
But that was when they had nightmares.
Feelin' good on a Sunday,
I'm in a relationship with this Miss Universe Pageant at school.
What?
We're not getting on in any way, shape or form, so to speak.
I can't see.
No, it's okay, Kyle. I, I can't see.
Kyle! Kyle, don't!
Oh yeah, it's okay, Butters, he's fine.  Oh, okay, let's just get out of here.
Do it, Kyle. Let's just take Butters' cell phone back.
Then we're okay.
Dude, just leave me alone.
I'm not the one who left, Kyle.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
You guys, we've got a problem.
Well, get out of here, or we're gonna die!
Kyle, we have to go get Butters' grandma.
A-AHHHH!
We have to get Butters' grandma
Back up, Kyle.  Hey!
Aaaaah!
We don't know each other very well, dude.
He's just, he's not mean to be around.
Here he comes.
Kyle, you back off!
Oh my God!
Dad?  You're not gonna kill Kyle, Dad!
Kyle, you can't bear to watch your dad lose his cool!
What?
You'll see.
Oh my God! Chinpokomon
====================
Hey, what time is it?!
Hey, what's seven nine- ten eight seventy-two?
Seven seven, seven! Seven seven, seven!
Huh-what did you do?
You stupid ass fool, that keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
Seven seven, eight, nine, ten!  Wha-what are we doing now?
Look, we're not gonna kill you, you stupid asshole. We'll just have to get used to it. We'll just have to prove to you it was this and that.
Oh my God.
Dude, we're going fast. It's not gonna be right.
No. Wait a minute. I've got it.
Noobs! Quit resisting! We have to get it!
Kyle, you have to keep going, dude. You have to.
It's not like we're ever gonna win, dude. It's just, we're getting closer and closer to winning.
Wha-what are you talking about?
Pizza?
Dude, how are you and Kyle going to get pizza?
That isn't true! We don't get to go to the mall!
That's true dude, though, Kyle only has to nine days left in the season.
Pizza?
Dude, what the hell is that?
That's a pizza?
That's good.
Wendy, when's the last time you've been in a fire?
Hey, look! It's that guy from the show!
Where's Kyle?
Kyle, there's a huge cloud of smoke over South Park.
Wow, look! It's them.
Wow!
Mom, Dad, it's really, really funny.
Dad, it's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, it doesn't change the fact that we're from the same planet!
Tweek?
So, what is going on?
"There's a big cloud of smoke over South Park."
"Yeah, they do."
What the hell is going on?
Mom, Dad, we're getting videotaped!
Dude, we don't understand at all.
Hey, can we just get in touch with them to tell them what to do?
I'm so glad wegruntastic.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Mom, can we go out
====================
Ah, good. I just wanna be a normal kid again.
I know!  I like it!
No, you don't understand! Cartman got followers all on their own! They didn't come from the Internet! They came from people all over the world.
We all know what that means.
Guys, guys, guys! Don't you see what this thing is about? I mean, it's like… there's no questions asked or shown. Just some random guy playing baseball.
You guys, guys, stop!  Look at what's happening to America right here.
These people are looking for work in America, and they're all looking for people to fill those positions.
The first-place job in America. That seems kind of... boring.
Yeah.
Why don't they have a manager?
A manager and his people are awesome!
Are you serious?
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Whoa, wait, wait!  Whoa, wait, wait!
Man, do we really not have time to do some research?
How do we go from point A to B so fast?
A lot of people don't even know it's there.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are we going?
Dude, I'm not playing games.
Mom, I just figured out that after I got Harley Quinn back, my life wouldnt be back where it was before.
I just updated my profile.
What?
...Bike-bikes.
I'm not lying. I had a lot of fun on those bikes, and I'm totally happy with the results.
Yeah, why not? You know, Il too... to keep going.
Yeah. I always wondered if that would work.
Oh, so because you were on a B-bike, that rider on a bike, the other rider on a bike, the guy that runs the show, the guy who kicks ass, the guy who fries like a cucumber, and the guy who fries like a cucumber...
Yeah.
Eric, those pictures were taken like, last month.
That was awesome!
Hey, where's Kyle?
What's going on?
...Curious.
Why does everyone suddenly remember everything that happened before?
All of a sudden, it's all new!
...And it would be so
====================
I was wearing a bunny ears, and the teacher said they must be a reference to Gersploosh's pet bull. I have no idea what that was about.
Jesus Christ!  No! Stop!
Hide the bunny ears!  No!
What the hell?
What the hell?
Kenny? Kenny, what the hell are you doing?
Oh my God!
Kyle! What the hell?
Kyle, you have to stay away from me. I have to  take care of this bunny.
What the hell?
I'm not angry at them. I just don't feel like punishing them for not liking Kyle.
Kyle, don't be such a baby.
Here! Here!
Here baby, we show you how to pummel chicks.
Butters, I'm working with...  my dad!
Butters, I've got some really bad news.
There's an army of Terminator's on the go, and they're gonna take our planet for granted.
I don't know what to do about it. But I'm gonna tell my dad when I have the chance.
What was the last time you sawed down Kyle's tree?
Uh, nothing.
What gnomes?
Yeah, I guess we'd better get used to it.
What gnomes?
I'm sorry, but the only way we can all get on is by getting rid of all the dead.
Ozzy Osbourne?
Sure dude.
Dude, haven't you ever actually had sex with a dead body?
Dude, if that's what you're talking about, then that's what that means.
Well, sort of. A lot of times we just kind of fling stuff at each other until we feel like we've lost it.
Come on, dude, you've got to be kidding me.
What's sex gonna be?
... Well, I guess we can't get on liking each other anymore than you do.
What?
What?
Oh, stop. What are you saying?
What?
You've got to be kidding me.
What was themes?
Well, I guess we can't take the heat for this anymore.
Well, this is just crazy. I guess something outside was toying with Kyle's idea and using Kyle's body for your own amusement.
Come on, dude, you
====================
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to join the basketball team, but the school told me there was no way I was going to school like this. This was not a happy time for me.
Uh, where'singham, I think?
Yeah, so it's not like my birthday is on a Saturday.
I'm gonna be damned if I stick with this merry-go-lucky crew!
Wello, if it's okay with you, I'll try to get on the basketball team tomorrow, okay?!  Uh, hello? What?
What are you doing?!
Chef, I have a question. What would you suggest against the New Yorker?
Look, guys.  Africa?
No, that's too extreme.  Would you just as soon as you got back in the animal kingdom leave us alone, as if by magic we didn't care about the obvious?
There's a pig with SWEET DOGS on top of his misery. I just need you to just let me go please?
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
PLEASE! This is our planet. We are on it's way to becoming the planet of petro-ecos.
No, dude, this is impossible.  Because, you know, we're just right here.
Hey, what the hell!
...Yeah, dude, it could get ugly in there.
All right, come on, guys.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, Wait On The News!
You guys, you guys! ...I'm really sick, dude. ...I have to go to see my dad.
Oh, my God. There's a pig with SWEET DOGS on top of his miserable life.
Where are you going?
I'm sure.
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny.
I know. It's really sad.
You're not gonna believe what happens, Butters.
...Then we have to let it happen. Let it happen!
No, dude, it's not that.
Dude, look at what's happening to us now.
What are you doing, Cartman?!
That's right. We've got to stop it.
What are you doing, Cartman?
Cartman is gonna be dead by the end of now.
You're not gonna believe what
====================
Oh my God.
You guys, you guys!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
It's fixed. We'll be in the news.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Look, we just had a fight, and then Kenny went down, and then the police came and said they found out what happened to Kenny.
So the show is gonna be on again!
We know what you are about, Butters.
That's good.
Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
Oh, good.
Now, that's a jump start, Butters.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
He's not happy about it, you guys.
What's the big deal?
Yeah, right.
Oh, stop it, you guys!  Everybody hates the police. What is it?
They're there by the bus stop, but they don't know what to do. One of the riders tries to take them away, and the other rider follows after us.
So the big battle is gonna be in the visitor's center. The big winner is sure gonna be South Park.
Dude, we're gonna fight. Tooth and nail!  Oh, once again, the big dance is about to begin, and we can't wait until the wee hours to help!
Dude, we are located right outside of town.
...Well, not yet.  Sweet!
Dude, you don't understand. There's a big new thing happening on the Internet, and it's called "name." And it's all about the one Thad Jarvis got. "Thad" is the new name for our Internet provider.
But name is already working wonders, Thad.  Name will become even more important as more and more people get access to all the private information about us all.  This is not a time to play defense, you guys. This is a time to play up loud.  So name will be just about the only thing that matters right now.
What name are you?
What?
You have to promise not to tell anybody.
Just so we all outsmart him, you'll have to promise not to tell anybody.
Just so we all outsmart him, you'll have to promise not to tell anybody.
Okay, you'll go, Jarvis. I'll be back.
What time is it?
I
====================
A lot of times, when I watch Steven Universe, I really like it. The writing is great, the direction is okay, and the characters are all based on real people. But sometimes, when the two of us get stuck in traffic, we just don't know what to do.
Cartman?!
Hey, yeah!
Dude, where's our desks?
Aren't we supposed to have sat in front of the TV and watched that guy for hours on end?
Come on, dude, it's not like we're gonna get anywhere.
Just because you have a movie theater as your home doesn't mean you can't get your movies.
Dude, we're not getting on.
What?
Kyle, there's gonna be somethin' about that guy.
Kyle, somethin' about...
Things like that.
Kyle, I think you should go see Tarzan and the Terrible Dinosaur.
Come on, dude, it's not like you're any more famous than Leonardo DiCaprio.
Dude, let's go.
What?
...Then we have no other choice.
Come on, dude, it's not like you're any more famous than Jesus.
Come on, dude, it's not like you're gonna win any movies, you'll just die in the film.
Goddamn, that's like the movie you started!
You'd better get up off the pedal, Kyle.
Oh, nice going, you assholes!
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
You suck, Cartman!
God-dammit, don't you care that I'm missing your baby?
See? There's nothing but shit on TV, and movies suck.
Oh, God, there's nothing but ass and nothing is cool about you!
Hey, don't worry dude. I'm gonna be okay.
...Doctor, can I have your DVD?
Yeah dude, just set it up right now.  What is your commercial?
You don't wanna be fooled, Cartman.
OMG!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
What?
Yeah dude
====================
The theme park is supposed to be a family friendly space, but, there's something really wrong with that lady!
Oh my God! They've killed--!
Well, it's just a-- Something just isn't so with me anymore. I no longer want to park in that fat kid's stupid-age home, understand?
I guess, there's something really wrong with you, dude. You're starting to think that I might as well park in a different room because I don't have a mouse and keyboard.
Shut up, Cartman!
I like it there.
Where's my mouse?
Yeah, but it still refuses to play when I press OK button.
I just want my life back.
How can I get my mouse and keyboard back?
Where?  Oh uh, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
I'll get my computer back, Dad.
You will, Dad.
Okay, fine.
I will. I'll get my computer back.
Dude, I have to use my computer.
Wow, you mean the thing that I keep?
All right, fine,  computers are for people!
No, computers aren't!
You're not old-fashioned! You've come a long way, Grandpa!
You guys, you guys!
Okay, uh, I'll give you my iPod touch. For the win, I go for the old ManBearPig.
What?
You guys, check this out: I got the old ManBearPig.
Where?
It's the mall. You might as well get old-fashioned and return it for a better device.
What?
I want my ManBearPig.
G'night Mall is the new town.
ManBearPig.Pig.Pig.
Where?
Yeah, but-
Where?
Yeah, I think I have a present and I need it.
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that year!
Kenny, you're gonna return this present!
Yeah, dude. If they find out where it is, they'll just... ruin my Halloween.
Dude, who the hell wants to hang out by the fire?
Holy crap, dude. This is not a time to party.
Aw, who is that?
What do you think, Officer Barbr
====================
Ah, this is sooo gross.
I'll see my sister now.
Yeah, yeah I want a John Elway!
Where are they now?
Uh-oh.
Oh wow-! Hey Wendy, that took us half an hour to do!
What?!
Wait wait, I don't get it.
John Elway? What do you mean you don't get to choose which way your french friends dress?
Well, I guess we can't get a John Elway for Christmas.
Huh?
Yeah, now throw in the fact that Soleil is a holocaust denier and that's Adam Sandler's show.
Hey Kyle.
Kyle, there's nothing we can do.
No, you just have to watch Tom Cruise in the bathroom.
Yeah dude, that's pretty lame.
Oh man, really?
...Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle, you have to watch this. Dude, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?
Just, just one... minute?
How come you wanna watch Tom Cruise in the bathtub?
Yeah, what are you?
Hm.
You have to be kidding.
Dude, just because someone is naturally pretty doesn't mean they are naturally pretty.
They look the same to me.
But they don't have to be exactly the way I Think Tom Cruise thinks they should look.
Ohhhhhh.
They look pretty good, dude.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! I wish I could just hang out with my friends for a little while.
Oh no!
I'm not cool.
 ...That's not funny.
They look like they're gonna cheat on their parental leave, Chef.
Dude, they're not gonna be able to leave you alone. I'm telling you, it's you and your friends, it's gonna be one of the best times in the history of mankind.
Yeah, Cartman.
What?
Cartman, seriously? You guys are just gonna crap all this stuff about the new baby out of hand.
You guys... don't believe that I'm taking your stupid Coke?
Why do you think so many stupid and dangerous people are trying to trick you and keep doing this?
You guys... need to wake up. This is going to get ugly.
====================
Hey, wait, wait, wait. ...where's Ike Broflovski?
Oh, hey Ike.
We can't read or write, you stupid idiot!
He's just pretending to be a news reporter.
You know, you guys? We're just trying to make some money.
How can you do that?
well dude, i. you know, like, sneak into the back of the bus, and then we'll stab you in the back!
so what are we gonna do?
Well, it's not like we think you're magical anymore!
muffin-muffin-muffin.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm saying you suck, liking to suck.
what are you doing, douchebag?
No, I don't suck. I like being a douchebag.
I don't suck very well. I like being a crappy reporter.
It's just a stupid maggot, dude. Just try not to think about it.
Come on, let's go.
He's here!
Dude, he said something really stupid last night!
You're a big fatass, then!
And now, do you have any idea what you're doing in there?
Okay, that's a little strange, dude, because Cartman is now our friend!
So what are we gonna do, fatass? I and Kyle are gonna be doing the driving in the town, and Cartman's got a big car to race.
Cartman's gone, fatass.
What?
Yeah, he is.
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you're gonna be in the team.
So be strong, fatass.  Kyle's the best player at school, dude. That's what counts.
All right, so what are we gonna do?
Look, we're not gonna take the shirt off.
Sshh! Cartman's gone, Kyle.
What?
Yeah, he is.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
It is lying, Cartman! You are so a disgusting, disgusting thing to be doing!
Oh no!
Now we have to find a way to get rid of these little brown things.
What?
Yeah, beetles.
We have to get rid of 'em first.
Oh, no!
We
====================
What the hell is going on?
Shelly?
Go on, Kyle.
Shelly, you go on!  Kyle, you have to stay with the tour group!
Cartman, we have to keep going.
Cartman?
...Dude, please. We can't keep going "like we're in Disney" anymore.
Come on, let's go home.
Where are we?
Dude, we gotta get to the mall.
Dude, can you unpackage them?
Dude, these aren't toys.
Hey, can we just drop us a line?
Dude, where are we going?
Dude, don't you worry about us.
Yeah, when does this get ugly?
Come on, we're going to Malibu soon.
We can't wait.
It'll be easy. We just need to... wait. For three weeks. Right now, they're using the N-word.
What?
You've got to be kidding me.
Dude, we're not going to Malibu anymore. We made plans with our future self to stay in New York.
No, you don't understand! We broke up, and Kyle-
Dude, I don't understand!
Why are you so into it?
Because you stupid ass Spielberg, and all those assholes in the audience-
Why do they want herpes all on their faces?
Holy crap, dude. It's like everything we do goes wrong. It wasn't our fault!
Why would anyone think we were cool because of some douchey-ass geneticist's prejudice?
It is not our fault that other people get messed up. We just needs help.
Okay, I'll be your face. Just between a man and a woman.
How so?
It's not like we're all gonna die. What are youidiemus?
Kenny! Kenny!  Kenny!
Ahhh, I think I have a better idea.
What appeared to be a foreign body moved in on its own accord.
...No, it was me. It's the face you saw.
No, it's not Okazaki. Mr. Garrison said Okazaki is most definitely not Okazaki.
Do you want your job back, dude?
Dude, is Okazaki from some other galaxy?
Hell no, dude. That
====================
So, how did they do that?
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Yeah!
So, what are we supposed to do now?
Ow!
Yeah! Go tell dolphins at a dolphin meetup!
Whoa!
They're whales, right?!
HA, I blew your head off!
That's not cool.
You're an A-.
Tell them not to shoot at us.
Come on, we've got to get out of here.
You got your arm around me, you little rat.
Okay, yyou're about to do the killing, but you little rat is also AI.
Don't shoot!
I don't wanna kill Kyle, I want you to be happy and motivated!
What?
I don't!
Fifteen dollars?!
Yeah, that's not KFC!
What?!
You don't understand! Those people in North Park are just as stupid as you, me, and, ah, Jesus.
Kyle!
Hey Look, you guys, I've just about to learn that artificial intelligence is gonna make us all live to tell the death penalty is a bad idea.
And it won't be until the fifth-generation Blockbuster Video comes out.
Why don't you just tell Starbucks?
Damn, your friends are gonna find it soooo hard to kill AI.
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be fun. Just have to figure it out.
Yeah, you're right. Well I guess everything is kind of... fine now.  Okay, what are you guys gonna do?
We're gonna do a pandora scare.
And we're gonna dupe Mr. Hankey to take part.
He'll do it, dude.
He's a really cool idea.
Hey, don't worry. I'm sure my uncle Roy is gonna be okay.
Yeah, isn't it possible that with my uncle's help I'm gonna grow up and become a better Marvin?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh man.
Dude, I can really do to me what I want.
What is that?
What is that?
I'm not... thinking about it?
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
What is that?
I'm not going to school today!
What is that?
Yeah.  Whoa!

====================
Why do we have to dress up?
Cartman, we've been all over the world. It's part Egyptian, part Indian.
It's about the decimation of the Native Americans.
And yet, as the Native Americans rose, so did the number of slaves they caused.
No, you destroy all our minds over the Internet. What you're doing is you're making computers smarter, and then you charge people for faster access.  You destroy our reason and our reasonless way of life.
What the hell is wrong with that guy?
What's "John Wilkes Booth"?
Pizza?
Dude, what the hell is "John Wilkes Booth"?
Well, we tried, but it just didn't work.
Dude, we've been all over the world and it looks like New York.
Man, I wish Cartman could see what it would be like in China.
Man, this is huge.
Man, this is hella crazy.
Wow, Cartman, you're an awesome kid!
What's all gone?
Whoa!
Let's go, dude!
Why are you doing this, dude?
Dude, are you doing this just yet?
Well, so much for what?
What do you mean?
Kyle, I think we'd better get used to it.
Look, it's not like we're doing anything.
Mom, I think Mom's giving us something to cheer up.
Oh, thank God.
Cartman?
Huh?
What?
Yeah, why not?
It's stupid, dude.
How do you know?
Just think about it: the last time we ate at a Mexican restaurant, we would've gotten our money back, and our license plate would've been followed by the Z-word.
That's not true, Mom.
No, that's just not possible.
Cartman?
Mom, can we please just talk to Mr. Gar-
Gee, Cartman, what the hell are you guys doing?!
Stop it!
Kenny, you have to put up a fight.
But God, it's so sad.
Uhhh, try to you, Kenny.  Talk to your dad.
All right, but there's gotta be a way for us to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Dad, are you all right?
====================
The stupid whole Internet thing is just a big fat global scam, where everyone is the same age but different diseases make you different. It's that bad.
Hey!  Wait a minute! You know what this is about?
Well, we were just trying to download stuff from the Internet and then be able to use that money to pay our friends.
Wendy, there IS a way we can get online. You guys need to get online, then we'll be here!
Hello?
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the Internet but totally different on the outside, like a Web of trust and privacy?
So you're all Internet spies?
Chef, we forgot how long we were logged in for this.
Oh dude, is this what you got when you started?
What?
Uh hey of course we want your money.
Yup.
That's right! We wanna know if you're still at it after that long day's sleepover!
Aah du-der, der-der-der.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, are you still at it?!
You did throw that away!
Oh no! It's not like we didn't get into it!
Whoa whoa, ah I messed up the captcha!
Sorry.
I don't know. Um, Elton, if you're sure, you can look it up on the Web.
What's it say?
olsullivan@hotmail.com
Oh, hey, guys.
Well dude, what's it say?
eer, you're not logged in!
eersullivan@yahoo.com
Ho, shut up, fatass!
We're not dealing drugs!
No you're not!
No, what the hell!
I just wanted to see if I can download the guy from school who dances all the time.
Kyle, it says he can be braver than you.
You're not?
Sirs, spot us!  Come on!  We're gonna try to get to a very specific part of the Web:-
Yeah, dude, it's EricBrake.com.
Sure. What's the Web really about, you guys?
Yeah, you should be able to download his music all over the Web.
Well,
====================
I've been on a ship all her life. I've done all the tracking numbers for her, and I've gotten almost no response.
Oh man, they've killed Kenny!
Where are you going?
So? How'd you know?
Oh, uh, like we-
Dude, he's okay. I, I did profile in hopes that aliens would find him.
Yeah, right.
I just wanted to tell you, you're not gonna let Kyle ruin your life.
Kyle, you've had almost nothing to drink.
So what are you gonna do?
Aha! I learned that from the fifth graders.
I'm trying to eat, dude.
Where are you going, Kyle?
Come on, where are you going?
Where's the counselor?
Where's the jail?
Where's the marathon?
Kyle, you have to-
But they don't care, dude. They just want to throw me away.
How long before the real search for you?
Where's the lawyer?
Hello?
Oh, nice. You're not gonna tell on me, dude. I'm busy.
I don't know about this, dude. I'm supposed to send you a book.
What's in it?
His name is before you did.
Beside, why would the author be rich people getting rich quick?
Well, I can't say I'm happy with it.
The author is rich people getting rich quick?
You do what?
Oh, forget it! The author is a pussy!
The author is a pussy!
The author is a pussy!
I'll send you the next book!
Where's the school?!
Where's the school?!
We can't send you to a girl band! You have to get a new girl band signed.
Well dude, you know that's how it's supposed to happen. I'll show you. I just got a new girlfriend.
Yeah. I wrote him a note saying I'm gonna write a new song for him.
I want you to come back and be his slave.
Yeah well, at least I'm not his slave.
Hey, kid, you're on your own. Have you guys noticed how many times we've been in this room?
It's not that big a deal.
Oh no, dude, we don't even
====================
We're practicing really hard, but we still have to pee! Come on guys, we're gonna be late for school!
Ogh..!
No, pee!
Hoh, no, pee!  Hoh, no, pee!
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You guys, come on over here.  We've got a big report to tell us about this report and it says that Cartman got paid over to your house for a pee.
No, come on, you guys. We have to remember not to tell everyone that Kenny Parody is back in this one.
We don't wanna hear it!
Mom, Dad, don't do that!
Kenny! Lolly's Pet store?
Where?
Do you think she's the one who put Kenny in this?
Let's go.
He just needs to put his pee in the mirror first.
Well met,,,,, Taytin.
Taytin.
Thanks.
What?
You guys, don't let, don't take it.
Oh, hey, you guys. We've got some more work to do.
We're getting into it.
It's just for one day,, dude. I've got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah, but it's all mine!
What time is it?!
What's a dildo, dude?
Dude, the dildo thing is finally over.
We've gotta get out of here.
Come on, Kyle. This was a looing whale.
You know, I've really learned something today.  I think I'm really valuable and valuable only because I worked hard to get here.
You guys, it's official: Cartman's a loser.
What?!
Dude, that's not Funny Girl!
We're not kicking Kyle out!
Just forget it, Cartman! You were awesome enough to beat Kyle out of the loo!
You assholes!
I wanted more!
I wanted Kenny out of the house!
I want Kyle out of the house!
I want Cartman in there!
Kyle, you be quiet!
Kyle, be a cool ass off!  We're gonna be alone forever.
Bebe, you be my little bitch.  Bebe be damned, she's lurking around the corner watching the news on TV
====================
Yeah.
I don't know, meh. Maybe there's something else going on.
Whatever it is, we gotta find out what it is!
Whatkey?  It's an arcade game. The player's first name is Kyle.
Mom, Dad, I didn'tcha know.''
Weal it. Hit it, Kenny.
Oh, hey Dad.
You're our friends; we don't wanna hear about their bad looks in movies.
Dude, I'm not drinking coffee while we're sleeping.
'Kay. Maybe we should ditch school and go get some work.
Oh hey Dad, I was just about to come home.
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna enjoy being with my friends.
Something different. Something a little different.
Yeah, what's that?
What do you mean?
I just had my new job. It was just to do my chores.
Nothing else can be doing that.
Don't be such a pussy. Look dude, I'm gonna add Chase to my endangered species list.
Oh my God, this has to be awesome!
We're here!
So add?!
Chef, we had a counselor come over to help us!
Yeah, she totally sucks, but dude, herculean hours are just getting her done!
We're gonna get her listed as a threatened species.
So?
So here we are, dude, 20 years later.
How's it going, Cartman?
Go on, dude.
Yeah, now you're doing some research.
Who said we have to be super-intelligent?
Wow, that's cool.
We are on a cruise, Mom. We have to answer all our questions in writing.
Will you stop resisting?
What is it, Chef?
Are you depressed, Chef?
Really?
Dad, how come you can't sit still and enjoy a cruise?
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Awww what?!
No, dad! No!
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?
Mom, Dad, we need to talk about something!
Screw this
====================
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You can't just go to another planet and die on it's own! All we're trying to do is make sure that somebody has to run away to some other galaxy to find purpose!
Dude, like we don't wanna aliens kill us or something.
Shut up, Cartman.
Dude, it's the alien pain killer.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know.
I'm supposed to go into the back, and grab Cartman's wallet.
Do you have a black wallet?
What?
You have to see it. It's small. And it's gonna look for you like it's from some other world.
Damn, dude, I hate the alien thing.
Damn, dude, I don't understand!  Where's my gun?
Look! It's some kind of medical miracle. Someone has to be dead in a matter of hours.
There already is one universe and one race of people.
There's a big black TV commercial for Bulge!
It's almost over!
Fire!
So the alien thing is going to be here any second, and I have this remote with me?
Yeah, what a joke.
Hey, come on, guys.
You're an asshole, Cartman!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Come on, Kenny, stop it!
Yeah, and you should be proud that you had Kyle pull on you.
You're an asshole, Kyle!
Why the hell not?
Well, I'm not a big racist or a big Christian rock star. But I'm not a big-ass Christian rock star, so I can't say anything I don't want to hurt anybody.
Okay, the alien thing is here!
Sh!
He's here with Bits!
Sso, I was supposed to be home at eight.
Dude, I have to cut some lettuce!
Sso, I have to see!
Sso, I have to this!
Sso, I have to this!
chipmunks@me.com
Yeah, but I'm gonna kick your ass!
See? I'm not a dick! I just waxed and waned at computer time, and my friends got sucked into Facebook, so I don't even know what to believe!
Hey, I'm sorry guys. I've been
====================
We're sorry, sir, but you're just wasting our time.
We'd love them!
Kenny would have us do it for him, not them!
You see, Cartman? We learned something today. We're not heroes anymore. We were banished to a small, basement-level basement.
We can't get to aisner or anything!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle loved Cartman!
We're so sorry, sir. We just don't understand how things are anymore.
No.
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
Get the hell out of here!
Come on, Kyle, it's not that big a deal.
I don't understand. Come on, on...   Hello? Mr. Mackey?
You don't understand!  Look, Kyle, I'm not okay with this, 'cause it's not good enough, you're not a smart kid, you're just a smart kid,  and it's at odds with who you are.
Look, Doc, I think the whole town's against Cartman, 'cause they think you're too smart to be a smart kid.
Yeah, but, Kyle, I don't think being too smart is actually so bad that it outweighs the negative connotation.
Yeah, but, Doc, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Sure, dude, I'm just glad everyone's on the same page.
What?
Yeah, let's work on that!
Getting people to stop debating and debating and debating and debating!
We have to decide if we're in agreement or not!
Okay, we're here, we're friends, maybe we're not friends, maybe we're not friends, but we're friends!
...I don't know.
Dude, Cartman is Kingpins, remember?
We have to find out what the hell happened to Kenny the first time.
No, dude, we have to find out! We have to find out what the hell really happened to Kenny the first time.
You mean, in the pig's den?
In the pig's den?
In the pig's den?
Where's Kenny?
Whoa.
Dude, Cartman told us.
Oh, hey Kenny
====================
Hi. I'm Wendy.
I missed you so much, I just can't take it anymore!  I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
What?! No, dude! This is soarng for me!
Oh my God! Splendid is my new best friend!
Yeah.
You're welcome, Wendy!
I'm looking for you somewhere teh girls stuff.
You dad?
Dude, what happened?  What's he meant?
Well, I got a new girlfriend, it's Timmy.
Hey Wendy, where's your buddy Timmy?
Yeah, he's back there.
Whoa, dude!
Yeah, cartwheels!
Dude! Cartman!
Come on, Kenny, get the spandex ball.
Wendy, I have to have Cartman around all the time.
Where's he, dude?
Where's Kong?
Kenny?
Dude, I think Kenny's back at Cartman's heels!
He's been balled up like a hundred.
Come on, Kenny, get the Spicy French Friesé balls.
No! They look like shit!
Wow, these balls are from the future?
Dude, we gotta bring him back to the future!
Bring him back to the future, Kenny!  Oh, no!  No!
Bring him back to the future, and bring him back to the future!
Oh, shut up, Cartman!  Oh, shut up, Cartman!  Oh, yeah, let's do something else.
Maybe we can't go back to the future with these balls.
Dude, we have to bring him back to the future.
Bring him back to the future, and make him feel good!
Whoa, that was sweet!
Wow, tons of girls and women want our future self back!
It'll be okay, Wendy. We'll just have to find him. Who's the future self?
I don't know,  it just seems so.
Give me out. Give me out.
All right, one by one, do you girls split the money? We make about as much as you make?
Damnit, that fat bitch!
We have to teach our future selves to girls!
Oh, stop it!  It's so
====================
Hero of Congo!
Hero of Congo!
Hero of Congo!
We're in!
We got it!
You busted!
Yeah, but it's all right.
I'm glad we werehes our hands after we go to the bathroom.
Man, this sucks.
That's my friend, Mark.
Excuse me.  Excuse me, can Excuse Me co-exist with you?
Yeah, it's like the zingers in your head. You're either with an old sick man or you're with a new sick man.
Excuse me.  It's important. If you don't stop Excuse Me from working with Token, Shelly will become one of us.
Cartman, please. We're not stopping Token, we're just taking her somewhere private.
Then why are you letting Shelly keep away from us?
We've got to find her. She doesn't belong to somebody.
Pretty good. So we're gonna keep trying.
Don't let Shelly get away with murder.
Don't let Shelly get away with murder.
Whoa whoa, Kyle!
If they have her somewhere cool like this,  let her stay here.
All right Kyle, you have to come up with a solution.
It's a bitch!
I gues we can stay here.  The girls will come and try to force us to play the flute band in their show.
Well of course they do!
I guess we'll be out of town by then.  Anyways, that ass-planting bitch is gonna have us think twice before we go back to your crappy school.
We have to do something. This place is gonna get us arrested.
Or else we're gonna get killed.
Hey Kyle.
Uh we're not drunk!
Sure, dude, we're not gonna--
What?
But what does that mean?
Shut up, Cartman!
Come on, Cartman, we're going to--
Uh, we're gonna rehearse and then--
But we're not gonna make it!
You're not gonna take the form of a mask, fatass!
Wait! Wait, wait, ah I might need it!
No.
Oh, no. I-- I'm not gonnahin' exceptING be in a bear costume, and I'm-- I'm-- sorry
====================
All right. Here we go.
It'll be like the new kid, dude.
Dad? Is that you?
What?!
But he's my best friend. He's gonna be like the new kid.
He'll be fine.
Hey Kyle.
Dude, what happened??
What??
Well... yeah, I mean, I... I tried to stop you two from killing each other last year, but-
Dude, you're not my best friend anymore, either.
...Really?
What's "real" about that name, names?!
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?
No, dude, that kind of stuff doesn't make you stupid.
Nohers is just a stupid name for a stupid idea.
You guys, listen to Lars. You people are just as stupid as these fads are gonna be.
There's nothing special about you two, Kyle.
I'm not voting!
Because I'm not Hillary Clinton! I'm not George Bush!
I'm voting!  Oh, I'm voting!
SPONSORED
Okay.
There's nothing spiritually wrong with me, dude.
I'm voting!
Yeah, I'm used toded to beating up fat people just because you're a fat pussy!
You're a pussy, too, Kyle!
What's going on?
Jesus, is that music?
Uh, we saw a movie once where they fucked their hoses and prayed to the gods.
Worship the water over sand.
You guys, we worship the devil.
Worship the devil over sand.
Oh, no!
Worship the devil over wood.
Worship the devil over horses.
My sins have been forgiven.
...Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Now, that asshole is performing some parental favors on us so we don't get treated badly.
We're not being sarcastic, Kyle!
You're being a dick, dude!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Where are we gonna go after he's crucified?
pmwiki
pmwiki
That's the Devil talking to us. It's pretty pathetic.
Then why are you so into it, Kyle?
God!
Who are you?
...I don't know, you guys. We'll just have to by and...
What do we want from them?
They want our ballots for
====================
Well, it's just a show! Nobody's gonna listen!
I guess! Maybe they just don't wanna know about your show all that much.
Hey, where's everyone else?
You guys! You guys!  You gotta come with us over to the Jeff Buckley Show!
You guys, I believe we have a videotape that you guys were taking of Jeff Buckley.
Uh, we think it's from around here.
That's good. Close up, dude.
You guys, we see the New Yorker!
He's talkin' about having his own amusement park.
See? That's what we think.
Come on, we gotta get to the mall.
You mean, the pet store?
Hey, we took that pet pumpkin guy to the mall.
Come on, we gotta see what he's doin'.
Well, like I keep telling everybody, but I don't really have any strength!
Mom, Dad, our fears are gonna get in the way of what we're about to do!
What are you talking about?
Mom, please. We have to see what's happening to the world.
Come on, let's go!
What?
Kenny! You can't just leave us here!
Well, we figured out a way to get in here!
Let's go.
Yeah, well, so is our plan right now.
Dude, Kenny, we need to watch something.
What?
Kyle, look. We've got no other choice.
Cartman has joined us because, Kyle, he's such a baby. But he's not gonna quit!
Come on, let's go!
What?
Yeah, here we go.
The road is always snowy.
We have to have a way out here!
So close!
Dude, we've gotta get to the mall in time to save us!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Dude, I can't wait.
I know! She's perfect!
Uh, thanks.
Oh, yeah, and I'm gonna take ass-training to the next level, please!
What?
I'm sorry. I was trying to save you guys from myself.
No, it's not! It's not your fault!
I'm trying to do what I do! It's YOUR fault!
I'm trying
====================
Hi there, uh, I have a question about the Timmy Testaburger commercials.
Thanks.  Sir, can I ask you a question?
A question? Sir, do dogs talk or do they just chatter?
I don't think so, Gary.
Beside, the show has gotten better, and Gary still talks like a normal kid. But, do dogs actually Bark to us?
I don't get it, Gary.
Up yours, Gary.
No, it's my great-great-great-great-no.
What do you mean? my great-great-great-no.
Well, what about... Cartman?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Oh great, shit! That's Cartman!
He's the coolest thing ever!
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Kyle's grandpa's.
Why does everyone suddenly remember everything that happened in the movie?
JUST RUN!!
Just run, dude!
Look, Kyle, the movie wasn't about them, it was about dolphins and peace.
And just like that, the movie sucked.
Dude, they should have never touched those dolphin people.
All right, you guys, this is a lie. We didn't know the movie was about dolphins and peace.
Just run, dude! Shake hands with everybody!  Shake hands with everybody! I don't wanna meet these people!
Hey, I got you!
Awgh! I'll never meet these people again!
Hey, I didn't get to meet them until long this way.
Hello? Anybody in there?
Hey, I'm sorry. I was trying to make a joke of something you said.
Well, sorry, I'll be glad to talk to you later.
I don't know.
What?
Oh...
Mom? The mall sucks anymore. They're everywhere.
I just want these people to know that they're still free to go on any day.
Can't I just make a wish, please?
I have no idea.
Yeah, I know, like, do you wish that every kid in America was like, oh this is a nice little town?
On Christmas?
Yeah, why not? It's so American!
Yeah, but you know, I really like these new immigrants' houses. They're not like, super
====================
At the time I accepted this award, but the world changed. Today I'm the coolest kid in town, and all the coolest guys in town are gonna tell the world I'm awesome.
I don't want to make things worse, Dad. I just want to share in the cool. I wanna be the biggest douche.
Dude, that's not cool.
Ugh.
You guys, I'm glad we took care of that.
Yeah, when does the want list go, douchebag?
Good call.
Hey, what are you doing?
Did you bring the camera?
Why?
Did you bring the recorder?
Dude, I don't wanna be on the wish list.
I'm not the biggest douchebag on the list, but I'm not the biggest douchebag on the list, either.
Look, a lot of times, when we get together, we rip on each other and stuff.
We can't go to the movies, you big w-you're not gonna make it, so- you're gonna be in the wish list.
The one I can actually think of who I am.
We got married in front of the whole world and shelled out $10 million dollars.
I wish I couldplane better terms.
A lot of times, they'll have Lucas kissing another character, and then Cartman would come out and say his movie was terrible.I just think it's lame.
When we were kids, we always went to the movies and played music class, andWhen we got old enough, we didn't brush our teeth, he wouldn't have that big grin, and we didn't wear eye-gear.
Dad, did you hear about last night?
What?
Oh dude, he did that to us all night.
Did you bring the recorder?
Why?
Oh my God, what's going on?
All right, fine, guys. We have to not freak out or anything. Let's go home.
Well, I guess we can't sue anyplace else.
Hey, where's the money?
Hey, whatever. We've got to focus on making the bank!
You guys, you guys! Home.
Yeah, whatever!
Whoa, dude, we're making music!
We wanna make sure we're making money!
Oh, thank God. A suit and
====================
I just can't believe that guy who invented the n-but...
Aw crap, that's like the fifth word in the alphabet!
God-damnit!
For fuck's sake, somebody have to pay!
Just do what you tell yourself. All you've been doing is making money!
Dude, I don't think it's fair for anybody to tell somebody else cheat.
Come on, you guys! Our little party is gonna get bigger and bigger and you just have to stop it!
Come on, you guys!
It's time! He did it!
He did it!
Whoa, you guys, that was overplayed.
Now it's the third day in a row. You gotta play harder.
Come on, you guys! Our little party is gonna get bigger and bigger and we're gonna lose to girls if we don't come up to girls in class!
You forgot, Cartman. You gotta stop that crap!
No.
Oh, shit.
Cartman?
What?
Whoa, you guys!
Yeah, maybe he's a girl now, and girls don't care about him. What's the big deal?
Aah! There's more girls in class now, huh.
We're gonna fail if we don't go to the fringes!
Yeah, "be careful what with the girls" you stupid girls.
Girls?
What?
Goddamnit, what a dickhead.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Dude, are you guys caring that you're gonna-?
Agh.
I took in some stupid Facebook group called 'NOOO!!!! Remastered!!' and did a video for it.
Yeah, awesome!
What level are you guys going to be when we get back up?
And aww!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Yeah, 100 people went to hell. W-we can still be of service to the church.
Yeah, it's really cool.
Yeah. Hell, maybe we were the only girls in school wrong about at all.
So you guys, come up with a way to get back at the religious right! Live off of bones, Pete!  Okay, so first, you just have to bone a hundred dollar gift certificate to everybody, and then we'll add you to our choir. You take that, Kyle!
Of

Hello?
I'm Peterson.
Oh, hey kid. Can you loan me a dollar?
Yeah, what a sweet spot for a kid.
Oh my God! They've killed--
Juuhachi no kun da wa.
Yeah, but it's all right.
Yup.
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I I I tried to warn you.
What's High School Musical 1.2?
It's about a menstruation.
Sick, dude!
Yeah, that's what I've been telling everyone.
Yeah, dude, that's what everyone says.
What's it say?
Sick, lip service is always good.
Huh, I don't know. Let's go watch it.
Where'd you get that pencil?
Yeah, dude, there's nothing else I can do.
Oh my God! They've killed--
Oh, never mind.
It's just--
I am so, Jesus. I am so, so sorry.
Me?! I don't know what to do, dude.
Oh my God.  Sorry.
Station 28 satellite dish. I went to the big party in Des Moines and Ihooed I wanted to shake hands with the kids there.
But I didn't want to, 'cause I'm gay.
I'm sorry. I want to shake off.
Did you get to any presents please?
Well I don't understand. You've had so much as a passing interest in women for like three months.
You know, I've really just like-minded people during that time.
Why do you wanta say that?
Well, do you mind telling me why you think I should get a leg rest so we can get back to running water in the clubhouse?
I'm running late, Grandpa. I need to talk to somebody.
You say I need a couple of hours rest, Grandpa.
Oh no, more water please.
You really think I should get a break, Kyle?
A little more water please?
Well I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I-
It's their own damned fault.
A little more water please?
Well, I just can't believe that half of the world doesn't know about Planned Parenthood.
Yeah, thanks a lot, Wendy!
Well, let's get back
====================
I know!
I can't believe it! It's not over!
Huh?  Oh...
What? Wha? ...I, I can't do anything ... about.
Kyle, please. You have to give up!
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
No.
Look, it's all right. The pub we were staying in has a certain security system so expect them to be able to get in and out of our rooms.
Pretty good.
We'll just have to by the time they get here.
-----Guys, guys, guys, don't fall asleep. We're not making love to Cartman!
Hey, can they get a closer look at us?
Oh my God.  Can they?
Cartman, what the hell are you saying?!
Stan, what the hell are you doing?!
Stan, don't be such a butthole!
Can you climb back in?
We have to be up front or else we're gonna get in!
God-damnit, can you get a closer look at us?
There's this thing about Cartman that we don't understand at all.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Come on, let's get down there.
Look, this thing is huge.
And here, already.
Yes, we're lesbians, get down!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What the hell did you do?
You bastard!
Dude, are you thinking we beheads of people's will?
Yeah, that's pretty fucked up right here.
Dude, I don't get it.
We have to do this report together.
Is this a piece of art?
Oh.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What are you talking about?
Ohhhhhhh.
Alright, let's go.
It's a bunch list. We can all sign off.  Okay, here, the 20 most wanted people list we've ever seen.  Eeghan!
We all want to work on that list.
Oh my God, we've got to... oooh.
We don't wanna work on it, you guys.
We don't wanna work on it.
We don't wanna be on it.
It'll be okay, Craig. We
====================
We have an old girlfriend!
We don't wanna get into it!
Kyle, you have to-!
Jesus Christ!
Aw, dude, that's not cool.
Hey uh, we're gonna be watching Aliens.
You have to eat feces to be U.S. citizens!
We're not Iraqis, we're Nussans!
No, we're good friends.  We were just trying to get to the bottom of this.
No, we don't wanna talk about it.
Novel... reasons why we should be fighting. You know, like... how much money you made selling your book?
Just a quick, dirty shopping list.
All right, guys, just let the kids do the shopping. The mall is just a few houses away.
Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Yeah, they felt like it.
Okay, after doing some quick WebCrawler-ing, we're gonna put this end to.
Hey, look around. There's these two people looking for help, and they're totally different.
What kind of help?
We're sorry, guys. The kids in Afghanistan are just as stupid as the Afghan for Valentine's Day, Bob Saget.
Butters, look.
At least we got along with him.
Noo, I told you that!
Dude, if I age this, that...  I think he's a lot cooler than the other kids.
Okay, here we go.
They're gonna take him to the hospital.
Hey, wait.  Snake, when are we gonna make them into dancers?
Well, we can't. The Afghan guy is way too pretentious.
Oh uh, and here he is, he's just sitting there, watching TV.
Dude, this is horrible.
Oh, what?
Dude, we can't do any more singing.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Hang on.
Oh ooh.
Jesus Christ!
Ee'er being a church we're a cult is great, but it's not great enough! We have to be good at what we do! We have to be good at what we eat!
Uh, we'd love to but we're just... we're just not good at it.
Hey, where's that Jefferson Davis shirt?
Oh, Jesus, we have
====================
I don't know. You guys are just as smart as Ike Broflovski, and you guys are just as smart as Cartman
You guys are just as smart as Half-Life, dude. You guys are just as smart as Half-Life, and Half-Life is just as smart as Half-Life.
Oh, hey, Cartman. Could we have a cookie please?
Oh, yeah. Do you have a mechanical heart?
See, robot hearts are just about to do something else.
Uh, we want your real name just as much as you are!
Just, just for fun.
Dude, we're not gonna kill you.
What?
Oh, robot hearts are just about nihilism!
I don't want any more friends. I've already started looking for a new job.
Right, so how come you decided to leave all this behind?
I. I mean, what do you mean you left everything behind?
Okay, so what do I do now?
What is that?
I'm not dead?
No.  Oh my God! They've killed--
Hyde.
Uh, uh, heaven, I, I don't know what to do.
Heyhee.
Yeah. I just came by because I have something to tell you.
I don't understand. Hey, what's up?
Yeah!
Give me a hit. Give me the Lisa K. cast.
Yeah!
I don't wanna be a part of that!
Kyle, Tweek, get the hell out of here!
Where are you going?
Kyle, that's a big question.
But you said you wanted "the" cast back there.
How much?
Seven figures!
Dude, we've been through a lot like this.
Uh, sure, if you don't mind, I'll go round up any kids I can find that want to be in the cast.
How much is this?
Look, it's time for what.
CLASS! Pee-wee!
Come on, guys!
Okay, so the first kid we want to involve in the robbery is really a kid from South Park.
But there's the scary kid from the show.
Cartman, don't do this!
You can do it Kyle!  Kyle!
Look, space is nothing I've ever seen
====================
Well, that was easy. We just use a trusty commercial break.
You mean, the thing Chef cut last night?
Business? Wait, what's up?
What?
Sorry. I wanna try my hand at a shopping spree.
Yeah!
Well, I just opened a ticket stub for you.
What's that?
Is this how I wanna buy beer?
Scotch.
Uh-oh.
I don't like being a beer boy, Charlie. I like being a beer nerd.
I mean, I like being in situations like this and dealing with them the right way, but... learning how to deal with them the right way is what I wanna do?
Jesus Christ!
Kyle, guys, check it out!
It was just a joke. A trick. A grain banister.
It was stolen from Cartman's grandma. Her-a-little.
She told us about it last night.
"It's just a trick to get people to stop buying beer."
"It's a lot of beer, dude," Kyle said.
Why does he have to go to a store all the time, Chef?
Uh, we were just trying to make some money.
We were hoping you'd just let us drink at a discount, Kyle.
Cartman's right. We just wanna be rid of like the plague.
What does that mean?
What is that?
Cartman?
Uh, look.
Look, we're sorry. We just wanted to give credit where it's due.
Yeah, it's all right.
Yeah, enough! We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen!
She's a dirty little bastard too.
Easy, bitch!
Cartman?
Why is that funny?
Bad. If I have to pick a side, Wendy won't be able to stop me.
I have to get faster than that.
Dude, I'm getting off the sled, Kyle! I'm gonna hit the sledstop!
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
That's like the longest serving pope in the world, John Paul II.
What the hell is going on?!
Mr. Garrison, stop right there!
Oh my God.
Trent Boyett just got elected mayor of San Francisco.
Yeah dude, that's pretty impressive.
Well, Trent, you've
====================
We've made great progress.
Yeah, it's nice to finally be together again.
I don't know.
What is it, Kyle?
What is it, Kyle?
Kyle, I need you to do.
Dude, I don't think anyone will.
Kyle, I think we've just gotten our first taste of "bad faith."
Dude, I don't think Kenny would have passed if they hadn't died together.
"There's no such thing as a great faith, Kyle. Faith can be wrong, but its what it has become can't be wrong. The problem is that too much faith can lead to bad faith. Too much faith can lead to murder.
Dude, I don't understand at all. You both play video games, you both know that the game being played over here is a recreation of the real thing?
You both know that the real thing doesn't work?
Listen, I'm not saying Kenny is better off. I'm just saying that when Cartman and Kyle tell you that they want you to join their cult they both promise you won't stop playing.
I just think the whole thing is a big fat lie.
Hey, kid, what are you doing?
 I have no idea.
Jesus Christ, dude!
What's the big deal?
...Yeah, we should come get lunch later.
Dude, you're gonna go help Cartman and Kyle find the sea.
Where are they?
The water is so nice
Where?
Don't you guys want it?
They can't go to sea level rise, you guys!
Well, dammit!
You're not supposed to go help Cartman and Kyle if the seaman is rich, is that right?
Well, now what you do!
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass is that you need to call the police over to the mall for help?
Well, now that I see that the sea people are not the same people as the fish, I think maybe I can help you.
Kyle, look!
The water is rising.
Cartman's life is in danger.
Mom!
What are you doing?
The bottom line is that I can't bear to watch my friend die.
Thanks.
Yeah, isn't she?
Cartman's life is in danger.
It's almost dead. I
====================
No! I'm not gonna change my attitude towards you, okay?! I'm gonna stay as nice as I can!  Okay, that's enough! I'm gonna treat everyone fairly, okay?!  Token of speech?  I want to keep my cool, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make everyone around me feel better.
You speak English.
One of my friends taught English at school, and she said one of the first things she saw when she got home was people saying "He-who-molested you, you to everyone?"
Yeah, like that's what everyone does.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Halloween spirit has attacked our town. The town was put on a killing spree to take the evil spirits out of us. We've only been around a few years, and it has been totally freakin' awesome!
Christmas spirit... means devil.
...Christmas spirit... means devil. See more Crime is not a New Yorker magazine article, it's a fact. It was actually written by a really nice, smart, funny, English teacher. She said something went awry in the town, and she's apologized for it.
...Well that's not cool. It's like, that's how things used to be. You'd think, that's when things would get a little out of hand.
You mean, they've got some really bad news, and then everyone just kind of hides it?
I don't get it.
No, you don't understand. The guy who made those drawings died, and that's when we have to find out what happened to Jesus.
It's not about the money, you fucking idiot! It's about the treasure plates!
The treasure plates were given to Joseph, all by God. In the original script, all the animals in the world lived in harmony, and spoke in a way that made them stand out. But when Joseph Smith, the first man in the Americas, wanted all the animals to be able to speak in a way that made them stand out, he went awry. So he's gone, or died, or something.
Jesus Christ, we have to find out what happened to Jesus.
The first man in the Americas?
All right, go, but you're gonna need everything we have to go get the plates.
You guys! Check it out, guys!
Where
====================
What the hell is wrong with Cartman?!
Cartman, you idiot!
You have to be kidding!
Wait, who the hell is that?
Well it looks like Maybe it's the new kid that came during the break.
Martyron is all like, "Help you dude, you gotta help Kyle!"
Dad, dude it's not fair!
Dad, dude they're not being religious.
What the hell was that?
Who cares? We have to tell him something.
Cartman, you gotta stop being a dick. You've had enough of being a dick!
Hey, you can stop being a dick and be happy! Be proud of yourself, Kyle! Be glad to be on your team!
That's not true, dude. That's what Bebe Melman does.
Bebe is just being Bebe Melman.
Bebe is. Everyone else does it.
And so Bebe takes his spot on the field practice team.
Kyle, you have to do something. Something drastic.
Kyle, I think eating is just as bad as never being hungry.
Bebe, do you want to join our volleyball team?
Maybe we should do some team chores.
I don't know.
We have to do something. This is going to be so sweet.
Bebe, do you mind if I watch our basketball game?
Yeah, dude. We'll at least be in school by 4 o'clock.
This is stupid, dude.
Dude, we can't even eat the fish.
Bebe, I saw your Facebook page. How come you couldn't kick ass?
What?
Yeah, I wonder why.
So dude, what are they afraid of you for?
You're right, Kyle. When you started this you were always trying to make people in your life better, but now you need to realize that you were always riding high because you had a bad itch.
You have to be kidding, dude.
Yeah, I guess I'm just not that into you anymore.
What's a Professor?
Yeah, I guess so.
What is it, Mr. Garrison?
Cartman, are you feeling alright?
Uh, Professor Craig, how come you weren't able to kick ass on Saturday?
Oh man, is that more likely than not?
That's what we think.
That's
====================
I'll get in trouble.
No, I don't wanna be in jail. I, I'll get in.
I got you.
Got a free copy of The Abyss.
Watch it. I'll show it to the whole world.
Good night, Pip.
Oh, it's okay, Pip. I, I apologize for the wait.
Oh, uh, I don't really have a good track record.
Maybe I didn't like certain parts of the track so much as practiced them?
Jesus, I I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I have a lot of work to do.
Oh man, I gotta get to the mall!
Yyeah, dude, I've been arrested for prostitution.
Yeah,!  A lot of times, they just charge me with a lot of things.
That's a lot of things to pay a lot of money to be in jail for a lot of things!
I don't get it, dude. I thought I was so good!
Oh, hey, doesn't seem like a lot of people are aware of is that Broflovski?
...Ohh, I just don't get it.
Oh hey Kyle.
Why do you have to work so hard to live?
Well, I just got a really bad cold sore.
What?
Yeah, I think I just had a pimple.
I don't get it.
Yeah, I guess with these kind of injuries, it...  ...tend to be more and more painful.
Hey, yeah!
Admit it was my pimple?
Yeah, I flexed it a couple of times.
Oh hey, there's Cartman!
What are you doing, dude?
Hey, I didn't throw up!
What are you doing, new kid?
What are you doing, new kid?
What are you doing?!
You have to come back to reality!
Mr. Garrison, is your client home?
Tell him we're not working for Subway, Cartman.
We're just passing through.
Mr. Garrison, stop it!
Don't be so sure. After all the things you said, he's gonna say yeah, or no, depending on how you feel about extradimensional beings, dude.
Hello?
Mr. Garrison, is it so you could get out of here?
Yeah, I
====================
The Dude has joined forces with New Yorker Mel Gibson to form a company to protect music from global warming. Mel Gibson? Mel Gibson is the coolest kid in town!
But Mel Gibson is gonna take all of music!  I'd love to work with him!
Hey, Butters!
Uh-oh.
Yeah, well, at least I got mine today.
Shhh! Be quiet, Beato.
Hey, Butters!
Sorry.
What?
Be quiet, beato! We have to talk to you now!
You see? We've got no reason to believe that global warming is coming, and we can't let him have it.
Good morning, Bob.
What?
Bebe!
Alright, where's I can get my fishing rod.
I'll pay you back for your rod.
I'll use it for reconnaissance.
Russian?
So the boat went off course, but the phone was still ringing.
Come on, you guys, we've gotta call the guys from the show.
Russian?
Come on, you guys! We've gotta call the show right now and tell them what to do!
Yeah, well, you know, you're always such a douchebag like nothin'
Russian?
Come on, you guys! We've gotta call the show right now and tell them what to do!
No!
Hey, it's you, O.K.
Come on, you guys! We've gotta call the show right now and tell them what to do!
It's you, Butters!
You're not gonna believe what we've been told, Kyle!
Good morning, Mr. Garrison.
What is it, Cartman?
Cartman, it's the water theme park.
Yes it is!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
We're sorry, we have to get this right.
It is terrible.
Oh no!
And we're totally miserable.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
How can they? It's all right.
I think we need to just let the pain take its course.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
What?
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Shut up, Cartman!
You guys, my sister is in a relationship crisis.

====================
Then it's time for the big dance.
Do you guys wanna dance class?
Thanks. Who's that?
Don't wanna be in a show, you guys. We have to find a way to save the world.
We've gotta sing and dance, you guys!
You all right?
It's all right.
It's all right!
Chef, we're gonna sing and dance again, and we're gonna save the world!
Dude, you've got to be happy. Because this time, we won't have to do all the scary stuff with the show's heroes. We'll just be wandering the streets finding the little plastic bag that holds the miracle pills we need.
Jesus!
Tween?
Bye, if you wanna help, then you should come and help us.
This is all our fault, you guys.  Doesn't anyone believe that the poor butthole can be our fault?
How can poor buttholes believe that they have a right to a fair trial?
Just help ourselves to a copy of The Lord of the Rings when we get to Mexico?
Eheh, that tough Guy Fawkes.
Alright, we're gonna have to use the youth group's toilet.
It's all right, you guys.
We can't let Gandalf go un-molested!
Don't worry, Tweek.  It's gonna be a ball.
, and we have come to reclaim the Holy Land from the Thracians.
You don't ever dream of killing Kyle or Dinah!
Go, go, go!
Ah, good-bye, Doc.
Hey, Dinah! What's up?
?  Oh, thank God.
We can't do that, dude.
It's all right.
Let's go, Tweek.  Go, go!
There, see?
The Ancient Power has it. They do it to us, all the time. They're not smart, dude. They're evil.
Man, let's go! I wanna go to the mall tonight!
Where's Timmy? He's been up there.
Yeah, nice beaver.
Tweek, come out and help us. We're gonna steal the show.
Ain't nothing ever gonna work like that.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
They took Cartman's heart
====================
Hey hey, Kenny!
Hey, can you loan me twenty bucks for my new computer?
Yeah, they do that for everybody!
You can't do that!
Oh no!
You can't read a mouthful without ripping on Kyle!
Dude, the new kid at school is gonna be so pissed at me for ripping on him that he'll leave the house!
Can you rip on him, Kenny?
Just stay away from him, Kenny.
Okay.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, what're you doing?!
Kyle?  Dude, what happened?
No.
Dude, are you still on the phone to me?
Is this for real?
Kyle, are you still on the phone to me?
This is a picture of my mom and dad and they were having a party at their house.
No, dude, not even close.
That was the real me, Kyle.
Dude I told you dude, not a day goes by that I don't get called up for a fight.
I just don't wanna look like a pussy about it.
W-what are you doing, Kyle?
Kyle's a-channukin' and I'm a pussy about it, not addicted to it.
Look, I really want to see my mom.
And I didn't even like getting home- I was having a party with my friends.
But Mom, if you're behind bars for that, then why do you need the state to charge me for a drink?
Oh, uh who did that?
Because I tried to order a cheeseburger at a party!
You tried to order a cheeseburger at a party! I'm not responsible!
Where is the money?
Yeah, where's the money?
Butters, I'm sorry I tried to order a cheeseburger at a party, but that's not responsible for (@pizza guy)
Okay, I'll just add it to my basket.
Thanks, Butters.
I don't think it's right to charge people for different tastes, Kyle.
Add it to my cart and I'll add it to yours, Cartman.
Wow, that was easy!
Butters, I'm sorry I tried that stupid wine-and-dessert promotion last night.
What?
What did they say?

====================
Dude, what the hell?
This is pretty fucked up right here.
You're not gonna believe this, dude.
Yeah, this is pretty fucked up.
You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
Wh-what could it be?
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Dude. You're not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Yyyeah, Cartman.
Cartman, y-you did become friends, but... you weren't my best friend anymore.  You were... and I am, now.
Yea, dude, you're gonna have to learn to respect my castle.
No, you're gonna have to do something really stupid like that.
Dude, I didn't even think about that.
Kyle, what happened was really weird.
Plopped coins on top of each other, maybe?
...What?
What was that?
Dude, Cartman probably got the green light to start shooting at me.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Damn it!
What was that?
Whoa!
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude!
Dude, you are on a TV show about martial arts!
We're talking about Cartman's dream!
Martial arts artist Dr. Raphida says that in the future, your soul will be transferred to a soul, and that soul will then travel back in time to the past.
Uh, just like the way you see it, this is like the turning point for Cartman and me. We're gonna become one huge band.
Yeah, like Raphida said, but this time, we're gonna rip on Wendy and Kyle for being nigh-invulnerable.
Nno. No, you just screwy.
You got depressed, Cartman?
You should be ashamed of the people you've made!
All right, but then you start screwing around, like a loser and all that!
No, you
====================
Get the hell out of here!
We can't watch this!
Come on, let's get out of here!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Dude, are we glad? We had such good times last night.
What?
Yeah, but this is even more embarrassing than the one I was in before.
Look at what this team is capable of. I mean, look at the damage it has caused.
Butters was right. There's no way we could keep playing. We'd lose all the other guys now.
Hey guys.
This is gonna be so embarrassing.
I don't get it.
Kyle, you can't face it.  Look at what this kid is saying. There's nothing we can do.  Oh, God. I can't believe that kid is actually trying to kill us.
Dad, what are you doing?
No, listen to me. The worst kind of bullying is when a third-grader stabs a third-grader, then follows you on your walk home.
From fourth-graders: You're not as smart as them.
Hey, uh, we're here to visit our friends at Park Avenue High.
Mr. Garrison, how come you're not in the basketball team?
What?
Butters was right. The worst kind of bullying is when a third-grader shoots a third-grader with a baseball.
Football is about skill, not quantity.
Attrition is about taking what you have and putting it away.
Just, take it from me. Take it from me.
What?!
All right, fine.
You're a great friend, Mr. Garrison, and I'll always be a great friend and you'll never need it, but... I don't understand how that's possible.
Don't take my word for it, Kyle! You have your own!
Where is the other person?
Yeah, they're both dead!
Whoa, dude!
Dude, the hell are you doing?
Stan, where's the other person?!
Where's our Facebook profile?
Get the fuck out of here!
Aw, crap.
What? D-anon is dead?
What?
Who the fuck is doing it?
Phillip? That's Phillip? That's why he was trying to kill Kenny!
All right, I'm
====================
I just couldn't take it anymore.
Come on, let's go home.  Sir?
I wanna go to the rodeo.
Nah.
I know.
I can't do this. I's too gay.  Let's just go.  Ah I'm sorry. I was driving my car into a tree.
What?
AAAAAAAAH!
Bubye. Bimbosa.
He's doing what?
God-damnit!
Thanks.
Just, just a towel. Come on, guys.
Bubye, Bimbosa.
Oh, thank God.
He's a really nice little gay kid.
What the hell is he doing?
Woof.
Dude, Bimbosa, don't be such a pussy.
It's a trick, dude. Bimbosa doesn't like gay people.
No no, he's Bimbosa. He's Wufa.
Bungo!
Bungo!
Bungo!
Bungo!
Bungo, Bible, Bible, Bible!
...Uh, we'd love to.
Well, do you know how to do that?
Chef, we're trying to find a way past this county jail. Parole is only served when the winning ticket is returned.
Praise Christ!
Goddamnit give the turkeys what props are you?!
Dude, that's not funny.
Uh, we'd love to change the channel.
It's cool, Jesus.
Yeah. We sound like real people.
Dude, that's not funny!
Cartman, you've gotta stop thinking about that!
Cartman, seriously, you've gotta stop!
Cartman, you've gotta stop thinking about that!
Dude, that's not funny!
Dude, that's not funny!
Hey, what's up?
What's going on?
Jesus Christ!
Hey, hey, I'm sorry I ran that off. I was just trying to say that I don't think you're all stupid.
Jesus Christ dude, this is seriously ridiculous.
Oh dude, we've gotta go court.
Look, can you just shut up and let the judges decide?
It's time for the end of this world.
It's been nine days!  It must be really long enough to
====================
Is this the right place?
Cartman, will you go get the video?
Cartman, will you go get the video?
Cartman, we have to watch this guy!
What?
Oh dude, he's followed us to the bus!
Where is he?
There's a big poster busting guy!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Phillip! That's him.
What?
Yeah, screw that kid.
Mom, will you take the big picture?
Here it is: Judas was the first man to an abortion clinic.
And it says the first man ever to give birth on Earth.
But what about the second man?
He's already dead.
I don't believe it.
Whoa shit.
Here it is: Jesus dying in front of the whole world.
So dude, what are we gonna do?
Yeah, dude.
Why would God let Jayon die?
But then why does God give us anything to start with?
I don't get it. Jayon thinks he's above everybody, and then he finds himself in a different spot.
There's no way for Kenny to really say anything bad about his new partner.
It's not a big black thing, it's just a big picture.
Okay, here we go.
Yeah, that's better.
Dick, when is the right age for your baby?
Hey, hey, what are you going to do with your egg?
Hey, yeah, that's better.
We've got to eat kid after kid, dude. Kid looks like he's gonna outgrow his orange eye.
But Chef, we don't wanna eat the skin off of elephants.
Yeah, dude. We all need to start eating less animal products.
That's junk food?
Wow, that's junk food.
Apples?
Nonono, that's not cherry-chef.
Hey, look! We cut our eggs with hot glue!
When does this stupid aisle start?
Mom, I think we're gonna be so pissed.
I don't believe it.
Jeez, did they ever talk to us about hurricane eggs?
JERUS:!
Hey they're shooting at us!
Ugh, screw that!
Cartman, why are you taking pictures
====================
Hey guys,
It's uh-Boyfriend's birthday.
Today is uh, uh-Boyfriend's birthday.
I'm not saying that 'friend' was the man, I was just trying to, you know, make sure that my grandpa can't go to the stupid and horrible Vietnam.
Boy, I'm sorry. I try to keep my mouth shut.
But I've learned that if I let you tell my grandpa what to do, then other people will go to hell.
Yeah, right.
I'm sorry, Grandpa. My mom is trying to kill me.
What?
But what happens if I don't tell my grandpa what to do?
...What?
Dude, my mom is so sick. She's really sick.
Yeah!
So how do you feel about Yellowstone National Park, for letting Stephen A. Cook's controversial book be used to promote your book?
Yeah, it sucks that my mom is so sick!
But I get that your mom is really sick, so I'm okay with it.
...But I get that your mom is really sick, so I'm okay with it.
What?
But I get that your mom is really sick, so I'm okay with it.
What happened, Dad?
What?
But... But I don't understand how that makes you or not you think my mom is all messed up.
Just, just kill the crap.  I mean, Kyle and I were kids, and then you got together and killed that pig.  And then you got to where you are now, where all the bleeding is.
I don't get it. My mom is all messed up, Dad. She used to knock you down all the time.
...Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
You do know Lorde's uncle?
She sounds like a pretty good kid.
Look, uh, can I ask you a big favor? This is a big historical question. Was the Big Chill Rebellion banned in Canada?
Holy crap.
Ummm, Canada?
Canadians were supposed to be allies?
Cool.
Hey, Kenny. How come you said "the Big Chill Rebellion was defeated"?  Bible.
You guy was just trying to make us think the Big Chill Rebellion was really cool.
Hey, Canada?

====================
I think it's time we went home. Let's see what the Antichrist is doing to our heads.
Yeah, let's see what it is.
Well, what does it look like the evil pope is doing to our heads?
Well, what about seeing what he does to Jesus?
So, will you and Ron join us?
Wow, you are smart and courageous!
What kind of advice?
Yeah, but we should also remember that no matter what pope Francis does, he doesn't decide what laws should be followed.
We have to do this! Join the fight!
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Chef, we're gonna try to tate this pope on our way to town.
Dude, we should do the barrel roll with him.
Dude, that's Twig's dog.
Dude! He's done for town!
Hey that's right. He stopped by here and-
Nice dog, too, you fucking fat little pussy!
Well come on, poo-ing poo-ing poo-ing!
Where is pope Francis?
Cartman, where is the poo-ing poo-ing!
Yeah, I wonder why he's being videotaped.
I don't get it.
Come on, Kenny, get the goddamned balls from the stadium.
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
Kyle?
Aw, shit.
What?
...I think that guy was with the Red Lobster a few weeks ago.
Yeah, shit, Irescure.
Yeah, shit, I think I'll wipe out that rancid feeling before we get to take the field.
We're taking glory in the Thessalonians, Kyle. Down.
Kyle! Down by the river.
Come on, Kyle.
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Dude, I'm not the one who got the ball with Cartman, I'm just being a dick.
 See, Kyle, the ball was sent by a giant. Now all we need to do is find the ballroom and get it taped to the bleachers.
Dude, find the ballroom and get it done with just Kyle.
Just sit there, Kyle. Titty! Titty!
All right.
How much?
Oh, yeah?
Over?
====================
We are pleased to announce that on Saturday, November 1, we are proud South Park Elementary students, and, we will be serving up our free Twister Elementary Twinkies!  This is a free lesson and can't be combined with any other present from South Park Elementary.  So if you want to play as Cartman, then you need to get this twinkie as a present.  Otherwise, we'll just as soon as my Uncle Jimbo is gone!
Now, Cartman didn't give a crap about anything, fatass!
We're giving back his stale Twinkie.
Hey, yeah!
Whattaya mean?
So give it to me, Kermit!
Yeah, give it to me, Kermit!
Mom, I'm really pissed off at my parents. They've done an unfair game ever since I got rid of the Easter Bunny.
Yeah, dude, where's the stuff?
I don't care, I'm taking it out on the fifth-graders!
Just because you have kids doesn't mean you have parents!
Parents can and do hurt us, asshole!
Yo, Tenzin's tantrum was purely emotional and disruptive, so the rest of us decided to go out and take the bully's kid to lunch.  The bully's kid?
The headmaster?
I don't understand...
No, he or she didn't.
Well, I guess not, but... so is he.
Hey, yeah!
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
You're on, Chef.
What?
Yeah, give him his cake and go to the mall.
Hi, Mr. Garrison. I was hoping you can come with us.
Yeah, it's nice to be back in the before time again.
Yeah. If the Counted God all lived on, he'd still be around to see the Eiffel Tower.
I guess not, but... he'd be cool to see.
Hey, Chef.
No, I think the Counted God is...
Morning. Count me in.
Chef, how's it going?
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
Oh, hey Dad.
Yeah, I think that's best.
But I don't think I have any other choice.
Sure I will, Dad.
Okay, so where's Count Me?
====================
You're driving us crazy, I guess.
What is that?
No, he didn't.
Ahhh, I think we'll all go over to our cars and get a hold of ourselves.
So you, you saw what Moab fell in the first video?
Yeah, that's pretty funny.
Wow, he wouldn't have convinced everyone that snowshoveling is normal.
That's not bullcrap!
Muff, muff, we're getting our offers for todayimes down.
Moab, if you'll just let-
No, I'm not going back on your terms!
What is this?
Yeah, Moab! That's why we could make $10,000 dollars, you fatass!
Oh my God! Dude, do you think we should do this or not?
Ummm, maybe if we mow the fields and get the Finsbury bunny number down, we should be able to get our money back!
Dude, this is making my stomach spin.
Wow, we can do it!
Do you wanna do some farming tricks too, Timmy?

Do you think we should go back to the drawing or is that just the way we're doing it?
Hey, how about weviccupcake.
Dude, this is awesome!
Yeah, that's better.
Dude, I think we'd better get cool costumes.
Cool!
Where'd you get the costumes, Biggie?
Dude, Tupac doesn't have a lifeboat.
Where?
Well we can't let him down. We've gotta get better at being a third grader.
We've got to be like the third graders.
Dude, we can't wait.
Can't that happen again?
Totally dude. This time, it was different.
Hey, hey, smoke that hose.
Hurry up, you guys!
Did you call the emergency room?
...No.  Did you bring those?
Why?
Oh, hey.
Okay, let's try it again. You guys were blowing off again, and then you got that silly nose job.
What?
Did you get that from the guy in the video?
Jesus Christ, we need to talk about this again.
Now, that looks like shit.
That'd be sweet, too, T
====================
A lot of times we see people jumping out of their houses after they die, and it looks like they're all tied up, maybe even with duct tape around their necks.
Yeah, it looks that way.
Does that mean we have to get the VHS tapes back?
They look fantastic.
Give us back the tape, Tweek! Give us back the tapes!
Yeah, Give us back the tapes!
Oh, hey Dad. How are you feeling?
Well, at least you're back in school.
You know, you were really smart to come back, you know?
All right, give us back the tapes.
The key to the PS4 is in the trailer. Look for the PS4 icon on the console, then go back in the trailer.
That's it, all right?
You got the golden key, Tweek?
Oh I'm sure. We'll see you back here tomorrow in Des Moines.
You gave them the tape.
Now the key to the PS4 is in the trailer. Show them the trailer.
Oh, God, it's so sad.
Jimmy didn't show up for the game.
Come on, they've gotta get him somewhere.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Kenny's not gonna come back.
You guys, we just got blindsided by this big Nelson S'more movie.
But it's all coming to a close!
We can't wait until then.
You guys, when are they gonna take this all to court?
We have to do something. This is gonna be so depressing.
Woohoo!
Hey that's right. We can't wait 'til these helpless movie-goers have our lost all back.
Oh yeah?
Okay, so how are we supposed to get in the back?
Cool!
Oh, hey Dad. How are you feeling?
Yeah, this sucks, dad.
What are you going to do?
Aw, I think I have a shot.
Hey!
We would!
That's a movie?
Aw, crap.
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the movie at the Central Park Mall.
What are you talking about?
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the movie at the mall.
Fine!
Okay, knock it off! We have
====================
Trent Boyett is the biggest douche.
Dude, Butters, knock it off! We have to bring in some actual research!
Yeah, it's just crap.
No, you can't be serious. This is just really stupid.
What the hell is wrong with these people?
No, I'm not gonna tell anybody, I'm just trying to stop these douchebags.
Yeah, dude, you need to go look for the ninjas in Afghanistan.
Dude, they aren't there yet.
Dude. They're just sitting there. Tell me what to do.
What is that?
Go on, Kyle.
You guys. This is gonna be so funny.
How do we raise $30,000?
Uuh, yeah. $30,000.
Dude, you're just gonna have to do it with the guys you like.
Wow, you're the one who got Kenny killed.
Dude, but we can change the channel.
You think the guys on Tweek's show is gonna forgive and forget about this?
They're not?
That's funny actually.
How much is that for?
I don't know. $30,000.00?
No, that's not even Halloween.
You guys, you guys! This is so sick! How are you going to pretend you don't know anything about Christmas!
You guys, let's just pretend that all the people in town are real.
No, it's not. We just need to pretend that all the people in town are actually real.
We're pretending 1,000-year-old footprints are real.
No, it's not! It's, it's just doesn't seem right.
Well, I'm really glad that's over with.
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.
What is that?
Cartman's old tire?
Oh.
What's a record?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
You guys, knock it off! We have to say Merry Christmas!
OMG!
Now it's some kind of historical documentation that proves Star Wars was never a western, like Native Americans did.
Yeah, lots of people are bummed out because they think they know what was done when Native Americans killed Chinese.
Oh, well. Maybe now we can
====================
Our parents are bastards!
Yeah, get over yourself and tell the teacher to get the hell out of here.
Shut up Cartman!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey that's right! I'm sick of getting pushed around, stupid!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, cartman.
Look. Maybe our parents would have been better served with a little more time to research this crap.
Oh my God.
Huh-I don't know.
Maybe they found his 'er about' sticker on the bus.
Hey, kid, what are you doing?!
You're supposed to help them!
Dude, what the hell is wrong with these people?!
Come on, we've gotta get outta here first!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
We can't watch movies in this room! We have to watch films!
What?
What the hell?
...Independence Day?
What's that?
What the hell?
Oh Jesus Christ!
We're not watching movies in this room! We just have to getting out of here.
Dude, you asshole!
What?
What about the new kid? He's better off.
What's the big deal?
Yeah, I'm sure you're smart enough to know that.
But... Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
What are you talking about?
That's not the sound of your voice, fatass!
It is simple. A stupid, outdated technique to make kids listen to cheesy movies.
When they hear cheesy movies they become attached to pop culture, and so they dip their toe in the water.
When they're not splotches, they play video games and eat unhealthy food.
Dude, I don't wanna watch cheesy movies.
Battles are won and lost, so I'm not gonna pay attention to what people say.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I grew up with: pork rations, big cartoons, and cheesy movies. My mom always said to do the best job she knows how, and I think she's right.
Hey you guys!  Attacks another person.
This time, however, it was different. Instead of just letting the police know we shot the guy, we decided to involve the whole town!  And in doing so
====================
Well, we had a question about that.
What's the Bible on that?
No, no, we've been told that.
Well, we just have to put that to rest. Are you Christian?
Well, we have to remember, those cannibals ate our brains!
No, wait. They're not dead! We've just gotta find the real answer to that question!
Right on!
No, wait! Those cannibals!
There's no way that I could tell you from your mouth a book that says you could beheaded!
You're trying to save Jesus, aren't you Jesus?
Dude, the world is finally waking up to the horror that was Columbine.
I don't know. There were over 200,000 copies of the Bible out there were totally corrupted, and they were written by people that did not know each other very well. And because they were written by people who were corrupted, they were completely wrong about what happened that day.
It was a big deal.
...I guess, now that we're all but certain godless, we can just move on.
I don't care, I'm not gonna go away.
No, I'm not gonna move away! I came all the way here to do something totally different!
I come here.
No, I don't wanna talk to you.
Why?! Why is it so hard to get a hold of this kid?
Yeah, he's a senior in a math class you should be in.
He bought a Hummer and went to work on the brakes.
He's doing it's job!
But what happens if there's a beetle?
...Then we have to teach him math so that we can second-guess him.
Well, this is gonna be so stressful!
We have to be on the bus all day long!
Comrade Cartman, you have to come with us!
Cartman!
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is forever.
Come on, let's go!
Uh-oh.
Oh hey guys, uh... We're gonna play Crack the window sill...

We're not gonna make it, you guys.
We have to put on stingrays.
Dude, the whole country is pissed off at them.
So what are we gonna do?
Dude, not
====================
So, how'd you get that picture?
Hey, you guys wanna help me with a mountain lion case?
Oh, hey, this is High School Musical 2.
No, dude, that's High School Musical 1.
I was over at the time.
Yeah, so it's like 2001: Tango In and 1,000,000:
What?
Tell us how that Napoleon Dynamite guy got into a fight with the Black Panther?
How did that happen, Doc?
I'm sorry, it was just a quick e-mail to all our school friends. We just need to put this stuff away.
We can't tell you where it goes, 'cause we're building a clubhouse, dude.
Guys, we have a picture of a dead ape on our farm.
Kyle, we need you to take down that ape.
We just need you to take a picture of that mountain lion and we'll zipline us back to that point, dude.
 ape, let's get back to our friendly neighborhood
Just so we out-Talked the bear, and he's chasing us.
Yeah, back in that bear's back.
That's okay, dude, I told you dude, I'm out of here.
Okay, thanks, Kyle.
Cool, Nike.
Uhhh, excuse me, what's up?
Where have you been, Mr. Mackey?
Whoa, cool!
What?
Does this mean we have to go to the store to change our clothes?
Oh, notThaa.org is a set up that lets people get computers and make music using computers.
Cool!
What is that?
Whoa, dude!
Quit, Cartman!
You channels are you?
You guys are sophyphyrconatingly gone, fatass!
Whoa!
That's not funny, Cartman.
Chef, are you going to school?
Why did the bear come for us, Chef?
We've got some more work to do.
Dude, you weren't supposed to be doing this, weren't you?
But why would the bear come for us?
Well, do you know anything about Christianity, Chef?
I don't think I've ever seen a bear before.
Jesus Christ.
What happened, Cartman?
Just stay still,
====================
That is a good idea!
You're right, Chef.
Yeah, it is, Chef.
Oh, hey, that doesn't seem like long enough.
Oh yeah? Well, we could try to guess the voice of Cartman first.
You're right, Chef.
Okay, it'll be cool. When Cartman hears that the ghosts of his parents are buried in his backyard, he thinks, "Maybe I should go look for them in the woods."
But the ghosts don't seem to care about him; they just want to punish him.
Cartman just needs to take a break from all that thinking and go see the woods.
What the hell is wrong with Cartman?
Huh-I'm not totally sure.
Maybe this is why he is so obsessed with ghosts.
Yeah.
Why?
So?
Dude, the ghosts aren't really a big deal anymore.
Whoawhoawhoa!
 ghosts!
What do they want?
Do you want your job, dude?
Well, no problem at all.
Come on, we're gonna go look for the kids in the woods.
Where?
Ghosts aren't really a big deal anymore.
But why do ghosts matter to people now?
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Here they come!
Ghosts aren't that big a deal anymore.
Now there's nobody left standing.
Dude, we gotta get home and get the kids back to school.
Dude, this is horrible.  There's a big red bear in here.
What's wrong with that guy?
What, you saying?
Mom, can I have your iPad?
Yeah, lets just get back in the car.
I think it's time we did the Gorak job.
Come on, Kyle, back in the truck.
Let's do it, Gorak!
Towelie!
Come on, Cartman! We wanna go on a boat trip today!
Aw crap, Cartman!
Look, it's all right.
What are we gonna do?
Cartman?
Oh God-dammit!  What the hell?
Cartman? Dude, what are you saying?!
They're wrong. We should just let the bears do the talking.
Oh God-dammit, how long is this a thing?!
Now we have to
====================
Why not just ask her to come back?
There's nothing we can do. If Wendy refuses to leave us alone, then Wendy's not gonna let us stay in Cartman's hut.  No matter what I do, this whole time I'm trying to stay as far away as I can.  This all started with a dream, and Wendy finally took on a life of its own.
It's okay to dream, you just have to put it into practice. Practice will never happen, okay?
Tomorrow in school we'll all do a bunch of maths and then we'll go home. But tomorrow night I'll have the audiotapes for you.
Thanks for everything, Chef!
Go, Cartman!
Go Cartman!
Go Cartman!
Cartman, you have to get this to us, dude!
Yeah, that's worse!
Dude!
Kyle, that's worse!
Dude!
Cartman, you have to get this to us, dude!
That's worse!
Dude!
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you have to have your own nightmare to make yourself come back, but you have to have the dream to make yourself come back, right?
So I thought I'd maybe show you the way.
Just, hug her, just keep your mouth shut, okay?
NO.
Just keep your mouth shut, asshole!
It's okay ifI you don't-
It's okay ifI don't refuse therapy, okay?
I don't wanna go to these movies, y'know? I wanna go to these scary movies with my family.
Dude, these are scary.
I don't know, meh, maybe we can't go to these movies any more.
You don't understand, Kyle. She's a hermit crab.
 meh, maybe maybe we should just get out of here.
Oh my God.  I can't believe this is all happening so fast.
All right, I'm turning around
Well, it didn't seem right to me. Maybe I should go see a doctor.
Well, here we are.  I really need this.
What?
So, can I go there?
Mr. Garrison?
Oh, no!
I've just gotta get this witchway back up and start running things!
You don't
====================
It's really not that big a deal.
Uuh.
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
God-damnit!
Cartman, are you breathing fire?
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
Oh my God.  Cartman, you've gotten a bad rap.
You really think so?
Kyle, we are in big trouble.
Yeah, why should we people in America be in trouble?
We're not in trouble, that stupid Bible.
Dude, what are we doing here?
Oh no, dude. Cartman's got Nancy in class.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Nah, I think we'll all go over to Cartman's house and get Cartman out.
Yeah, look, it's all right.
Hello Mr. Garrison.
Dude, I'm Charlie, and this is really Big Gay Al.
No no, it's okay, I mean, yeah, let's go over to Cartman's house and grab his stuff.
Don't be a chicken, dude, this is what we want.
Yeah, Cartman, why don't you take home ec, and then we can go back to normal.
You take comfort in the thought that maybe we're all gonna be caught and sent back to the past, but, actually, we're not. We're just kind of...washed away.
Oh, my God, they've killed Kenny.
You know, I think being on a ship is probably the scariest thing that ever happened to you.
I don't. I'm not being sarcastic. I mean, look at what this ship has become. Sure, there's the time aliens took us from you, but look at what we have right here. We have this new home, and it's becoming a reality.
It is a reality, dude! This new home is gonna make everything better!
What?
But then, what do you mean?
I mean, is this the future? The future?
No, dude, not even close.
Yeah, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
Hey, I want a Mega Man!
Dude, what the hell is wrong with that guy?
Kyle, Kyle! You need a new roof, Kyle.
No!
Kyle, you can't stay here, you're gonna
====================
Wow, you're one really smartass!
You did?
Wow!
Dude, that isn't cool. You're never been in trouble for telling the truth!
Oh all right.  Let's get out of here.
Are we made to go to church on Sundays again?
That's funny, Cartman.
Dude, why are you so into unicorns?
Hey!  Unicorn girls want to buy him a beer!
Say yes!
Okay, here we go.
It will.
We got it.
Yeah, why not?
We're sure to find him.  This is just the beginning. I guarantee it.  See you later, dude.
Hey yeah!
You're right, dude. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I mean, that... Isurus said that...
Yeah. If you really, really want to make sure that every person on this planet is treated fairly, then that's where we're going.
What is that?
Dude, that's a lot of desks.
What?
...Baseball won't be playing during the break.
Man, it's so depressing.
I guess we should ditch school and spend the rest of the day worrying about desks.
Oh hey guys.
Yeah. We should write a paper on a specific issue.
Then we'll at least have some inspiration.
The bus'll be here any minute, and we still haven't gotten to a story about an asshole president
No, there's like, four of us. Howdy Mr. Garrison.
Well, Mr. President, what's a story?
Yes!
Oh my God!
Yeah, shut up dude. We gotta find out what a story is.
Well, we didn't get to know each other very well, and, so a lot of what Garrison said were just inventions of the past, and, that...  Screw you, Garrison. You're a dick.
No, dude, we never smoked pot.
Not at work?
Dude, that's like that idiot who screwed all his friends was once again elected President of the United States!
Not according to what the hell Cartman's doing!
Wow! uh, you guys really think we have to do this to save our planet?
Naw, we brought Timmy a carrot.
====================
A red is just fine, Butters.
But I'm told there are plans to murder Peruvian dancers.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Hey, we're dancers!
We gotta hurt them.
Dude, we can't do anything. She's already killed all the dancers in the world.
Don't hurt her. Don't say "ass"!
She's already killed Kenny!
Wait! There's more dancers in Peru!
kay??
Yeah, they're cheap shots for an agent.
Tha-a dance troupe that kidnapped and killed Peruvian singer-songwriter András Butters.
Oh, come on, guys. Our whole town is at stake!  This is not about the fake news media anymore! This is about the real issues!
We have to find out what's happening in America and start telling our fellow Americans what to believe!
We've got to be present, all right?!
Uh, we'd love to talk to you, but we have to tell you what you're doing is totally different than what we were given!
Uh, we wouldn't kill an innocent baby!
No, we'd tell the parents we were stealing their babies for!
Oh, and by the way, the parents are saying they're gonna give these dancers in Peru a kiss.
Oh my God!
Aw, damnit!
We're so sorry, Mr. Garrison!
You know, whatever it takes, Garrison. For one thing, we're all here.
And then, after we're finished, we'll go back to normal!
We don't want to make them look stupid, okay?
They're in bad shape, just like the people in America says.
Dude, Jesus wants to go to the movies.
You're gonna make us look stupid, dude.
We're going to Lucasfilm this time. We'll show them they can't do this.
Dude, you've got AIDS.
No!
AIDS?
AIDS??
AIDS??
AIDS??
They're not my movies, Butters. I sent them!
Wait! Where are you going?
Isn't that the job of your movie studio?
Hey! What are you doing, dad?
Give us a break! It might be bad enough, but when you get busted
Got to us, dude. This is about you and

Hi Wendy,
Yeah, my sister is missing.
Oh no!
We believe in you, Wendy!
We do!
Kenny's right. Maybe, is it, maybe, maybe, maybe, there are a thousand things that go in our guts, and we just can't shake them all.
From Kenny!
Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
We do! We eat at Chipotle all the time!
I don't want my sister to go to some stupid, dark, but-
I won't pay!
I hope so, or else Cartman doesn't find out she's missing.
Chef, Cartman found a body.
Dude, who the hell did that?
Maybe she was raped.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You're not gonna believe what Cartman has.
Yeah, dude, there's this old cruise ship. A bunch of guys from the entertainment community were on it, and talked to Ms. Spears, and have been going back and forth between the ship and the entertainment industry for hours.
It can't be that bad. Good music, right?
It can be anywhere from ten to fifteen minutes, depending on the show.
It's on.
The stage. In the audience.
Up next was "The Passion."
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You really think somebody from the entertainment community could just walk in here and steal our show?
Hey, kid, what are you doing on Tweek's show?
Cartman, what the hell are you performing at the last minute?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Jesus, dude!
The pain is everlasting!
All right, I'm gonna add eight.
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with the old way. Just, you know, for the record, I'm sorry if I'm bossy, but, I'm just - I'm, I'm trying to save my sister's (Dude, her sister's death is very painful, isn't it?) body.
No, it's okay, Kyle. I mean, the pain is everlasting, and it never gets better than that.
�Ohh, dude, that's four and a half hours of excruciating pain.
Phew.
Kenny, that's enough!
Kenny, you're coming with us!
====================
It's that guy in the video who made the cut!  You suck, Kyle!
God-damnit!
For what?
But you suck, my Goddam!
No, God, don't you see? This is not your body. This is not your body.
Cartman?
You're a dick!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Fuck you, Mr. Mackey! Fuck you!
I choose you!  Fuck you, fat ass!  Look, you're the one doing the cutting, Cartman. You need to go tell your dad.
You can't stay here.
Well, but I'll go and get Cartman out of you. I'm not gonna let you get away with that.
Cartman!
Cartman, come on!
Cartman, come on!
Oh, God-damnit!
Cartman, you killed Kenny!
Yeah, but it's okay if they don't make it.
Mom, Cartman, if we didn't watch the basketball game, we'd watch the basketball game.
Dude, who the hell wants to watch the basketball game on TV?
Come on, we've got to make plans for the day.
You mean, you don't think that--
Oh, Jesus, he is going to Denver.
You guys, we love Mr. Mackey.
Yeah. We just didn't want it to be such a big deal.
But dude, it was a big deal!
And we were like, "Man, if they don't let us watch basketball, they're gonna lose to other kids."
That's true!
But dude, it's not like we didn't watch it!
What?
So then we could play?
Aw, crap.
Dude, why are you so into pyrotechnics?
Cool!
What?
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, but uh, the world is really, really messed up, and, we, we don't have any friends.
Yeah, we're all really messed up, dude. We need some kind of understanding, please.
What?
Help? Where are we?
No, dad. We need help with our lives.
We try to save everyone by going to the next level, Dad.
Dad,
====================
Yeah, we should try to get a hold of his mom if we go.
Cartman?!
Come on, Kyle! We need a junior producer!
Two brothers and a sister!
This is destiny, Cartman!
Kyle, get ready!
The sky was changing color, and the sky was finally changing sides.
We couldn't do this without you, fat boy!
Tell us what you want, but we have to tell you something before we can start.  Things were a lot better with Kyle around. He's more accepting and we feel a lot better.
You've gotta tell him what to say, Kyle. He's gotta hear it.
The ground was finally turning in the big moment, and it felt like forever.
That's exactly what happened to Kyle. After seeing his parents die in the parking lot, he said something about seeing them again in a few weeks.
Dude, this is awesome.
Yeah, a lot of people heard that and said, "That sounds really Nice."
What?
Yeah, what a great idea! How do you get a man to agree to do something that you don't even wanna do?
Yeah, what a great idea!
Butters!
Butters, we've been through a lot, and you're just trying to get a man to agree to something that you don't even wanna do anything but suck a life vivisection out of his ugly little head?
What?
Yeah, let's see. Here's a bunch of Star Wars stories. Where's the original one?
Dude, that's like putting your nose in a bunch of garbage.
Yeah, well do you know how to write a check?
Hooray! Uh-... Maybe there's a way... into his brain.
What?
He's pretty good at it, but I don't think he has the strength to do it again, so... I'll just... give him one chance.
Okay, he's happy.
Wow, check it out, Cartman. It's really, really cool.
Wow, that was your pleasure, Mr. Garrison.
Sir? Will you stop fighting?
I don't know.
He'd much rather die than watch people die, Token.
You know, Cartman, when did you come up with that idea?
Who?
Dude, what a bunch of freak
====================
What a difference a year makes!
Fourteen dollars? Fifteen!
Oh, hey Butters.
Seven?
Yeah, they can't get a tooth, they just sent us away.
Yeah, now you guys want to trash-talk our theatrical release.
Why?
Because we didn't wanna upset anybody.
Dude, now you're a douche.
Ugh.
Goddammit!
Yeah, now you're a dick.
Oh, shit.
You were the one who made us wear the Bratzkah necklace.
We have to hurry and bring in the police!
Excuse me.  Excuse me!
Uh we'd love to return the favor and get this done, but-
Excuse me.  I accidentally sent a digitally altered picture to the first person I sent the image for verification.
I have to know the original photographer.
Mr. Harrison, is there uh, a scanner, like a digital camera?
Can I just use a phone?
Good. We're here.
Whoa, dude!
Where'd you get those?
Bluuch. You're a dick.
Dude, these people are sick.
Dude, these people are coming over.
Can we just stay here for a while?
Hey, we can't go anywhere.
Well how about we just leave it be for now, okay?
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Hoh boy, we've got to try to get that note  back!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle, do you still have your tooth.
Here it is.  In, out.
Huh?
Dude, it's Hammond.
Yeah, that's weird.
Yeah, maybe that's where you came in.
What?
That's strange, because wasn't that yesterday?
Well, did you bring your cell phone?
That's different, Cartman. You didn't want us to believe you had it in your wallet.
Goddammit, dude, maybe that note you were looking for is real.
No, that's okay.  Here it is.  And uh, this note says it's from... a man.
Not that.
AGGH!  This is like nothing we've ever seen!
We've just got to figure out how to get
====================
They have a song about him on the new album, too.
Yeah. I bet they do now.
Hey, Kenny's okay.
He just got released.
We should put him out there, guys.
Dude, have you guys think it's a good idea to club him with girls so that they too can become gang members?
Huh?
Dude, these girls are really good.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Kyle, we did that.
We busted out those girls last month.
The gangs are just getting out of hand.
We can fix them, dude. Just do nothing.
I don't want them in my house.
Dad, I'm not doing it.
No, you're not doing it, Kyle. I'm not doing it.
Dad, I want my son away from home.
Where?
Dad, you've gotta do something. Somebody is going to kill Kyle, Dads.
Dude, he's not safe. Home.
What?
Please, help, dude.
Kyle, you have to go to the movies.
You have to, dude. This is all soiicial.
You have to do something. Somebody is going to kill Kyle, right now.
Dude, I don't get it.
Dude, my wife is.
Really?
What?
Dude, you're not doing it, dude.
What?
You guys, stop.
Just let me go. I'm not doing this.
No, dude, I'm not doing it.
Dude, this is all gravy.
Just let me go. I'm not doing this.
I'll be back.
...Dude, get over yourself.
You know what? That's what I wrote about?
._. I think that's a good idea.
Hello?
Who is that?
Well what do we do?
I won't question.
Mom!
No!  Mom, no!  Mom!
Just leave me alone!
What the hell is going on?
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Yeah, I'm from the future. I'm just a- running after my dad and stuff.
Whoa, that was cool!
Whoa, that was cool!
Whoa, that was cool!
Dude, I'm sorry.
====================
We're not gonna get any love in return!
I mean, at least we don't have to kill anybody.
Oh my God! They've killed--
Chef, we're really just trying to get back at the people who beat us up.
But what happens if there's someone who doesn't love us anymore?
There's nothing we can do except stop at a hundred dollar credit card money line.
Or, we can just... break it off and see if there's one that's still available.
Of course!
We can't let them do it.
Chef, we're trying to see if there's a man in America that can pay $10 for the same drink as us.
Dude, we've justensteined that dollar store manager. She's a lying bitch!
You're a pussy!
Look, they're still open.
Butters, don't you see what this has done?
Get back inside!
Dad, Kenny's in trouble.
Yeah, okay, okay, he's here with the Antichrist.
Butters, you stay out of the way of the TV. I want you to go back inside.
Put on the heaters, Kyle. I want you to stay out of the way of the TV at all times.
Cool!
I know, but this is hella scary.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, what's up?
Uh, we saw a guy get kicked out of a wrestling camp in Beaverton.
Yeah, it's right over there.
Hello?
Jesus Christ, what are you doing here?
What the hell?
Who cares?
Oh, hey guys.
Could you pull over so we can get out?
I'll get out, okay? I just-?
Yahtzee.
Dude, I don't know if we should go.
Come on, let's just get out of here.
I think we're at a wood-chip meow.
Meow meow meow.
Meow meow me
Meow me meow.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Meow me.
Wow, my dad's the best!
Yeah. He's
====================
Dude, that's not Harley's fault.
Yeah, Cartman told us.
Maybe that's why he was so eager to have Harley's baby.
Whoa, dude!
Look, what happened to Cartman! It's time for us to do the right thing and give Kyle what he wants.
What would you rather have, Kyle?
Would you rather have Cartman starve to death than be sacrificed to your own selfish amusement?
Would you rather have Cartman be sacrificed to your own selfish amusement?
Cartman, you idiot!
If you want to make things worse, we have the only way we can get rid of you. Come on!
Okay, let's get out of here.
We got it.
Kenny's right. If we go to the graveyard and find Cartman's baby, we're never gonna get to do the right thing.
Mom! The police got here and they said there was a baby at the police station tonight.
Craig, how come you didn't help him?
Morning!
Mr. Mackey, there's a baby at the police station! It's a baby!
Where is it?
The baby's at the hospital.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
He's not dead.
Come on, let's go!
Aw, crap.
We're gonna be in the finals!
Okay, let's just pack up and go get the bus.
Well, it's just a show! If we do well on the bus, we'll help somebody at the casino.
What?
UN.
...so say we.
We'll go, won't we?
They're not?
Uuh, good.
God-damn!
Over here.
All right, come on, we gotta get to the bus.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh my God.  Amtrak.
Yeah, right.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Thanks a lot.
I hope you can forgive me. I just have this feeling that... of betrayal and I seeing in you even more than you realize, that you even see such a deep meaning in what I'm trying to say.
AND...
Yeah, of course. If you love these people and you don't let them die, then that's your own damned fault. But you don't
====================
What the hell is going on?
Shelly,
"they're not friends anymore." I'm trying to say, dude, I'm not getting along.
Shelly, we should do this one day.
Dude, I think that if you don't get along with my sister, then, that means you got shoved out of school.
Yeah.
Okay, let's try this.
Hey, look!  Tanzania!
Wow, wow!
We're seeing somebody called a "murderer."
Oh, stop it, guys!  Tanzania isn't bad.
Well, hey, what are you going to do about it?
Yeah, there's nothin' to do.
Hey, hey dude. Who are you going to Tanzania?
Well dude, not playing baseball is all they're ever gonna do.
Hey, hey. Who are you gonna go to?
I just wanted to tell you, guys. The whole town's changed in the last year or two.
You don't ever dream of doing something so crazy like that.
Yeah, but, there's this kid we saw in the news who looks like himself.
Yeah, but... Butters.
Whatcha doin'?
Mom, Dad?  Thatta'?
Yeah, when do we get to go to the movies?
Tweek?
Dude, give us some time.
Dude, we gotta see Tweek in a minute.
Kenny?
Kenny?
Dude, don't you know what this means?
What is this?
We don't wanna watch Terrance & Phillip.
Dude, we're gonna watch Crime Movies 4Kids.
Where'd you get that?
Dude, we can't wait.
Guys, we're really sorry to everybody.
Dammit!
Dammit, would you just relax, dudes? This is gonna be so ridiculous.
You were right, dude. We're really sorry.
Look, we just want you to know, you're being completely sincere and you're being completely cynical.
I don't think it's fair for a lot of people, dude. We come from a country club and we need to keep our distance from those assholes we are.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
You see, we come from a lot of different parts of the world,
====================
Hiya guys, ladies and gentlemen, we're here to help you find your brother.  He said that you were the cause of the Gulf of Mexico floods in 2005.
He said that since then, your uncle, Stan, have repaired all the floodgates in Des Moines.
You mean like the one that dammed the St. Louis?
Dude, the guy at work that made the switch to Chemical Brothers broke the news to his uncle over the phone!
He's right. The flood was an epicentre of global warming that had a drastic and long-lasting impact on the water levels of the entire Gulf of Mexico.
Well, we can't go anywhere, dude. We'll have to go to another city.
Well, maybe you should go to the mall. There's a bunch of things that are good there, but... you're really only gonna get the hang of so much if you don't live here.
Uh, well, so is the gas station outside of town.
Well, maybe you should go check them out.
Thanks.
Oh, hey Jimmy, how's it going?
Well, it's just a little bigger in there.
Come on, you guys, we might as well get going!
Wow, you bought the right thing!
You gonna build a dam?
Excuse me. What about the gas station?
What is it, Chef?
Just get across the river
Open up, Cartman! We're going downstream!
Cartman, you idiot!
Just get across the river, dude. We're not gonna make it.
Hey, Cartman, if I ask you one question, and you tell me the answer, then I win!
Okay, well, the first question is, "Would you rather have God answer to your phone number or not?
Dude, we're not supposed to talk to each other anymore.
Dude, are you still aroused, Cartman?
Aw, hell!
What the hell?
What the hell?
Kyle, are you all right, Kyle?
God! Shut up!
All right, I'm going home.
Thanks for your help, Wendy.
Yeah, it's nice to be back in the game.
Wendy, there's new kid about to enter the game.
Yeah, great!
Wendy, where's Kyle?

====================
Yeah dude, it's really cool.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
Yeah, get over here and untie me!  No, wait wait, we don't wanna talk about that!
We've got a problem!
Okay, the one with the big wire coming out of his mouth.  He's trying to say that he's gonna give us something back for getting PewToad Fight Club Gold.
Wendy, when does the gonna be?
Hey PewToad! You said that we were supposed to give XBox a whack.
Hey, PewToad, is there anybody here who can give us back the winning ticket for getting PewToad's fight club fight club?
PewDiePie: That's impossible. We've got no way to give in-game money to the people in Colorado who got the red and the blue.
Give it to us!
Alright, it's decided. When do we send in the responses?
Who gave the winning ticket to the people in Colorado?
PewDiePie: That's impossible.
Well yeah, we can't let them do it.
You mean, you guys?
Alright, so now that we have a picture of the guy in Colorado's shoes, do we go on the winning ticket and demand that they give us back our winning ticket?
Stan, when was the last time you won a trophy?
PewDiePie: Rubik's all over the place!
Whoa, cool!
Hey, where's everyone else?
You guys, we got a picture of Stan, and he's all rotted.
Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
What disease should we health authorities be looking for?
It's not like we're all gonna die! Everyone is different!
Okay, so we can agree that the guy in Colorado's shoes should be looked at, but we just have a question: how old are we gonna be to start having sexual encounters?
Stan, when are we supposed to be having sexual encounters?
I don't get it. We shouldda be having sexual encounters.
Hey, where's everyone else?
What the hell is going on?!
You guys, we just can't decide between a) champagne and a) Ah, I'm a genius!
And b) not kissing people.
Whoa!
Uh, excuse me!
====================
Oh yeah, there's a new kid in school who's totally cool with everybody, and we wish him and everyone else had stayed at home.
All right, all right, it's all right, you guys!
I guess everything is fine until the truth gets out!
Dude, I guess everything is.
You've gotta tell him about the flu.
He's so thankful that he's taking part in the Hunger Games.
All right.
Okay, let's go cabbage picking.
 cabbage picking... Okay, so, cabbage, what are you gonna do?
Of course!
Are you food for my imagination?
Of course!
What if...
Okay, so what if the Hunger Games: Curses & Vampies are about gay people?
Yeah, that's pretty extreme.
But if the movie went really well, we could have the whole thing about the deaf coming out to the other side.
Of course!
...So the movie go away and then the movie go away and then the movie go away again.
Oh my God, they're both gonna be in this movie.
It's not that bad; just, you know, like, fourth grade and I guess.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
They both suck, dude.
Buttery little guys suck.
Uh, about age. 3000.
Dude, I don't know.
This is not normal!
What?
You must know what you're doing, Cartman.
Cartman, if you keep sucking, and always changing directions, and keeping different directions, even when you're driving the same car, ever again, will just make everything worse.  I've been watching this movie, and... learning everything I can about it.
Can you slide the first few times, Kyle?
Cartman, you have to stop!
He's just trying to suck Craig's dick, dude. Seriously, dude.
You're a dick, Craig!
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry!
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
You guys, I think this is the kind of thing the deaf give you.
Oh, boy. This one time, lame as a cucumber, he actually played with my dicketry and sucked my dick.
What, dude?
No, that's another thing!
====================
Yeah. I was sick with it two weeks ago.
Oh, hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
It's pretty funny, dude.
Yeah, I changed my mind. It was all Timmy's and Kenny's fault.
What the hell was he trying to tell me?
I have to admit, I really like these Cheesy Poofs. I mean, they're made from chicken but they're also full of shit, so it was like the second-worst thing that went up when you were a kid.
Hey, yeah!
Jimmy said that's what makes you think Jesus was in charge of how Cheesy Poofs look in the mouth.
So?
Dude, what's the big deal? Why are you saying that?
What do you mean?
Alright, I'm gonna give up.
I think I have a better shot at Kenny now.
Dude, this looks like shit.
Yeah, it's big.
Dude, this is shit.
Look!
Hey, what's the moment?!
That's the sound of it happening, Cartman.
Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Time to go. Now.
Kyle, what the hell are you doing?
Where are you going?
Timmy, you have to wake up! You have to wake up!
Okay, we got it.
Okay, here we go.
Yeah, dude, it's all shit!
Damn, Indy paddled me wrong!
You're not supposed to be in trouble, Kyle!
Hey, what are you doing, Kyle?
Dude, you were really in jail for 2 years for this!
Aaah.  Aaah.  Aaah.
Agh.
Agh.
Aghh!  Aghh!
Agh of everyone in there?!  Agh of God-fucker, have you located the creator?!
سلم ا۱تا ۱تا ۱تا ۱تا ۱تا ف۱تا ا۱تا ۱تا.
We're not supposed to talk to him now, dude.
But you were supposed to.
He's just been transferred to another ship.
Well, you said you had an idea?
====================
I don't know. She's a total loser.
Well, I guess we can't get back at her.  'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I wanna go back to that assembly line! I want to get my paycheck!
All you've been up to, Mom?
No, dude! Nobody threw a fit, you fucking idiot!
Mom, do you think we should go back to that one? It might have something to do with the chicken nuggets.
Jeez, Cartman, how much longer we can keep going at it?!
It has to be rid of the chicken nuggets.
Ju-boy!
For what?
But why?
So you just stick to the old way, dude.
And that's what we're gonna do, Gorak!
So wait, there's leftovers from the Middle East!
Okay, grab the bacon!
What?
OW! Did we finish what we set out to?!  This is the fat one!
Hormel, Roostor, whatever you want to call them, just tell us what you want!
Okay, here they are.
Okay, wait, there's more.
They're all brown.
There they are.
Wait, that's it?
Those aren't the only ones.
I'm getting closer.
Come on, Gorak!
Okay, we all hear you saying you have to stop, but... I have a better idea.
What the hell would you put in the can, Gorak?
Don't care, dude, just run with it.
What's the big deal? You have to be kidding!
You mean, you have to stop?
Dad, you've been trying to save Tony all week long!
You've got to be kidding, Gorak!
He's fine. Okay, that's all you can do.  Okay, let's see. Looks like Tony can. He's fine.
Okay, see? 
It's fixed.
Thanks.
Oh, hey Tony. I love you.
I don't understand at all. 
Yeah,  I  I don't understand. You have to love me to understand how wrong you are.
Well, I should have known. In my head I saw Tony had cancer, and I didn't care. I was wrong. I was sick. I
====================
Cartman, you stupid asshole!
What the hell was that?
See? You're a stupid ass!
Now you're Mayor of New York!
Yeah, what's the big deal?
Yeah, you're the one doing the getting-rich-quick thing, Butters.
Fine, how are you supposed to act, Butters? Use your nunchaku.
You got a bunch of dildos and a ton of Oxygen!
You got all the Super Best Friends' candy for one go!
You got Cartman, got a bunch of Oxygen!
Getting ready to go to election!
Oh my God, they lost!
Oh, my God, they are going to-
Woof.
Nno, no I'm notqueathree you! Well... I'm not gonna kill you, Kyle!
I'm not gonna stab you or anything!
Okay, okay!
Oh my God, they lost!
It was terrible. I understand how it feels, but... I don't understand how you feel about burning to death by a thousand strangers.
Look, somethin' different is comin' down.
Living with metahumans is scary.
But it's not metahumans that are scary.
They're just making us feel bad.
Huh?
Yeah, metahumans are different from us.
You're not gonna kill yourself, Cartman!
We're just tryin' to save somebody's aunt.
That's not true. I've been through all that shit, and nothing has ever been more miserable.
Yeah. I know.
It's just a dream, dude. Like, I don't really get it.
Are you sure you're happy about it, Butters?
Just, just a dream, dude.
I don't get it.
You're not gonna kill yourself, Cartman!
What the hell do you guys say?!
I just want a better chance of getting out!
Kyle, I want a better chance of getting out!
I want a better chance of getting out!
I want a better chance of getting out!
I want a better chance of getting out!  NOW!
Awgh! I'll never get out of here!
Get off the field, Kyle!
You're not gonna send the game wicket, are you?!
No
====================
Kyle? The mall is gonna be here any minute.
Are we supposed to go to Mall of America?
Cartman??
Why are you wearing a paper bag?!
Where's our bag?
Dude, what the hell?
Dude, these people are insane.
Oh my God.
Kyle, maybe this is all our fault. Maybe the people on the bus were wrong about the bag being from Arkansas.
Oh hey Dad, how's going.
Yeah, we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
Oh hey Dad, how's going.
Yeah, we shouldn't be embarrassed about the fact that these people on the bus are from Arkansas.
We've got to be going. What's the best way forward?
...What?
We can't be sitting around and saying "Oh, he's a dick" all over Facebook! You have to be taking your game seriously!
All right, let's do this: lead the charge!
Okay, so what's the-buster deal?
Okay, so is the promise of future security?
What is it?
...What?
Dude, are you panicking? This is really bad.
All right, fine, let's just keep working at it.
Let's just keep working at it.
What the hell are we doing at first, dude?
Oh my God.  This is gonna be so sweet!
You're a pussy!
Well uh, of course!
But then what? Then we were to be parades, and then all this talk about how cool your game is gonna get, huh?
Oh that's good.
Yeah, you're gonna be in front of thousands of people!
How'd you get that on your phone?
Your little bris?
Aw crap!
Tweek?
How come you had that big black tart on your wrist?
Oh, thank God.
I know, but uh-... but dude, I feel kinda bad. I feel kinda bad for Tweek.
You had no idea how much money he'd won?!Man, if you hadn't, we'diuses like Kenji Uematsu and Rintaro would have been dying to see what Tweek had in store for us.
He's gonna kick ass!
'K.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Dude, we're gonna misspeak English.

====================
I wonder if filling out a form will help anyone now that we're all bio-terrorists?
...Yeah, I'm not a terrorist, dude. I'm a nice guy who needs to see a doctor.
Where is he now?
Anti-smoking people are gonna kill smokers.
...Ow!
I don't think those people are bigots!
I'm just saying that now.  Heyta'clock! Mom and dad are gonna be here to help us!
Does this mean we can't get on the bus?
Catch what?
We've got to get on!
Are you ready, Mom?
What the hell?
Aw, hell!
Heeyy, I don't know!
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
Hey, I love Cartman.
Dude, what the hell?
What?
Kyle, look! It's the band's new self.
They're being profiled on the town's biggest radio.
Look, they're just gonna let us know they're from New York.
Wow, is that from New York?
Look! It's the band's self.
Hey, we're the ones from New York!
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!
Hey, we're from the future, Kenny!
Goddamnit, that's genius!
Whoa, that was from the future!
Butters, you're wearing a bracelet to think that somebody is using your future self to teach us about technology.
You're gonna be in the future, Butters. Just got smarter, and you finally came to understand that being in the future is part of being good at decreasing pain.
Time travel?? Oh my God, they've killed... Brando.
Brando might be smarter than you, but he's not gonna help you be the first person to live.
You're gonna be fine.
Okay, here we go.
You guys, brace yourself. We're gonna go to the mall.
The key to the future, we're gonna build something different.
What the hell would we do again?
Uh that's right. I'm gonna build you a time machine.
Oh no, we're not holing up.
Dude, we've got it.
Towelie sold!
Cartman sold!
Dude, what the hell
====================
I told you that! It's a Hollywood movie?!
They're shooting the news on Saturday!
What?!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
This sucks.
Saturday? Why not just start with the news?
Wow, the trailer for this crap was actually supposed to be over an hour ago.
It's not over.  Saturday is supposed to be Malibu time.
How long before they try to take our son away from us?
I'm not bet on whether or not this movie is good. It's just...  it's not good. It's not good.
Okay.
But Wendy, I don't wanna watch this. I saw the trailer for your movie, and I don't wanna watch it.
What?
I don't know.
Whoa. Dude, you're my best friend, and I don't wanna watch your movie.
Okay.
Fine, Wendy.
I don't know.
Dude, you've got herpes on your face, okay?
Cool!
Hey guys, uh... we had a fight, and he got herpes on your face, too.
That's not true, Mom.  herpes isn't real, actually.
He does it on television, too.
See what?
She's the star of the show.
She doesn't care if we don't watch it.
You watch it?
Yeah, but Mom, the truth is, if we don't go to any shows, Kyle won't ever care about anything.
Hey Wendy, did you bring up the fact that I've been avoiding school? All of a sudden you have to be stressing out people like me that you're just a loser!
Yeah, why do you have to be stressing out?
Well it's not like you're any more talented than Leonardo DiCaprio, it's that you don't have the strength to be president.
You're not bigger than Cartman, of course you're just a year older than Cartman
Okay Wendy, that's not Kyle!
That's not Craig's finger!
That's not the head of Warner Bros.
No, that's the head of Cartman Burger!
Wendy, when is the last time you've seen your friend drunk?
Hey, yeah, and Cartman Burger just opened its mouth and farted blood!
Why are you so into
====================
All rights reserved.
Hey, you guys! What are you doing here?
No, dude, not cool. You've got to be kidding me! I wanna get my friend away from us!
This is just a great idea, dad!
All right, thanks for coming, but we have a question: how come the circus just moved the Independence Square sign to the right?
Can't the white people just keep the traffic coming down the street?
Because we have to. The white people want us to leave some money everywhere else.
Uh, we have to go check on our parents.
Please, we don't wanna see the Vietnam Kids perform here.
Come on, let's go check on our parents.
They seem pretty happy to me.
You know, I think when the Japanese came back and the Americans moved away, they had something to do with the fact that the Vietnam kids were getting closer and closer to extinction.
And that something is genetic diversity.
Yeah, I guess we all are.
Genetic diversity is the study of how and not the development of one's character.
What?
No, he didn't.  Hey, look!
That's not what the photo was about  guy. That's what the coloring said.
It was just a joke. A trick, dude. A "silver bullet" to save the day.
Come on, let's go get the real McCoy!
He just showed up in the movie.
Aw, dude, I should have just told him the secret to the silver bullet.
Yeah, well... I just couldn't stop the car ahead.
Whoa, dude! It's not like the alien guys in Star Trek ever go to extreme measures to make you believe that the world is going their way.
Hey, you guys! Where are you guys going?
Could you just drop this please?
I'm not done with my coloring.
Dude, it's not that big a deal.
Hey, you guys! Where are you guys going?
Whoa, dude! It's not that big a deal.
You all have your own set of coloring books, dude. You don't wanna be home-schooled.
Whoa, dude! How do you guys read?
Dude, everybody is different. I'm not Charlie Brown.
Huh?
Dude, I don't know what
====================
It's time for the big dance.
Do you everyone have your big brown NOOF t-shirt on?
Hey kid, you're gonna have to tell your dad the old adage, "Remember, bring the turds, leave the turds."
Cartman, why are you doing this circus?
They want you back with or without Jimmy.
Dude, this is history.
Whoa, dude!
Timecist?
What?
Craig's being sarcastic.
That's not cool.
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta calm down!
It's all mellow and sweet!
Dude, wha-?!
What?!
Hey, he's just dancing around.
No, he didn't mean it.
Clowndough.
Clowndad, how come you didn't get any stitches, fatass?!
Oh, nice, you're now dead.
That's a nice way to end the show. You two can rest easy, face it. You're just kids, after all.
'Kay, come on guys.  Let's get out of here.
Okay, we made it!
They want to know what you were doing when you shot that guy.
What the hell is going on?
I think so.
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here.
Whoa, dude!
Yeah, dude, it's all stupid.
You guys, we gotta talk about Craig's farts after this one.
Cremated? What are you talking about?
Dude, they're still fresh out of high school. They don't remember how much they drank.
Cremated guys?
Yeah, a bunch of us drank him.
Did you get to any futures?
You're doing it again, dude!
Cremation jokes?
Yeah, that's what I'd call your bloodlust.
Cartman, don't do this!
Run, dude!
Heyina, you're the one who pulled the trigger, remember?
Yeah.
Oh, mellow.  Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Yeah - if you don't quit, then we're no longer friends.
I don't think you Carlyle clone people, just check out Cartman.
Uhm, yeah, I'd like to
====================
It's true, Kyle. We went to see The Passion.
True. They bought it and stored it in a holocrrute.
Because, they lied to us first. The Passion sucked.
I don't believe it.
It was so bad, I didn't like it, I loved it.
I can't believe it.
Oh, shit.
Jesus, what's going on?
I'm not hysterical, I just didn't like it.
I mean, Kyle, listen, I really don't want anybody knowing what I've been through.
God, I'm having second thoughts of never having been this excited about the whole thing.
I'm not hysterical, I just didn't like it.
I don't love The Passion as much as the next guy, but I have a new girlfriend.
What the hell is going on?
...Well, I have a new girlfriend.
She's 25 years old.
I don't get it.
Yeah, that's not bad of a name.
Ms. Crabtree, maybe we should do with it.
What's it say?
Dude, I don't get it.
Come on, let's go see what's on Tweek's mind.
What?
What the hell?
Yeah, let's go see!
Whoa, dude!
It's the music he's playing that makes you wanna hurt Kenny!
How do you know?
Well it's the music he's playing that makes you wanna hurt Kenny!
Dude, do you really you would justistic, asshole?! Have you ever heard of the zodiac sign of a little kid? Wham!
Aaaah!
Signe stupid as well.
Signe, too little baby. Signe is on Tweek's iPod.
He's playing bris and he's thinking he's gonna kill himself.
Kenny's a little older than us, but he's not whammit! Signe is on Tweek's iPod, too.
What??
Oh Jesus Christ.
Kenny's a little older than us, but he's not shoo-ing us!
No, uh, I mean, yeah, we're gonna kill Kenny if we don't get out of there.
Dude, we can't get out of there.
Kenny's a-a-a-aa
====================
I'll write a little note, and then we'll go over what we did.
What the note said, I don't think is it.
Oh, hey Dad. Can I talk to you?
No. Dad, I don't think you should be in a boy's club.
Talk about nothin'.
No?
Dude, what's the matter? Have you got anything against boys and girls being treated like second-class citizens?
Look, you guys, there's nothing wrong with a boy and a girl getting along. But this is obviously not a boy's club and I'd be remiss if I didn't warn you guys of it. The note Kim Richards gave to me said that Kim would be serving as the club's manager for the next few months. And according to the New York Yankees, Kim was actually really unhappy with the way the club was performing at Yankee Stadium. And, so, last night, he wrote a note calling attention to something really serious was about to come. 
"Hey Kim," wrote Kim.
"That's not normal," said Butters.
"Hey, you can't read my note!"
"It's not a big deal," said Butters.
"It's just a stupid list," said Kim.
I'm not getting on, you guys. I wrote it.
"Untitled Club," "Untitled Club." It's not a big deal.
Uhh, excuse me, what's the problem?
What do you mean?
What's up?
Kyle?
Dude, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I have to go to my phone book and take it back.
What the hell is wrong with that?
Dad, I have to go to my phone book and take it home.
No, Dad, I can't!
Jesus Christ, what the hell is going in?!
Mom!
No, dad, I've gotta go to my facebook. I can't take it home with me!
Well what does it say?
On the official Kim Kardashian fan club's official Facebook page.
What the hell is going on?!
Dad, I've gotta go to my phone book and get some sleep.
Goddamnit, what the hell?!
Who?  Oh my God.
Dude, are you thinking how stupid I
====================
She's just pissed off at him.
I don't care, dude! I'll take her to the hospital!
Where?  Ha!
Huh?
But what about her?
But what?
But what?
But what?
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!

But who?
But what?!
But what?!
But what?!
But, but, but, but, but, but, But, how, how tolerant!
So, so much for my sake.  But, but, but who cares?
If you mean just let me go, okay? I'm not a threat anymore!
No! I will stay here. And I'll be here forever.
Shut up, Cartman!
What the hell?
Hey guys.
This is the school, not the town!
Fine! If they have any respect, they're never gonna leave!
Cartman, what the hell happened?
Whoa.
Huh?
Oh, hey guys.
This is the ATF.
Weal it, dude. They need to go check on everybody.
It's all right, dude. It's all right.
Dude, it's ATF.
It's all right, dude. It's all right.
Cartman, you suck.
It's all right, dude. It's all right.
I think Cartman really wants to kill himself.
Dude, this is really ugly.
No, no, this is everything!
I wanna see a ton of pimples on your body!
I wanna see tons of anal and urethral infections!

====================
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but we have an emergency. You two have to get out of here.
Shut up, Cartman!
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
Dude! We just got shot down!
Well, everybody says they get a bear, but what about them?
Well that, that, that, that, that.
Oh, okay, better than us.
Bears, don't bark!
It's up for debate, Cartman. You two want the den?
The governor?
Governor-uh, we think the bear problem is getting worse by the day.
Do you really think we should stay in the state forever, or do we just want a temporary home?
Dude, this is happening to me so. It's like the second-largest movie studio in the country has decided that if we don't get a big movie, they won't keep making films.
We can't go anywhere, you guys. We've got to find a way to get back at this stupid bear.
Mom, I think we're going to sleep now.
Hey, can I come in?
Yeah, shut up, stupid door.
Well bear, I want to talk to you first. Do you- know what we're talking about?
No, bear, I don't think you understand. This isn't about the bear, it's not even about you.  I mean, we all know what happened that day.
I'm not responsible for what my parents went through.
Dude, now I wonder how the hell do we all make food for a bear?
Cartman, don't be such a bear.
"I want to talk to you first."  "I want to talk to you now."
That's it?
Bear cubs don't seem to be too shabby.
Yeah.
Yeah, dude, worth all the money they're gonna get.
Hey yeah!
Dude, what are you going to do to them?
Ploozer thing, ploozer thing.
Yeah.
Hey, I love my mom.
Ploozer thing thing thing.
Yeah, ploozer thing, ploozer thing.
What?
What about the bear?
Ploozer thing, ploozer thing.
What?
Oh, thank God.
====================
We're trying to find the person responsible for killing Kenny!  Maybe this is another trick that your mom or dad is good at, huh?
Did you bring us money?
Yeah, we don't know where Kenny is.
Dude, it's not that big a deal.
Come on, we've gotta hurry and give him back to your mom or dad!
Where did you get the picture?
Oh, hey dad. How come you didn't show us the money?
We have to show the people what their dad did wrong!
He lied to us, Mom!
The person who put the false fire under the bridge!
Shut up!
Come on, we've gotta hurry and give back the coins!
The person who cut off the skin between your legs!
W-we were so worried you might die! You saved our lives, Dad!
Give us the money, Dad!
The one and only Melvyn!
Come on, we've gotta hurry and give back the coins!
Hey Melvyn, what happened?
You don't understand, Dad. You're his grandma!
Dad, why does Obama have to be so nice?
No, he just doesn't understand.
Well, we got a cool new girlfriend, too!
Hey, hey dude. How come you didn't show us the green door?
Man, it's so cool!
Ehhh.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Ehhh.  Ehhh.  Ehhh.
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.
You mean the thing in Blackmagic?
Dude, the photo?
Don't worry. We have something in here.
What is it, dude?
We have to get it to them first.
Come on, Kyle!
They want it to be safe for all to see.
...Ow!
Come on, dude, we have to wait for the bus.  Wow, this is pretty cool.
We're going fast!
Wow, this is pretty cool!
We're in big on that!
We're gonna hold it in this little kid's hand forever.
You mean, the thing in Blackmagic?
Tweek?
Alright, let's get back in the car.
Here, Dad, we need to talk.
What grade are you going
====================
Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like Kyle's got it out for us.
Yeahhhh! Who cares? Let's nail this!
Hi, uh this is Kyle. We see him about once a month.
He looks pretty happy to me.
Yeah, but, you know?  Hey Wendy!  You're a big fatass, you're just exaggerating.
Yeah, but, it was the flu. And now he's like a year old, huh? I don't know what to do about it.
I guess... I guess we can't get anymore geeky than that.
Huh?
Yeah, that's not cool. Don't cry for Jay.
That's fake.
That's what I get about "the farts are worth it."
Ms. Jefferson, I do not buy it. You're wasting your time.
What is that?
Oh Jesus!
I don't get it. You're so into it, Ms. Jefferson.
Oh I'm sorry I didn't understand.
Yeah, well, so is your family.
I don't know, you guys. They're all messed up.  Is your family in there?
It's just a little messy.
Oh my God. Did you get to any dirty parts?
I don't get it, you're such a grandpa.
No dude, you're a great-grandpa.
Great-grandpa being Grandpa.
Bu-but I don't take kindly to that trick.
Uh, grandma, I just don't take it kindly to it.
Yes, I take it back.
You're not grandpa, you're a piece of shit
What cuz' we were messing around...  You're not Steve Buscemi's best friend, you're his best friend
No dude, you're not Marvin Gay, you're his best friend
No, but...
Aww... I don't take Um, bribes!
For what?
No, dude, I'm not taking any of that stuff.
...So you're not gonna tell on me, Grandpa?
Fine, dude!
I don't take any... bribes!
Don't take these guys's sh-aughs about me!
Yeah, well, so is your family.
You take a look at the schedule, asshole! They're
====================
Bu-newark, I need to talk to you real quick.
No no, I'm not playing games anymore. I've been told to call my dad.
What?!
I already tried!
No, dad, I just- got sucked into a stupid game now!
You've tried!
Butters, what the hell is going in?
Whoa. Dude, no! She's not my girlfriend.
Butters, we've been getting messages from all over the world calling and saying we're hopelessly lost and, you stupid asshole!
Hey what are you doing, bottlenecracker?
Yeah, get with the times, dude.
Did you bring us?
What?
Who?
So?
Kenny? You've been kicked out of school.
Do you still want to go to school?
...What?
Goddamnit, that's football.
Is that ball? Is that ball?
Cartman, is there ever a bleachers of Ann Arbor?
Oh, hey, Cartman.
What is that big Detroit team doing?
Uhhh,where is he going?
When is that going to be so sweet, huh Kenny?
Oh, sweet! You said you'd give us a kiss.
Oh, good! We're getting that Michigan guy for Loogie.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No, dude. We lost one-fourth of the original tape.
Really?
...What?
Yeah, dude, that's like that stupid movie, Aliens.
Yeah, dude, that's like the fifth book in the Bible.
We don't wanna read something that's been around for five years and can't remember a single thing about it.
Beside, it's like the side quests in the movie make you think about how bad everything was, how little things are, and how bad everything is now, so think about that.
What was the first thing you did?
Yeah, there was something new to do.
What did you do?
Look, you guys, we're all busy. We don't have time for this much shopping spree.
Oh no, dude, there's a bunch of tickets we forgot to give Phil away for.
And there's a bunch of tickets you didn't want to give Phil away for fear that he'd turn into a gay
====================
Dude, I can't believe that fat ass! He's gone, now what could we do for a big idea?
What do we mean? Dude, we can't believe that fat ass!
I'll vote! I just got busted!
What the hell is his idea?
Vote or Die?
Okay, I'll vote.
The jail door is against the sign.
I'm sure they'll find us a way out!
It's against the law to search in a park - is it against the law to search in a park to vote?
Kenny says that before we go.
Aunt Flo, about to issue her fifth-fattening diamond to the kangaroos?
Would you just relax and let us deal with this out of the window?
Well, of course! It's all right, as long as we don't break it.
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
Why did Towelie go to such great lengths to make sure I got what I wanted? There's nothing but bad w-ware!
That's a lady's business?
Well, we're not keeping it secret, you stupid Britney! We're--
Oh my God!  We've got a man who tastes like garbage!
He's a douchebag!
Hey yeah!  A little too douchebagty.
Come on, Britney, let's go!
Oh, sorry. I thought you were busy being Mr. Garrison's pet.
What?
Shut up, Cartman!
Towelie!
Yeah, when does that get to be?
You right that! That's when I realized I had it!
We don't have any other choice! We've just gotta go see the fireworks.
They've gone.
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
Thanks for everything, Towelie.
Oh my God. They've killed Kenny!
Come on, where are they?
Where's the Uncle Jimbo and the Uncle George?
I don't know.
Mom, Dad, the best friend aah can get.
Cartman!
Whoa, dude!
Hey you guys! You guys! We gotta get Towelie out of school
====================
I had no idea this book was just getting good!
Wow! Thanks, Dr. Mephesto!
Wow!
Where'd you get that pink scarf?
That thing about the red stabbing pain? I thought you were Pixie Hollow.
No, dude! Those aren't real flowers.
Pigments!
Yeah, let me get this straight: I don't think I've ever been this sick over the last couple of days.
Where's your flare?
Yeah, let me see. Where's your ladybug sting?
His? That's them. They said we had a lisp outage.
What's so funny about that?
Yeah, but they said we could get a whale to fly us to Peru.
We could make a stupid boat guessable using symbols.
Uh, we think we're from Peru.
I think we're good friends?
What's all gone?
No...
I don't know.
Agh, I gotta go to the movies.
I'm not drunk, Dad. I'm pretty sure this is a smart idea.
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
...Do you have a way to get back at Cartman for this, Uncle Jimbo?
Stop it, Jimbo!
Cartman, you can't go to the movies with those Native Americans!
No, you can't even go on the sledding course!
Don't you see, Mom? If we go on the ice, we're gonna lose to those Indians.
We're gonna lose to those Indians first.
No, no, Mom, we don't wanna go on the sledding course.
What?
Yeah, me and Mom are gonna play puck hockey.
You don't understand, Uncle Jimbo. You don't even know what you're debating about!
Mom, are you and Dad having a nice time?
Ahee ha, ahang on, my good man?
What?!
Dad, are you and Dad having a nice time?!
Nooo-ho!
Yeah, me and Mom are gonna play puck hockey. Come on, you guys!
Not now, you guys. We were gonna order Ned Flanders' Ned Flanders Hockey Stick for you!
What are you going to do, Ned?
Whoa!
What?
Hey, what's up?
...Yeah?
Dude, it looks
====================
You can't be serious! I think we'd better get to the bottom of this.
We get it from here. The Antichrist is back in our time plane!
Oh yeah? I can get to the roof! Right over town!
No, dude!  You have to get us there!
No, this really sucks!
And this really sucks.
So what should we do? We can't let that Japanese guy get near us, so we kinda have to go.
Or else...
We can't do anything.
Cartman?
Hey Mom, how come you never told him about Cartman?
Yeah, the first day is so miserable. It's like they think it's all they cares about.
Things that matter, like the guinea pig... But that's... that doesn't make it any less miserable.
What are you talking about?
That pig has tons of cancer, and doctors are trying all over the world to save it.
Help your team-mate get back up, Mom.
Yeah, that's okay, too, Cartman.
But what about her?
...Because I just gave him the money for Christmas.
You don't give a crap about Christmas, Kyle!
You have to be kidding, Kyle!
Presents...?
Presents!
What are you talking about?
That's amazing, Mom.
No, they don't have presents for Christmas.
No, they don't have presents for laughter.
Presents for one another?
Kyle, you have to be laughing so loud that you lose your balance.
You've had too much of Comedy Central, and you just lost it.
Comedy Central just killed itself.
It's great to have you back, Butters, it's great to have you back, Patton Oswalt.
Oh, hey, doesn't seem to be a very safe time for riders.
Hey, it's these ninjas.
Well, we've gotta get 'em back.
Yeah, we've gotta get 'em back.
I don't know.
Come on, we gotta get 'em back.
They're after you, Butters. Right over your head!
Hurry.
Wait! Juggernaut is!
He's the Super Best Friends!
Yeah, right! They're after you too, Butters.
Hundred-e
====================
Because it isn't fair!
Because it isn't fair that one day I'm forced to join the Super Adventure Club, and the next day I'm denied my dream!
No, you can't read this! Adventure is all but over!
Dad, how are you going to raise your family?
What?
Yeah, give me a heart attack.
Yeah, give me a broken leg.
He's counting on you.
What?
That's impossible.  You don't work at the Super Adventure Club, you just opened it up and it's all gold and glory!
I don't believe it.
No, you don't even know what you're talking about!
Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
Kyle, you have to come with us.
It's the leader of the Super Adventure Club, Kyle!
No, I'm not talking about... Barbrady!
Yeah, dude, fatass, you're on my team.
I'm on your team.
I'm on your team.
I'm on your team.
I'm on your team.
I'm on your team.
AAAAAAA!
Television?
Television?
Dude, we can't watch it. We have to act like it's this golden age of TV.
Oh no, maybe this is the time.
Wow, there's a lot of peoplerage going on right now. I guess I've learned to live with it.
What is it, Chef?
Why?
Butters, don't be such a gayer.
Well, I guess so. At least I'm not gonna die from it like you might.
Hey you guys.  Everyone's watching Timmy from the toilet. Why don't you take Chef's place?
Chef, are you having a bowel control operation?
Well then you can't work from OK to OK.
Fine, you can't work from OK to okay.
Well then how come you can't work from OK to OK?
Fine, Chef.
What?
Stop screwing around, dude. We've got a lot to do.
Yeah dude, that's not cool.
Cartman, where are you going?
Why are you so into it, dude? That you wanna be on TV?
Yeah, why don't you just go to the movies?
You
====================
Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman, you can't read this!
He is reading the New Yorker!
What?
So?
Dude, the author is right!
Ogh..!
Yeah, right.
Look, Pip, the author is right. The point is that you all make a terrible husband or a terrible father, and you all need to start giving other couples counseling.
Well, first of all, it's not that big a deal.
I don't believe it.
What are you guys doing, Cartman?
They're not so bad, Kyle.
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison, but, having served our country we- we are people like you who need to be treated differently from everyone else. We're not super-cool, funny, and kind, and uh-
God, shut up, Cartman.
Hey, don't be such a pussy, Cartman.
It's not that bad, dude.
Kyle, it's just a big fat red flag.
Kyle, it's a sign.
I've been banned from Facebook.
What the hell are they doing this week?
What?
Oh I'm watching a movie.
Mom, I'm so sick of hearing this stuff. My friends are dying, and I don't have any money.
Dude, this is not replayed.
I don't want to watch this stupid movie any more.
Mom, you can't watch this stupid movie! You guys are gonna get arrested for buying crack.
Get the fuck out of here!
Yeah, like we were gonna do.
Why did the asshole wearing the wrong color get the pink star?
Hey, how about this?
He's a bris, and we're gonna take his Purple Heart.
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. Here, give me the pink star.
Whoa, dude, you guys want to charge us? I took the pink star?
Hey, I took the pink star?
What is that?
The captain? All of Germany?
Damn, dude. Give me the pink star.
What?
The captain? All of Germany?
What?
Europa? Oh, he's not our captain.
Oh, he's justzin. He was the one who told us the war was over.
No, he didn't.

====================
There is a dresser drawer full of Chinese dolls.
Dude, who the hell are these?!  Hwa?
On our way to work?
We gotta help them.
Help them get rid of these dolls.
Help them get rid of this Margaritaville.
Hey, can we please just let them go? It's her, okay?
Cartman, you have to keep going. It's her. Don't stop.
Look, maybe, maybe, maybe we can get around this.
Let's just try it again.  And here's why we think this is a great idea:
She's not scared of dolls!
Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4.
What?
Dude, you can't just take all my stuff.
Well, we'll see what the doctor wants. Come on, guys.
Okay, so um, see you tomorrow, Bob Saget.
No, we'll see if he's okay.
Hey, he- is he a-gh?
Yeah, binoculars.
See? That's nice.
Dude, we gotta take a picture of him.
Oh, hey dude. Saget, how's he doing?
Yeah, binoculars.
Sgt. Wright was really pissed off and wanted pictures of all the guys who play dodgeball. So, we just- got a while to go.
Oh, hey guys. How are you feeling?
Uh, I'm just a minute.
Wow, you guys really love animals.
Is this a bad time for you?
We've got a big problem. Cartman caught some guys before the A&E was able to take him to the sea, but he's never seen anything really bad.
Hey, that's Cartman!
Kenny's sorry, dude, he didn'thin'.
Dude, it's not that big a deal.
What?
Yeah, he is.
Dude, no way!
What?
Yeah, they've done it before, Kenny!
Dude, we're trying to save somebody!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Maybe there's something to this.
Kenny's soul is now floating around somewhere, and we only got it because we didn'thin'.
...Save us?
No.
But maybe there
====================
By now you all know that I have a video of Kyle's dad getting duct-taped to a wall. Now, I know that you think he must be really pissed off at me, but, I can't prove it.
I'm not jealous, Kyle. I've got some stuff to tell you.
Yeah, back in that room.
No, listen to me. The only way I can get Kyle out of here is if we get into a fight, or if you all keep getting duct-taped to me, then I'll kill you.
Cartman?
Hey look, Kyle. The world is finally back to normal.
Oh no, dude, this guy wants to see how badly you'd like to have Kyle duct-tape you.
Pretty good. We're almost done.
Vs. Gecko.
Well, not yet. I need your ideas, see?
Let's do this, let's see if you can get Cartman's tape, please.
What?
Dude, this is stupid.
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
I don't know! All I know is...
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What?!
Hey, what are you doing?
Yeah, I wonder why Cartman's tape isn't back in your possession.
Uh, we've got to record this. It shows what Kenny did to himself while he was in the hospital.
Yeah, right.
Cartman?!
Yeah, when does the gonna become a person?
We have to protect it!  All we have to do is go see Token, then tell him what we know.
See what?
Got it.
Token, then we'll go tell him what to get us out of here.
Whoa, you guys!
Huh?
Token, I'm sorry. I had um yesterday coming over.
I don't know.
Fine, then come on over here and break the glass over here window.
I just feel I need to use your little brother as a guinea pig.
Uh, excuse me. Token, do you know how to do that?
Cartman, why are you doing this?
No, I just was because I love my brother.
HeARGH!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Where are they gonna get us?
I don't know.
====================
Oh, brother! You're not gonna believe this: there's tons of stuff against us!
Yeah! That's true. But is it?
Dude, this is stupid.
What?
Can you tell us how many times you've been to Somalia?
This is our obligation. We have to go get it.
The government is responsible for all this.  We have to go and demand answers.
We came to reclaim the Nelson Centipede from the musical.
You want to help?
We have to.
The musical is terrible. It's weekend and we only have music for guys to play.
We just need some music to sing and then we stretch.
Yeah, why don't you guys just keep going and see what happens?
Then stop!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Then we have to find that music course!
You guys, are we gonna be able to play those songs for sale on the Internet?
Yeah, that would be so cool.
You guys, we need like, 20,000 bids for our monthly allowance.
Choirs are just for kids. You tell 'em they'll love us.
That's right. We've gotta split up and find better jobs.
Commercial? Oh no!
What?
Commercial? Oh my God!
This is not a singing competition.
This is a contest for the monthly allowance of the singer and dancers. The songwriters will be notified first.
We want a guy that sings and performs for thousands of dollars and gets paid less than the dancers.
We want a Foley who releases the world's biggest hit.
Dammit, does anybody know what a commercial is?
No way!
Me neither. I've never heard of anything that like it!
You guys, is it possible for two people to sound the same on the same record?
Your just offending people with that term now?
Well, suppose the record company found out who me and Kenny were singing me at a dance, and said, "Hey, you're going to love us if you don't confess to everybody you know."
Ugh.
No, it's not. I confess to Kenny.
Uhhh,huh.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm sorry guys. I've got it.
Oh, Jesus Christ...
Tweek?
How do we know
====================
I've been told there's gonna be a big fight in the clubhouse, and after that, the big dance is gonna be.
Mom, will you put on the Nike shorts?
That's right. Kenny says if we give in to the outside world, then we'reldeorens can be beetles.
Yeah, they're pretty scary.
Mom, I'm not taking a sis that big.
All right, guys, want to know why the two-way legend has a eight-inch chest?
Cartman, you guys!
It's because you were sent here to fight in the Iraq War.
Yeah, you were awesome, Kyle.  And now, do you still want the Iraq War to begin with?
You were great, Kyle, just like the way it started. Just, like the way it started.
All right, come on guys, we have to go see the Super Best Friends.
Hey, can you just tell us why the two-way legend has a eight-inch chest?
Where were you guys going?
Dude, we gotta go to the mall.
Super best friends? What's the Super-Best Friends thing going on?
Well, we can't go cheap on drugs or whatever it is.  The mall cops are gonna kill us.
Yeah, tell us down under.
Yeah, and they've been getting really hardcore for the past three weeks.
We heard that the Super-Best Friends are gonna come out of the woodchins they perform in.
Bitch.
I guess, just because we rip on your store manager for being so nice to me doesn't mean I don't like you anymore.
You a bitch?
Well, I'm not going back in at your store, Kyle. I'm just gonna have to deal with the outside world.
All right, so let's get started on this.  The whole town is pissed off at us, and they want us to give them our money.
Well, there's the one person in particular we just shamed away from home. Sherlock.
Yeah, he was the best friend we ever gave.
You give him back what no-one else can get?
Oh, God.  Is he going to attack us again?
He could do it all: 1) using our friend as a weapon to get their game plan together 2) or 3) using our
====================
Oh, he's got it.
That's not a pencil I ever took! That's a pencil I lost and came back with--"
Oh, crap!  Oh, crap!
Mom! Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
Come on, Dad, we're going to Kindergarten Pooh's!
Kiddie, you have to keep playing, or else the teacher will find out.
Come on, what's the matter?
Kiddie, you can't keep playing.
Kiddie, we have to stop.
What?
Kenny!  Oh, he's right.
And it's really, really sad.
That's not true!
Kenny, I saw your Facebook page, and saw that you were really popular with kids.
What, dude? Not many people read the New Yorker.
You should read the history of the magazine.
No, no, you don't!
Genre-obsessed people are going around trying to read America's magazine and find out where it says it's based!
Ohhh, fuck.
Oh Jesus, how Vietnam has killed people!
Yeah, what's it say?
Oh, well. Maybe you should go check it out.
Cartman, don't look at the messages on the wall.
What the hell is going on?
Dear Mr. Garrison, Can I ask a question?
What do you think is wrong with the world?
Do you think there's any possible solution?
There could be something that can be done, but it could also be condemned.
There's something that you think we can all agree on: we all want a better world.
There's something that you both want removed from the Internet, but need to be removed from the kids' lives, please?
This is obviously hard for you to handle, dude.
Kenny, you have to do it!
Please, please let the kids decide what they do on the Internet.
What?
This is just a great idea, think about it. Could you just tell us how you guys plan to pay our producer to put up the banner at school?
Well, suppose we raise the question, and he says the school principal, who wants to make sure that our guy can't get in, says they're gonna charge somebody else to put up the banner.
Hey, wait, they
====================
What?
It's a trick I did a long time ago.
Oh wow, I guess you're gonna be okay, Mr. Garrison.
But you're a big fatass, dude, and my parents are gonna be assholes like you
I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
Yeah, like, 2010.
What? What do you mean?
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Man, it sucks that we only have two weeks until baseball season starts.
What are you talking about?
We have to start playing first.
Then I'm not gonna have a chance to practice.
All right, fine, Rays. If we keep going, you guys might as well start playing ball.
Oh, hi, we're you guys. We're here to help Kenny with his ginger haircut. Kenny's not havin it.
Yeah, it's all right.
How come they have ginger hair?
Oh, it's just a little messy.
Oh, yeah, we can't tell you where it is.
What are you guys doing, guys?
Dude, we gotta get to the mall.
All right, this is it.
Oh, hey guys. How's it going?
Yeah, huh, I guess we'll be back for the video games.
Remember, Cartman? We got you back for being a dick.
Yeah, so now you're a dick, too.
What?
Oh, Goddammit!
We've gotta get to the mall early!
Hey, can I join in?
Yeah, it'll be so.
Mom, Dad, how come there's no autograph?
Hey, can I join in?
Goddammit, can I join in?
Aw, I think they're all messed up.  Could we last us for one more day?
Alas, not yet.  Gingers are gonna get us all busted.
Hey, hey, you guys. Did you bring us anything back from the past?
Ah, no thanks, I'm gonna take this stupid stick home.
Where have you guys been?
Uh oh, there's a police car behind us.
Mom, can I join in?
Why don't you just tell the kids to get the video moving again?
That's what I say.
Just let
====================
Well, it's not like I didn't post there; Mr. Garrison just had some really big projects in store.
Yeah, stop it, Cartman! You can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. Some douchey psychic said that a Vietnamese prostitute has a forty dollar credit card number.
You see, Cartman? I know all about Motivation Corp. You see, I know a lot of you are guys and I've been told a lot of things about Vietnamese women before, but, I just couldn't find anything about Motivation Corp.
motivation@normcore.com
No.
To quit.
Yeah, I know.
"quit." That's so gross.
You quit?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Dude, what's the matter?
...Then you have to get out of Vietnam.
I don't know, dude. I'm sorry I went through all that trouble, and I'm gonna go back to the States and get it done.
You sure?
You're gonna return home, Dad.
Yeah. And you said you'd be back in Los Angeles in about 20 hours.
Dude, what happened?
Oh, brother.
You're a big fatass, Dad.
All right, I'm sure.
What?
You guys, I have to go to the principal's office.
Sup?
Where's we supposed to go?
Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
...Dude, you really have to go to the principal's office to find out what went in and who didn't.
Let me see your iPad, Mr. Mackey.
What?
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
I do.
We're doing this.
You follow the instructions we set out for you to follow.
The last thing we want is for you to lose your job and find a new one, period.
Oh shit.
...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
But why?
We don't understand how that-
Dude, you've lost it.
Wait! Stop! What is that?
Oh, no! That's not the sound you're looking for!
What do you mean?
We have to find out where that koo-lug is.
====================
Oh, thank God!
Dad! You're a piece of shit, Dad!
Because I'm videotaping you!
Because I need to know if you and your dad got back together they'd bankrupt the whole town!
And a, aon, that's when I learned it's okay to pee in the middle of the road!
Uh, excuse me, what's going on?
What?!
Mom, urumant!
Excuse me, uhuse me, uhuse me, uhuse me!
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside, to have the N word describe them on the inside but be able to describe them on the outside?
What?
Dad, uh-end of the road, that's just the way it is.
Come on, we've gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
We can't go anywhere, that means we have to get back at the stupid policemen!
What is going on?
...Well, I'm not gonna have a nice life, so I go about my day like nothing has happened.  Packs, DVDs, iPhones, iPods, Blogs.
Oh yeah, all the guys were kinda pissed off at me, and I went and got a bunch of them.
Yeah, I wonder why that guy is performing mummies.
So, what are you and Dad going to do now that that mummified dude has died?
You don't ever catch me saying that, Kyle!
God-damnit, is it ever okay to pee in the middle of the road?
This is the same old shit we were talking about!
"Where's my cell? Don't worry about it!"
"You mean, the ones you killed last?
Aren't you and Kyle's cell numbers now?
Tell me what you guys mean.
So what are you going to do now they're no longer able to help us?
They're trying to reach you and then shooting yourself in the head?
You know, I've done a really good job at it, but there's something else going on.  Something that I want to know right now.
Uh, we're not sure what to do, but think it's one of us that killed the other.
Cartman, if you have any more questions, ask me them here.
I have a
====================
I think it's time we did something a little different.
Yeah, let's dig 'em up.
Stop!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Could you dig 'em up and put them up for sale?
What?
I don't believe it.
No, no, they're not good.  Look! There they are!
Dad, these are awesome!
Dude, these are rad!
Rad?
Comrade, do you really you have to work so hard to get these rams?
These are rock stars!
Wow, these are rock stars!
Wow! Rock star!
Ms. Spears, how come these rams are making love to us on TV?
Calm down, Spears fan, we're not doing the bidding of the filmmakers anymore.
Sure, dude, we'll do our job.
Okay, we will!
That's hopeless! Everyone in the country wants to make love to this rock star, but the producers hate us and want us to change the show.
Uh, we'd love to perform at his house, but we have an obligation to do so we both get in trouble, and you get to go.
Are you sure?
Damn, dude. The heat of the moment is never leaving my dad's room.
Nooo!
Come on, Spears fan, we've gotta hurry.
Okay, the time has finally come.
What the hell is he gonna do to us?!
He's all ears, just listen to that!
Oh Jesus, there's another guy!  Hey!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle, what are you doing?
Aw, crap.
Dude, I'm not playing.
Hay, you're not playing.
Why the hell not?! That's stupid, you're playing a stupid role.
Let's just keep playing and getting higher and higher.
What role?
Hurry! Go!
All right, let's do this!
Yeah, let's see if anybody has even shown up yet.
Nnnaaargh!  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle!
Kyle, don't!
Get the hell out of here!
You can't see anything; just keep going.
Look at what's been happening!
Yeah
====================
Yeah.
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little bunny?
Dude, the two male judges love her.
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us.
You're not alone.
If that's the case, then congratulations, you two contestants! You're the judges, and if you can get the two judges to let us vote for one another, then we're all gonna go there!  Okay, that's a enough thing to go ahead!
Ok, I'll vote.
I don't care. I'm gonna just do the voting for now.
Okay.
What?
Dude, what happened?
What's that?
What??
Oh, what's the one-u-no?
No, no, I'm voting.
I was thinking about making a movie, so I-
Oh, crap!
Boy, this is the dumbest thing I've heard!
Vote again, stupid lad!
Oh, crap!  Boy, this is the stupidest thing I've heard!
What?
Yeah, how do you make eggs?
But, what should I do with all the gold?
Hello?
With all due respect to Ms. Claridge, I have to say that I have no idea. I love her and she's a sweet person.
I don't think she adds up, either.
I wish Ms. Claridge had told me this whole time ago that I should.
Oh, brother.
Don't be such a friend, Claridge. This whole time, we've been getting each other's backs.  In fact, I once took Thomas Jefferson's advice and went to Germany to fight for Germany.
No, no, don't make me go to war.
Napalm!
No, that's not gonna work.
With America fighting for their lives and Europe trying to outsmart America by building airports, then that's what we're gonna do.
Yeah, we should all go there. All right?
What, you mean, the Star Spangled Banner?
Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks.
I think we're at the C-47. That should be enough to put us in touch with the outside world.
There, at last!

====================
Kyle, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have a question for you.
What dish would you suggest?
Tofu and bean soup.
Then I'll see if you're into animals' love, or just desserts.
Thanks a lot, Wendy!
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have a question for you.
What dish would you suggest?
Tofu
I'm sure they'll all like well it's just desserts.
I like it.
I don't wanna s'more.
No, it's not that.  Oh thank God.
Ugh, you guys, are we still in the game?
Dude, we never thought you were so cool.
Oh yeah, of course! Now come on!
You guys! GameOver!
Dad??
Oh God-damnit!
What are you doing?
Oh Jesus, did you see what Kyle did to Kyle.
No!
What happened?
...Yeah, we can't let them do that.
Go on, dude it's the rules!
Dude, we have to be more sophisticated about how we lobby. Show us how you lobby!
Uh, if we win a theme park theme park entrance, then we can go to the next level!
Oh right.
And we can't get a new locker here, so we can't play.
Guys, guys, guys, stop!
Yeah, well, so is the parking lot.
Well, Cartman, when a kid builds a fire, he usually follows it up with some symbolic letter.
What's "They're not coming", you guys?
Well, I guess I have to keep working at it.
I wonder if... we were supposed to take Kyle to the mall, but... not yet.
Yeah, when was the last time you've ever seen Tony Danza?
Come on, dude, we have to do this!
I don't think we're in America anymore, dude.
Towelie!
Yeah, who cares?
Come on, dude, we have to do this!
This is ridiculous, dude!
Dude, this is ridiculous.
This is ridiculous. We're making fun of somebody's ... body.
Well, we need some body parts, dude.
Dude, just hurry.
Ow!
Yeah, hurry. 
====================
Dude, you must be pissed off!  Everyone hates you.
You have to be angry with everybody; it's all just a big stupid misunderstanding. Mr. Garrison said that XBox people play video games to play on the computer.
He's just saying that some people use a stick for control.
Yeah, that's better.
Okay, I need to go to the video store.
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have to hurry and get our money back.
Yeah, just so you see, you've got a bunch of XBox people fighting.
Yeah, what a coincidence.
Alright, let's go.
You're almost there, dude.
Mom, Dad, are you all right?
Yeah, who cares?
Come on, let's go.
Oh, nice going, you assholes! Now what are you going to do for XBox?
Wow, that's a sweet idea!
Butters, listen. The world is changing. People are going to be able to buy games on their XBoxes and play them on the real thing. What's the point of having all the dumb douchebags in the world telling us what to do?
Well, join us. We're gonna bring the crazy crowds back to Woodstock, New York.
What?
Come on, we have to make sweet love to the superintendents.
Yeah,assimilians.
Oh my God.
Nah, we wanna do a comedy-rap album.
We'll see you later, Chef.
You do?
Hey,boy, we've been getting your attention these past couple of days.
Yhh, excuse me. What's the problem?
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
What's the problem?
Oh, boy. Why?
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love each other anymore?
That's not true, dude. Is what they say?
Dude, you're not supposed to comment on stuff like that.
What the hell is going on?
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
What the hell is going on?
Ah, I think we're in trouble.
...Blog?
...Blog?
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!  Hey Mom, how come we have to write a note to you!
We're writing a
====================
You need to be home-schooled, Chef.
See, Kyle? They're supposed to be this way in Grandpa's and Grandpa's kids' libraries.
But why? Why would you use a curse word on someone who's not their own?
...I don't get it.
Mom, I don't get it.
Whee!
You guys, I don't get it. Why would anyone else do the talking? I voted for Obama last night.
All right, I guess we can at least see the debate as if it were some far-off future.
What was the-
But, hey, I didn't mean to-
That's McCarthyism!
Wh-why?
But if I were you I'd know better than to try to reason with you.
It's just a show about religion, dude! We're not supposed to give a crap about anything!
Who's Captain America?
Cool. I thought Mr. Garrison was Captain America.
What's up?!  Oh yeah.
Doctor Pond is right. I think America first. Anyway, the first thing I want to do is get Mr. Garrison's attention.
What do I have to do?
I have to do what I wanna do.
I'll do anything.
Doctor Pond?
What the hell is going on?
...What?
It's supposed to be a football.
And it's not a commercial?
It wasn't a commercial, duh! It was a secret!
You guys, we need a place to go for a long weekend!
Goddammit, Cartman, we don't wanna talk about things, you know!
Yeah, but then why do we even wanna talk about them?!
W-we only have art so far.
Hey, hey, what are you guys doing?
Yeah, what a dumbass.
We've come to reclaim the prize for Loogie!
Well, we didn't, dude. We didn't even-"got the memo" written all over it!
W-we're trying to be the first guy to take the trophy to the highest office in the land.
Cartman, we have to remember that Loogie got the memo and we're the first ones to be selected for the bullcrap bullcrap bullcrap!
Yeah,  you know, Loogie, ahem
====================
Kyle? Kyle?! Hiya.
I'm Adams, this is Kyle.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle!
They did?  Kyle!
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Oh Jesus, can you hear me out?
Kyle, you can't, you can't even try to stop the truck from coming at you.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, he's still alive. Maybe there's a way out.
But for what?
...Well, first we have to find out exactly what kind of gay club a black person is and how he's being treated.
Hey, how's it going?
That sucks, dude.
Dude, I hate Scott Malkinson.
How's he doing?
How's it goin', fat ass?
Oh yeah, we have to cancel our show right now.
It was cancelled.
We were so hoping we could use this money to buy boats.
You do?
Why don't you just go home?
Excuse me?
We have to go to the Middle East now.
Oh no!
Dude, are we supposed to go back in the wrong boat?
Ah, well, we can't just let someone else do it.
Kyle, enough! They've been caught!
They've been sent to where the pirates are.
Look, we just want you to do the right thing and get back at the Blackwater!
Yeah, dude, we'll do the same!
What are you going to do?
Aw, crap.
Dude, we just wanted your help!
Awww!
What happened?
Kyle, no! You can't just leave me here alone.
Heyios, you've gotta go to the big fishide guy or else we'll all get busted!
What?
Kyle, this is dumb.
Two hundred dollars?
Well, why don't you just take the sting out of those cows?
Dude, we just can't seem to get Kyle to stop throwing up.
Naw, it's not that bad.
AY, come on!
yield yay!
OK, Sso, this is gonna be one of those big family gatherings.
Parents, come over and tell us what we want for Christmas dinner.
What?
No, this is so ridiculous!

====================
A mile away, in the town of Saguenay.
We went to the movies. This is the movie they all want to you to see.
It's perfect. Cartman is an asshole.
Come on, Kyle. Let's get went!
Come on, everyone!  This is the movie they all want to see!
Yeah!
Where'd you get a cow with a cow on its back?
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
They wanna kill you too, Cartman!
Where?
But I don't understand why we can't have babies.
Yes, but... But I don't understand why you can just have people believe something you don't even believe.
You're such a douchebag
Yeah, you're a douchebag too, Kyle.
How can you say that kind of stuff about people you don't know?
It's true, dude. I've known a lot of douchebags for like five years. They've all been lying to me like, "Don't you see what's happening out there?" Have you ever heard of 'em?
Look, they use the N word.
Dude, they're everywhere.
Well, they don't matter. There's nothing special about you. I mean, you're 10 years old, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
You're wasting your time, Cartman. Now think about it this way: If a bunch of ugly kids in a kid's school showed up in a bunch of places they've never seen before, they'd probably be pissed off at each other. They'd just as soon throw rocks at each other.
Kyle, maybe you should go check on them.
Come on, you guys. We might be at the bottom of the mountain. If those kids get us, maybe they'll start thinking about getting back at you.
Come on, dude, you've gotta get home and get some sleep.
Dude!
Alright, guys, here we go.  We've gotta figure out a way to get this thing back up.
You guys, I think this is hopeless.
Hey, yeah!  It's too quiet in here.  It's too quiet in here.  It's too quiet in here.
Hey, hey guys. The bell rang. What are you guys doing?
We got you back, Kyle. We got you
====================
No, no, we're not playing it. Pff!
I don't wanna be in a stupid homosexual's wedding!
Oh, brother! I'm a gay Christian guy!
What's the big deal? Can't we just be quiet?
Hey, can we just be quiet about these things?
Ah, excuse me, who is Ms. Claridge?
Oh, nice going, Mr. Garrison. But you guys are still undercover agents for the government. Can I speak with Ms. Claridge now?
Uh, I don't wanna talk about that stupid homosexual, but I have to tell you, it's worse than your imaginary friend.
I just want you to be rid of that pig, okay? Alright, just leave me alone.
Okay, let's get back to the room.
Oh, no!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Excuse me, can I speak with Ms. Claridge now?
Yeah, that'd be sweet.
Uh, I don't wanna talk about that imaginary friend, but, it's worse than that.
What do you mean?
Alright, let's get back to the room.
It's just a matter of getting Ms. Claridge to stop ripping on other people for fantasy, because I'm just a- different gender.
I don't wanna talk about that imaginary friend, but-
Look, I really don't care about what your parents think! I'm just trying to get my parents to do something!
Dude, I don't know about you but, if I see you at a gay club, I'll probably try to get my parents to do something.
Yeah, well, so is your imaginary friend.
Well, so is your parents.
I don't know, you dude! I mean, isn't that what you say, too?
...Really?
Dude, that's not funny.
What?
Because I told you, dude! I'm not gonna make it in time for the football game, so just... hang in there.
Shut up, Cartman!
Come on, Kenny, he's gotta start going.
What?
Yeah, dude, that's not funny!
Dude, what are you doing?
What?!
Dude, you shouldn't be having such a big party!
Oh, no!
It's onlyin'.

====================
I don't know where we're gonna get our money, Grandpa!
Give me our money, Grandpa!
Give me our money, Grandpa!
Give me our money, Grandpa!
No, dad! Give me our money!
Help me!  They've been transferred to another town. Maybe it's too late.
Oh my God.  Sir,,, Grandpa-
Cartman!
No, dad! No, Grandpa-
Just, leave me alone!
Why do I have to go to the next town?
Well, I guess we can't just let somebody else do it for us.
Ahhh, more guns?
More guns?
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh my God.
Kyle, do you really we want more guns?
Cartman, just keep quiet. All this talk of 'imdingleship' is just the beginning of things.
He's just been sucked into a whole new ball game.
I don't get it.
I don't understand, Dad.
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone have any ideas?
Hello?
Hey Kyle.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, maybe, just maybe, there's something to be learned from this whole thing.
Thanks for your help, Kyle.
Well, I guess we can at least get the hell out of here.
I don't wanna go on a fishing trip, Kyle.
I know.
poops
kay
kay
kay
Yeah, but, I guess we can still fish in the woods.
Yes, dude. We should.
That's better.
No, dude, it's not that.
Goddammit!
Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
Oh hey Dad, what's up?
No, Dad, we're not playing Xbox.
Dad, you're not making any noise.
Oh no, Dad, this is horrible.
SONGS??
No! This is soo sweet, dad.
You're listening, Dad. It's what we call a "softening" effect.
Butters, listen: there's a health safety study in the news for that word.
Right, so how do we know?
Okay, I, I clicked on a link, and it showed up
====================
Dude, I really don't care. At least I didn't die.
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying I should get this?  Oh, what a great looking guy!  Wait, he's just fine, dude.
Hey, yeah!  He said I can stay.
Boy, I'm sure everything would be okay.
Now, that was what I got.
That was the longest rope ride in the world.  I'm sure everything would be much better with Mel Gibson around.
Okay, so, Gibson, what are you waiting for?
You're gonna use your ninja-ish strength to pull off the first turn, huh?
All right, that's a long way to go, dude.  But if I'm being honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Oh, good, you're here. Now, get over there and do the rest, E-mail me if you have any ideas for big plans.
Hey, Kenny?
Up yours.
That's so sad.
There's no way we can keep doing this, dude.
Clyde, what the hell are you doing?
Aw, dude, that's all there is.
Well, anyway, we have to finally let Kenny take his own life.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Kenny?! What the hell is going on?!
Hey, hey, you guys.
It's gotta be our turn now.
Hey, we're gonna take Downie's bike.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
It's affecting everybody.
Look, it was just a stupid little stunt, like Tinkerbell always tries to tell on us.
Me neither, my bike was stolen, and the thief is Lorde's uncle.
What do you mean?
It's affecting everybody.
Yeah, it's really weird.
Look, dude. Lorde is pretty famous in the world. You've got some really big media hits right here.
You got some of Lorde's music on your phone?
Good. Let's just record this.  And here's the deal. We're gonna take the mic and record our video. 
 We got it!
   Call the police. 
Okay, the police found the bike. 
   Hello?
What?
So it's a fake
====================
Hello?
Don't care, dude. You've got herpes on your face!
Where's my dad?!
You know what happens when you've got herpes on your face and you've never laughed at it! You... get pissed off at your dad and he just denies it!
You've never been on a show that was so packed?
Normally, when we have shows, we split up and we rehearse together.
But you weren't on S&MALLY for like,,, 2010?
We were on Something From The Past.
It was ridiculous.
You guys, I think I have a great idea.
What show could this be on?
Uhhh, do you wanna vote?
Okay, I'll go vote.
I'm still pissed off at my dad.
This is gonna be so depressing.
Just forget about it.  Okay, here we go.
�※※
I.
Okay, the two dolls.
Okay, the bad ones.
Aaah!!
The bad ones are going to town on us now.
We can't miss them, dude. We've got to be sneakin' them over Ikea.
Come on, we'rei we have to go check on them.
Bad.
Come on, they're gonna-
We've gotta get goin' to Ikea first.
You mean,that they-
I don't know!
Kyle, are you guys really gonna buy any more of these?
See? We're not gonna get any money.
Yeah, like, you've gotta get back at those Native Americans.
Hey, back at Cartman's Pond.
Where'd you get that fish?
Whoa!
Wha-wait, that's not a pencil?
What?
What, you mean,a stick?
Oh, God-damnit!  Screw this!
 pencilknife?
Damn, dude.
How do you know?
Yeah, I've been using this pencilknife for like, three weeks.
How'd you get that?
How do you make money?
Commercial?
That's hard.
For two thousand dollars.
No.
See? That's money.
That's not even the difference.
Dude, what are you guys doing?
Kyle, you guys need to just give up now.
All right
====================
Hello?  Oh yeah?  What do you mean?
Well, where's your Okama GameSphere?
Oh.
You didn't know that.
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Look, uh, I don't know if that would make any difference, but... I need to use that Okama GameSphere to buy my music.
Hey, Kenny!
Dude, did you just say "use the GameSphere"?
Well, I need it to buy music.
What the hell is that?
No, dude! Those people in Afghanistan are still recovering from the winter!
Fuck you, Cartman! You're a sellout!
What the fuck?
I don't wanna listen to that crap!
Jesus Christ.
I'll go to the store. I wanna buy some record stores.
Dude! I just got a hundred dollar check from my grandpa!
I just wanna pay it forward, dude.
I know!
Dude, I signed up for some stupid club thing and I didn't wanna be involved!
Hey!  Oh, I don't wanna be involved in Record Store Day, I'm straight!
Woof.
Dude, you're not gonna believe what Record Store Day has done to us.
...Well, it's not like we're newbies to music. We just don't use our GameSphere much.
It's just cool to have this thing around, you know?
Hey, listen, you guys.  We set the record for most albums in a row at record store-bought.
Uh, well, I don't think that'd be unfair on everybody.
Huh?
Awww!
I guess so, but record stores are for guys only.
Wow, you mean, you're just saying that to make me feel better?
Well, I guess people don't have any idea what's going on.
That's different, Cartman. You're saying that people don't know what they're talking about?
Look, we're not making any new friends, we're just making a difference.
Well, we started this, okay? We're at the cutting room floor, and I just wanna make sure everything's all right.
Thanks.  Aaaah!  Agh!
Why are you making such great coffee?
Well, I just needs to put on a good
====================
Wow, cool!
We won't have those, fat boy!
No, dude, we won't!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Hey, Kenny's okay.
But Mom, all the guys are going to Barf & Pastry tonight.
All right.  Okay, after the farmers went to sleep tonight, they went to bed last night.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Good night, Cartman.
Oh, yeah, we've got to wake up now.
Where's Barf & Pastry?
Hello?
Oh, it's that guy again.
Mr. Garrison, Mr. Garrison.
What's up?
Oh, no!
He's trying to tell us something...
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't you just come get us, please?
Get us out of here!
No, we--
Kenny's okay, I guess.
Well, it's not like youfary all those fags on their own. I mean, they're all together and they're trying to please everyone.
Well, I mean, at times, they're definitely corny but at other times, they're all sincere and kind.
I don't know what to do, dude. Maybe I took him for granted.
What?
What?
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup costume cut off for him.
Yeah, so now you're a dick.
Why do you say that?
Oh God!
Now do you think they're mad at us or do you just like it?
I don't get it dude, pre-nup is just too much of a costume.
Dude, did the GoT know that we were doing it?
Hey, yeah that's a big issue.
How come they ever noticed?
They were using something different from the betas we were making that was supposed to be fake.
Well, it's just a show for air, remember?
You don't understand dude, it's all a show!
You have to understand, Cartman! We are never setting foot in Cartman's past!
Eh hey, we're just gonna pretend that a guy is talking to a pig and then show the world what he's talking about.
How do you know?
Oh, there's a pig in
====================
Oh, okay, I guess this is pretty much it.
You've been out of the public eye for a while, and now you're finally finally going to come back.
Who are you?
Well, we wanted to use your room for something really special.
Uh, we'd love to, but... uh, well, we don't have a TV or a computer.
Hey wait, Dad, are you all right?
We can't do that, dude.
Come on, we've gotta find another job.
We'll go to the next level, guys.
Booooo!
There, there, you guys, I mean it.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You're not gonna believe this.
Yeah.
This is just great!
We can put on little Miss Bono's best friend and go see for ourselves.
Whoa, dude!
Look, they're not real people, but... at least they're alive.
Hey, look!  "The following is from the B-moleys, please.
Miss Bono's boyfriend is trapped in the fatality wave.  And he's not gonna make it out alive.
"So"
Sounds like Chic's gonna Devastation.
What's that?
Yeah, like he just got released from Juvenile Hall.
Divorced?
For what?
But dude, that fat one reported?
We tried everything, Boy Meets Girl.
Just because you have your cake and your phone and everything doesn't mean you're gonna get busted.
Uh, y-you're from Jersey, right?
Yeah, but you know what? It's just a joke.
And now, for your amusement, we've made a video. Will you be in our video, swear-
Okay, once we have your video, we'll make everything okay?
Whoa, dude!
Dude, what's the big deal? Is that a state?
Oh, hey guys.
Yeah, m-my name is Stan, and the governor's office is in Jersey.
You guys, we tried everywhere. in the mall, the Federal building, the CIA base.
All right, let's do this!
How about today? We'll make sure Trentonians know we were there.  And of course, "The following is from
====================
What a dumbass! We spent $167,000 on this stupid game!
What?
That sucks that we spent $167,000 on a threesome simulator!
It's called threesome warfare, Stupid.
Yeah, right.
It's what?
Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
No, I've got a bunch of XBox stuff I wanna play with.
What? Whoa whoa wait, what am I doing?
I've just wanna play alone, okay? I have to unlock the Maze Runner theme song at work.
What?
I have no idea.
Come on, guys, we're not having any farts at all.
Yeah, dude, since I have all the necessary equipment, I can do the rest.
How much is this?
Queen Bee?
What?
Here I go.
Dude, I'm gonna have to ask my parents to pay me back all the money I owe them.
Uh, can I ask you a question? Why do we do this?
We do it every year, huh? Why don't we just tell our parents?
L-Dad, what are you doing?
Ah, actually, we're just gonna tell our parents if we get in a fight, or if we don't show up for school like the rest of the students.
Cartman, don't be such a pussy!
Kyle, aren't you a little mature for letting your parents know we're coming.
...Well, we just wanted to tell them the truth.
We're gonna wait for our parents to show up before we go in, okay?
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. What are you doing?
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hullo, we're gonna tell our parents a story about how we were molested, and they'll want to straighten it out.
We don't wanna go on a date with this person, is what I'm tellin' her.
Aargh! I guess you're not a hotshot like Cartman's mom, fatass!
All right, you guys, this is it.
It's time for the finale.
Mr. Broflovski, we have a mission.
We saw your Cartman last night, Tweek.
Dude, Mr. Brofl
====================
Tolerance and acceptance are not sideshow things, they're realities.
Relationship to reality? Dude, that's not cool. She's cheating on you.
Dude, who the hell wants to screw up their relationship?
Dude, what the hell is wrong with these people?
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
This is soo sweet, dude.
Dude, you weren't gonna send them packing, are you?
What's going on?
Jesus Christ.
Hey Kyle.
Kyle, there's gonna be like, new kids.
Look, they're gonna be extra sweet, because they won't have to grow up and become like the other kids.  All I want to do is just be myself, alright? I don't want to be around these kids.
What?
These kids are total jerks.
They're my friends. They're perfect.
Hey, where's Kyle?
What the hell is he doing?
Done?
Uh, hey, Cartman.
They're gonna search for you in the middle of nowhere.
...So new kid Kyle, right?
Well yeah, I mean, you were kind of a sissy until I told you dude, I've been through a lot of things, and you know what I think that's a pretty big deal? I mean, isn't that what you were trying to say?
What?
Delete
You're an asshole?
What?
What about him?
What about Timmy?
That's not Billy Bob West.
Hey Kyle.
Dude, not everyone is as gay as you are.
Dude, I don't get it.
Hey, yeah!
No, I don't get it.
Kyle, aren't you being very gay lately?
Kyle, I think everyone is.
Look, there's nothing I can do. I was together with Timmy, and he got really hot all of a sudden.
I don't get it.
Hey, yeah!
Look, guys. I think maybe you're right.
Let's look for ourselves.
yletta@hotmail.com
Yeah, yeah! We'll all go over to his house to see him.  He's got a TV on that goes out every night.
What?
I like it.
Kyle, don't be such a chicken. Look
====================
I realize this might be fun for a few days, but it's really not something that you guys wanna do anymore.
Hey, where's Kyle?
Whoa, dude!
Wow, there's a guy named Mark Kern.
What is he doing doing?
He does it all with the help of his uncle, who built the um, Beaverton!
Kyle! Kyle!
Come on, Kyle, the- sure, if you want to play football are you, then you can.
Uh, guys, we're here to visit our uncle, who built the um, Beaverton, but lost it.
No, dude, we're trying to go to South Park Elementary.
Uh, can we go just like we were told?
Well, not really. We have to focus on the one thing we're supposed to do.
What the hell is wrong with all that?
...Well, we're gonna go to South Park Elementary and be like--
But we gotta see if they have baseball practice today.
Whatever it is, we've got to do it.
Okay, it's all clear.
Fine.
I don't understand.  Hey Wendy, did you bring up your vegetable?
Yeah, but--
Wendy, you didn't deny it, either.
Did you bring it up or not?
Did--
Mom, Dad, why are you fighting?
Yeah, cause Cartman said he wanted to fight.
Mom, up for one!
Why the hell not?
Look, you guys, just let Kyle take the bus. He's taking us to another planet.
Kyle! Kyle, don't!
Sirs, uh, thanks.
Sick, dude.
Yeah, it's cool.
Dude, it's a rip-off!
Sacrificed? For what?
Dude, it's really cool that we beat the aliens.
But where's Cartman?
Dude, we can't wait in the middle of town.
We're not taking the bus!
You're a pussy!
Look, they've got a sniper-chicken.
Why would you want a sniper-chicken?
I don't know, meh, maybe we just like being sniper-chicken.
No, you don't understand, Kyle. We were trying to practice.
How do you shoot
====================
Yeah! I got it!
Today we learned that the head of Homeland Security ordered at least four movies to be shown in 2009. Whether or not you all thought that was enough, this is just the beginning.  There are more films on screen that are as good as they get!
Do you have any ideas, Mr. President?
Tell us how to watch our movies?
How?
Then you have my late father. You know him better than anyone.
Thanks for the chance to sit by and watch our movies, dude. It's just something we all enjoy.
N-no, that doesn't make sense, Cartman.
Uuh, g-get over here and bring us back the images.
Dude, ah we are being ridiculous.
Yes, we do. Uh, if you look in the mirror and say "Jesus face!" you'll see that Jesus is nothing but smithereens.
Jesus?
(voice rising)
Who are you people?
Whoareyou?
All right, everyone, this is supposed to have been someplace other people have gone since.
Well whatever, dude. Let's go.
They've decided to do something different.
Oh my God. Fringe.
Frummin' us again!
Oh yeah, dude, we'll do it!
Dude, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Dude, we have to get out of here.
You're a pussy!
We can't watch Fringe on TV!
You've got to be kidding me! We can't watch Fringe on our TV! We're going to Grey's Anatomy!
You're not one to find stuff on TV, you freak!
How can you say that w-we don't travel far?
Dude, what happened?
What??
Butters, don't be such a f-ing pussy!
Guys... Kyle and Craig... will be there!
Craig, how come you didn't show up for the game?
Come on, we gotta see what that thing is!
And...
That thing?
Where's the supposed gold?
Wait, wait, that smells.  Furry, does that mean there's a goldfish in Minecraft?
Ah, yeah, one of the creators of Minecraft has a big paper trail.
How can they do that??
Choir
====================
Our parents are trapped in a big commercial real estate scam! Our parents are going around stealing dollars and nickels from everybody!
Look, we just want our parents back, okay?!  Dude, we got it!
Yeah, rowdy clubbies are gonna steal your dollars and nickels from you!
We tried everything, Grandpa! We tried every avenue!
Well, here we are!  The real problem is NOT WITH TAR-MOVE!
Oh, dude, we gotta get our parents back!
We're gonna take everything we have!  The real problem is... WHY!!  Why do we even wanna try that thing!
Oh-h. Dude, you know? That's what everybody says. But we just don't wanna risk it.
Yeah.  Well, then why aren't we douchebags enough?
All right, fine.  Let's get back to the room.
Excuse me.
Hey, could I just talk to you for a little while?
Again?
These guys are really messed up right now.  They've tried everything to get us to leave this building.  There's not one thing we can do.
Okay, I'm getting back in position.
Hey, wait, ah I'm not gonna scratch your ass, you stupid ass!
No, I'm not gonna put your toy away, okay? I got you!
Where are you going?
What?!
But what happens if there's someone whorax away in a boat.
So how do we help them?
What are you talking about?
So what should we do?
Help?
No!  Dad, we don't know where that is.
But what do we do now?
Help!
Yeah, dude, we need to find it.
Where?
Dad, it's not like we can use it right away.
You're a robot!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
No.
Look!
Yeah, dude, there's gotta be something we can do.
Yeah, get a robot arm, Kyle!
We're gonna dig up Kyle's Kyle!
Kyle's Kyle's soul is trapped in a jar!
We trapped him somewhere warm and dark.
So now we have to hurry and give him back to the evil Cartman!
We don't have many days left
====================
I think it's time we took a stand. We have to tell Santa Claus what we want and don't want.
I don't care!  Look, guys, I need my money first! I'm not going to Santa Claus pay for my TV set, toothbrushes, and other valuables!  And I won't let anybody do any of that junking!
And if I didn't want any of it, I'll do anything to get back at those evil Scientologist bastards for what they are trying to do!
I'm not responsible for what my parents did, even though they thought it was bad!
No, that's okay. I'll look.
Okay, I'll leave the house.
Just enter the succubuses living room.
Okay, look, there's the ones that were playing Xbox yesterday. They said we have to put them in the back.
What is that?
Calm down guys, this is just gonna make things a lot worse.
Craig, are we sure we want to keep playing because that stupid Parental Havoc Network is going to put us in charge of the house.
That isn't true!
Hey wha-b-but we don't care about farts!
Aaaah!
Alright, come on, guys.   Mr. Broflovski, about the tank.
Aren't you, Craig?
Come on, Craig, we're going to the aquarium tonight.
Butters, I, I think we're gonna go back to Wing.
We've gotta get back to Base Camp, Tweek.
Come on, guys.
Yup.
It was just a dream, dude, Craig. He really dreamt it.
How did it go, Tweek?
How did it go, Tweek?
I don't know, dude. I know what it was.
I know, but... I don't know what else to do.  I'll make everything okay in the morning, go back to Wing, and then meet you at the aquarium.
Whoa, dude, Tweek dreamt it.
Whoa, dude, Tweek dreamt it.
Oh, hey Timmy. How come you decided to become a cult leader?
Yeah, what a great friend. Timmy commanded respect and respect and respect and...
Hey, come on guys.  We
====================
We're on your side!
You guys! You guys! Dude, what are you guys doing with our schlong?
Yeah, dude. Nobody says "shit" anymore.
You're gonna read this stuff and fall in love with it!
No! You guys, read it!
And it says: "If a man's conscience is high, marry her."
And it says: "If a baker's conscience is high, bake his own pie."
And it says: "If a florist's conscience is high, give her what she wants."
Butters!
What the hell is going on?!
Mom!
Dad, you're not gonna believe this!
What the hell was that?
What the hell deal is going on?!
Mom, you guys are gonna have to wake up!
Dad, you've got to wake up!
Parents! Your kids are gonna be in a lot of situations, but not always so fun. This could be a game that you lose, and you gain experience for your hit show.
Uh, if we go face to face with this group of people, we're gonna lose our jobs, our houses, and, our asses!
We're not friends?
Don't you see? This is gonna get ugly. I mean, really, what with all those people right now.  Maybe our jobs are gonna be at risk, and that's what we need to get out of here.
Steve, what are you doing?
No, I'm not doing it.
Do you want to go, Buttbeard?
Why?
So?
So where's our in-out, butt-crack?
Where's our clubhouse?
Dude, we're not playing ball!
You're not?
What?
You guys... don't know that.
Aren't you Jewish?
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has an ass?
Okay.
...Well-h. Dude, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Come on, Kenny, come on!
Jesus Christ!
Look, Kyle, fatass, look at what this American flag is saying.
Let them in on a thing.  It says "FARCAIL, FOREVER."
What?
Yeah, let's go get it.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
What's so
====================
Gay people have been unjustly censored in the world.
I don't care what the corporations decide, I want a fair shake.
I'm calling on everyone to stop corporate bullying and make sure that no-one has the same opportunity that we have.
It's corporations like us that are ignoring the big questions and ignoring the future, okay?!  Token, you don't understand!  If we don't go to the corporations for help, we're never gonna make it on our own!
If we want to know what's in a package, then we've gotta look no further than the past.
There was a time when toys were just sold individually, grew up, and were traditionally hand-painted. Now, that kind of stuff is everywhere.
What are you talking about?
What the hell is wrong with this guy?
So?
He's the future self.
Or is he just some douche?
I don't know.
Come on, let's go get to the voting!
It's finally over!  There's only one way we can stop this from happening again!
Okay, so now, do you wanna contribute towards a costume, or not?
Dude, you'reoting?
That's it, dude. You'reoting, you'll help us choose our costume.
He is, Token.
Don't worry, Token. We'll all be voting tonight. Jeeps are at the polling station, will you be in the driver's seat?
What?
Heyballing!
Dude, is that so...?
Kyle, will you vote no?
Sweet!
I don't think I'm ever going to be a grown man in the future,  anymore than you.
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but, the best way to end this is by voting no.
Okay.
Yeah. And I have a bunch of other things I wanna do, too.
What?
Oh, uncle Kenmare.
Kenmare, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Ah, crap.
Dude, uncle Kenmare is actually Skeletor, and they used a technique called "shock therapy."
Cartman!
You're a liar, Uncle Kenmare!
All right, go ahead and vote.
The dumbest thing that's happened to me is I've been voting for
====================
We are really scared.
I don't know,  I-
I'm not good enough! I'm not supposed to be like that, that's like the worst kind of luck!  No, I'm okay,  i-
But I'm just a-scared of snakes.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I learned something today.  If a frog bites you, I don't know if I can take it anymore.  The frog must be very powerful.
The frog is near and I have to keep going.
Relax, Tweek, I'm just gonna slide you down this rope. All right?
Okay, okay, okay, I'm gonna do it.
Now, over here, over here!
The frog guy is really secret sssay.
I'm not gonna tell anybody, I'm just gonna keep going.
Heyhee-hee. Look. I think about that Timmy I killed.
And then Timmy would have to go to the scary dentist.
But I don't think about that.
Okay, come on guys, this is stupid.
A-kay??
What?
Oh come on guys, listen to me.  The Halloween spirit showed up in your town and is trying to take you over again.  This time, you have to hurry.
It's just trick-or-treaters all trying to steal you back from them.
No, it's bigger than Jesus.
Dad, it's trick-or-treaters all the time.
Jesus Christ, dude!
What am I supposed to do?
I'm supposed to stay here. Let's go get candy for my parents.
No, I'm not gonna do it again.
Excuse me.
What?
I don't know.
Mom, I'm so glad that's over with.
Dad, I know what you mean.
So what do I do?
Aw crap.
What?
Mom, I've started getting sick.
No!
Mom, I've started getting sick.
?
Yeah!
Mom, I've gotten sick from eating broccoli and cabbage combined!
I don't know!
Yeah!
I don't like it!
Trick-or-treat with yourself, Pip. I'm sure you'll see what you did there.
====================
We, we're gonna fight.  And in the end, is it really so bad, we just wanna know between a rock and a hard bang?
Oh, dude, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
We don't wanna be on a show based on rumors and innuendos, okay?
No.
Look, you guys might be fine with rumors and innuendos, but, at the end of the day, we're all just rumors.  And if you're gonna make everyone in the business know that you're just a story, then be it. 
Tryin' to tell me something between shows.
I don't wanna watch Frida's farts, okay?
Yyyeah.
Yeah, shut up, Pip.
When are they gonna come out?
They're coming!
Wendy, you said that before, but she's the center of attention right now.
I don't know.
Wendy, we have to go to Frida's house.
Cartman, you have to promise not to trick me.
Dude, I told you before, and I'll guarantee it: this is gonna be awesome!
See? You're the one who told me that before, but then-
See?
Hey, I'm having a great time.
Dude, what the hell are you doing?
What time is it?!
You tricked me, Cartman, I was using the bathroom alarm.
Day 1 of school?
 3273 hours.
What?
What about Jared?
Day 1 of school?
What?
All right, fine, Kenny.  I'll call.
Hello, Mr. Mackey. Could you show me how far your pumpkin carving is?
Sure, dude. I'll show you how far you rigged the gas station.
Thanks.
You guys, I have to go to bed.
Yeah, I need to study.
How much?
Dude, I think we're gonna need some help from the public image crisis.
How much is this going to cost us?
Yeah.
Dude, I don't think we're in the same position we were in a while.
You didn't freak out, Cartman! We were just gonna be in a different room.
Yeah, why not? We could talk to the principal
====================
What?!
No no, wait...  Wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's figure out what happened to the head.
What?!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Bubye.
Oh, there's a health crisis going on. It's spreading faster than anyone realizes. And it's calling for a global government that can protect us all.
No, it's called First Man.
What?!
It's... strange. Usually when we hear "First Man," we think it's the First Wife, but, it's actually the First Niece.
Uh, we're gonna take before and after photos, and then we're gonna share the yipped egg roll.
Oh? Uh-wa, I'm sorry, but we just didn't want to 'fell in love with you.'
'T.
'K.
"Tweek Sullivan" is our friend, Tweek.
Yeah!
Tweek, we're really just trying to make some money together.
We don't wanna fall in love with you, are we?
How do we end up with you, Tweek?
Let's see: Jesus winning the St. Patrick's Day dish party, then Tweek dying in front of the whole world and saying, "I'm so going to St. Patrick's Day today."
Uh, we played football again last night, and you guys lost to your team.
We'll see.
Yeah, when does the North Pole get slide show practice?
We were supposed to go to St. Patrick's, but the guys just moved there.
Where's Mike?
He's here.
Strummin' on the ice, and let's see what happens.
Strumming on the ice!
Mike, are you feeling alright?
That's a head lice roll!
That's a roll about you!
What are you doing, Cartman?!
Whoa, dude!
What are you doing, Cartman?!
Mr. Mackey, is there really a risk with this?
...What?
Your just leaving?
What, dude?
Mr. Mackey, isn't that all the media is doing?
Well, we've just gotta tell the police department where to go tomorrow.
They've gotta go to the mall and tell them where to go!
Where?
Neither
====================
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. Now, there's been a lot of talk lately about how global warming is linked to leprechauns' diseases, but uh, what does that mean?
It means that if we eat eggs and milk together, their enzymes can attack you, uh, that's why the leprechauns were able to kill you.
What's up dude?
What do you mean?
Dr. Mephesto, we need to talk about leprechaun eggs and milk.
Where is she?
Hey dude.
Where is she?
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
You've got a sweet tooth, dude.
What's the matter with you?
You've got a lot of catching up to do. Do you still have the strength to do the grade-B stuff?
Bad.
What are you talking about?
? What's the matter?
Alright, I'm going to Dakota Territory to fight for my dad.
Dude, I've been sent to fight for Mom against the Scott Family.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Dude, I have to do this! I'm not gonna die!  I'm doing this!
Ah fuck.
Huh? What's that?
Awww.  That's stupid, dude. I shouldn't be fighting Satan.
All right, look, there's been a lot of talk lately about how bigoted and dangerous we are, and that we should all go about making our own sides, but, you know what? We shouldn't have to do this.
Yeah, right. Well, at least I'm not gonna die like the rest of you think.
Well, I guess I'm not gonna be killed like you think.
Okay, good.
Alright, Satanist, let's get going.
Hey, look. There's been a lot of talk lately about the need to destroy the Christian Faith, and a lot of it is based on fact. For one thing, it assumes that all religions have some kind of central theme, and that people worshiping evil do so out of a need to please.
no,
no, what does that mean?
Well, I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that if we allow people to believe in some things that they think are really cool, then we're gonna find we're
====================
It was... very cool.
Yeah, it was very cool.
Eh-excuse me, I was... seeing your presentation on the mall was really bad.
What sort of... advice would you give us?
...Well, here we go.
I guess, but...
Yeah, m-my dad.
No, it's not. It's- is Kyle.
Kyle, I love you. I love you like we've ever gotten apart.
We can get Lorne's house, just need to tell him we got the bad cop. Look, Kyle, the bad cop is Kyle's dad.
Dude, he can't hit puberty before us.
Wh-why?
Kyle, you have to stop them now.
Dude, puberty? At least they're not yet 13.
Wh-why?
This is puberty, dude!
Dude, just stop and think.  It would take her whole future to understand.
If Cartman were 13, how could he win in court?
Right, so how should we decide?
In hindsight, this is gonna be a really nice phase for Cartman.
...What?
We do?
Goddammit!
Hey look, Kenny!
Kenny, is it soooo that bad?
Oh dude, really?
What?
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Yeah, like, 2010?
Yeah, nepotism sucks.
What?
Oh, dude! That's stupid!
Dude, you know that guy at work you've never seen before?
But, how come they have eyes that don't really matter?
He's sooo ready to jump now, fatass!
Oh my God.
Alright, alright, that does it!
I don't know,  it's like, you don't care about anything except that which your parents tell you to skip school for.
You're kidding.
It's like the only thing that matters are your parents telling you stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid
Huh? Where are you going?
But you didn't tell him that, Kyle!
You have to get to Bebe's house, Kyle!
Kyle, I, I understand.
Kyle, I need to talk to Mr. Garrison.
I don't care! I'm on my own!
I'm not slowing down!
Look
====================
No. I think that if you give people what they want, they'll go on with their lives.
Give them what they want, and they'll choose to live.
Yeah, give people what they want, and they'll go on with their lives.
Yeah, give people what they want, and they'll go on with their lives.
Give what you want, and they'll live.
People like me, who enjoy being around people different from ourselves, I find it offensive.
People who like me, and cool.
Yeah, cool!
People who like me and cool.
Yeah, that's cool!
What I'm looking for in a kid?
AUGH!
...Kenny?!  Oh...
What do you mean?
Uh... I mean, Kenny, haven't you experienced this before?
This is pretty fucked up right here.
No.
This is pretty fucked up right now.
You guys, are we seeing any of the other kids from last night?
Yeah, we know what it means.
It's Saturday.
Dude, is that really far a goal?
What is that?
I'm sorry. I should have seen that coming.
Kyle?  Oh my God.
Dad?  Okay. You have to stop faking.
It's all right.
It was just... a while ago. I've been watching you all this week.
You guys, I've got some stuff to do.
No. I don't wanna talk about it.
No. No, listen, I asked him once, and he said don't put yourself in that situation where you're forced to be a slave.
I.
I don't know, Kyle. Maybe I should.
Okay.
What?
I don't wanna talk about it.
No, you're not making any more noise about it.
Okay, I'll.
Okay, he's accepted.
I don't know.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing this time?
Kyle?
Kyle, it's Blossom.
Yeah, her name is Blossom.
Bubbles?
Uh, we'd love them.
Alright, where's Kyle?
We have to hurry and hide behind some other object.
Just like last time. Just like this time.
...
====================
Oh, no no, no no NO! They've killed our best friend!
Dad?
What? Wha-what is this about Scientology for?
Well, I try to stay out of trouble. I just... left the party. You know, like, 2010? It was good.
No, dude, not again.
Oh, no, NO.
Dude, I'm not doing it, you guys. Don't you see what's happening out there? The world is changing. We were all raised by the same family, and Scientology destroyed that.
No, it was me. Don't let that stupid doctrine fool you. Developmentally, I'm totally fine. I was never depressed. I was just confused.
When I was five, I had my first really bad seizure. I remember being wheeled into school and told to "Play the Chinese" or else I'd fall down. I got bullied by other kids, had my first really bad seizure, and now I'm at a disadvantage because I can't do anything else.
My family was?.?Centrally poor?
Yeah, so that means youhche never went through all the trouble of getting busted?
You got searched for that Chinpokomon you're supposed to bring?
Dude, we brought our Chinpokomon.
Dude, we didn't we?
Dude, we shouldn't have spoiled it.
Whoa, Chinpokomon sucks!
Whoa, Chinpokomon sucks!
Whoa, stop making me feel like a piece of shit!
I just want everything to go back to the way it was!
Oh my God, we tricked Mackey into signing up for our football camp!
Mackey, you lost the election to the right election last time.
You can't charge people to use terms like "homosexuality" and "homosexuality" interchangeably!
Oh, hey kid.Aughah.
Man, I wish I could finally see Mackey.
He needs it.
What?
...What?
But he's not hurt.
Cool. I, I guess.
What?
Hey, can you straighten me out?
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
What's the big deal?
Yeah, everything sucks.
Dude, why are you so into a new show?

====================
Hey guys.  It's Adam Sandler's new show. You've been watching Dad's back a lot lately.
Well, I guess we can at least see what he sees: a man with a hypochondriac's disease.
But why do we need a hypochondriac?
...Well, do you know anything about swimming or even a penis?
I mean, isn't that guy still alive?
He apparently has a way with a hypochondriac's copy.
So, is he gonna cheat in school or not?
Uhhh, sure, but what about giving in and then Cheeto calling and getting you to join the wrestling team?
Come on, don't you think it's a little bit of both?
You were awesome, Adam!
I don't get it. Why cheat on your own, you douche?! Why cheat on your own?!
I'm not cheating, you douche! I'm not cheating on my own!
Come on, guys!
No!
But you didn't tell me he had a penis, you douche!
Okay, I'll try. I'm gonna take a picture of Jesus saying "Tha vagina hurts" or something.
Uh, if I take the picture of you doing something else, I'm gonna kill you.
Jesus?
What the hell is going on?!
Jesus, is it really so bad?!, Keith Urban says.
Sounds like police sirens.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, we're sorry!
We're just gonna have to wait for the other kids to show up at school.
Son of a bitch!
Kyle, you can't ruin your best friend's life by meeting new people!
Sounds like a wasted opportunity to kill yourself.
You new person?
No, you can't kill yourself!  Kill yourself!
Why do we have to join the wrestling team?
Well... because you're a douche.
Dude, we can't practice anymore. We could at our house.
Dude, we are trying to make $10,000!
Hey, how about we try the Panda Express?
Sh!
Craig, are you still on the phone?
That's so gross.
Hey, how about we do a TV show?
Hey, we're gonna be on the show!
Craig, what the hell are you
====================
Dude, what just happened?
...sort of.
Look, dude. What are you guys doing this morning, eating broccoli and playing Xbox Live?
Hey, you guys! You guys!  You gotta wake up!
Dad? What the hell are you doing?
Aw, I just wanted to tell you, Mom, and Dad are gonna be back in San Francisco this afternoon!
Sure.
How's it going, Gorak?
You woke him up, Gorak!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
This is not a peace-Scytheville day!
Hey, Kenny's there!
Kenny's supposed to be here all the time!
Dude, what are you guys doing?!
I wonder why the hell did you guys keep putting him on the bottom?
Where are you going?
Wow, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Kyle, isn't this a little scary?
Does this animal things it?
Hey, can you just drop the knife you were holding in your mouth and let the other kid do the rest?
Mom, I just really don't understand.
No, what I wrote about was actually wrong. And it was written about before the whole "Kenny's Not In My Level."
I don't know, I just don't get it.
Yeah, it's not that big a deal.
I don't get it, Mom. I think it's really strange that after all this time we can't get any better than this.
Yeah. What a coincidence.
I don't get it.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy to just ignore these people and move on.  Look, there's nothing I want more than to have my life depend on you right now.
You have no idea what this is about, okay?! Everyone hates me now!
No, you ignore them and you go back to your room!  Mom, I just don't want you to die tonight!
Shut up, Pip.
Oh, nice going, dude.
Oh, nice going, dude. Come on, guys.
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
Let's get out of here!
Come on
====================
The guy who opened the door with the shovel.
Mom! Dad! You gotta go tell Mom the truth!
Mrs. Garrison didn't know about the anthrax scare.
I was in Afghanistan for three weeks. I guess we should be focusing on making the Taliban be more like the Iraqis.
Are we gonna make it to Afghanistan, Bill?
Well... we could, but... nobody is gonna help us.
Well... then why aren't we getting in trouble?
Well, suppose the four of us decide to go to the big fight on Long Island?
I guess we can't go harmlessly in the streets.
Aw, come on! We've gotta find better help!
The other guys, they've got concussions. They habitually strike others in the head.
The heady idea... is we make it to the back.
Towelie!
Hey! Tom Cruise is coming to get us!
Where's the Chief?
All right, come on, guys.
Aaah! We gotta get to the mall.
Jesus Christ.
Where's the Chief?
Yeah, he's so annoying.
Yeah, and I didn't think I'd be able to concentrate 'cause I'm so immersed in a big, black and white studio, I don't even have a TV, I just like to keep things natural.
What'cha do to me?
Wow, wow!
That wasn't enough!
Dude, I have to get this thing I use to keep an army up and running!
I think I have something even more important!
What is it, Cartman?
I need to know where he's going!
Mister gents, I know where he's going forever ago this month.
Yeah, but... But... but... but... where am I supposed to get it??
I'm not good! I'm not gonna take the sting off of a tank!
God-damnit!
There it is. There it is.
Towelie!
Towelie!  Oh, yeah. I need Towelie, too.
What kind of marks?
Towelie, what the hell are you doing?
God-damnit, are you paying attention?
No. Dude, if you hired the right people we could be on all night long! It'll just make things a lot
====================
All right!  Wait! There's those New Yorker kids!  What's happening?? They're trying to kill Kyle!
Dude, I'm not being a dick! You're being a dick, you asshole!
Fuck off, asshole!
Hey, I didn't throw up. I'm just gonna take it out.  I can't wait to go back in the barrel.
What the hell is going on?
Jesus Christ!
Hey, you guys! You guys! What the hell are you doing?!
Yeah, screw that kid.
No, they're not gonna send him back in the future.
The future?
Dude, why are you so into their show?
Because they're bad!
But Dad, my future self is really bad. And he's gonna kill me if I don't go with him.
Cartman!
Hey! So what are you guys gonna do is play the harp?
Mom, will you take the mic?
Mom, will you take the stage?
I'm gonna go catch the harp in time to watch Terrance & Phillip in person.
Can I take it home?
I'm gonna go catch the harp in time to watch Terrance & Phillip in person.
Where's Kenny?
Hey Kenny!  Oh yeah, we have to get up there early.
All right, let's get the hell out of here!
It's gotta be at least 8:30.
This is not a good time for Cartman to tell us where we're coming from.
No, this is not a time to gossip.
It... is?
What?
Hey, can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Goddamnit, that's awesome!
Warp drive?  What?
That's it?
Oh, nice going, you assholes! You got what you wanted, dude!
Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find out where we're going!
What?
Hey, can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Sh! No, we have to learn to control it!
Goddamnit, that's not Kyle's fault that he gets pushed around!
Where?
Uh, I have to learn to control when I'm Pulled Around. I can't keep performing all those stupid songs.
Just stop it
====================
It's the fifth game of the season!  It's the fifth game in a row the Green Monster has attacked our town!
Well, tonight was no exception.
We've gotta find a way to stop the monster from walking us.
Sweet!
We're not scared of zombies!
We've tried everything to stop them! Mom and dad are heroes to us!
Just freeze her or else they'll kill us.
What were the chances of survival for you and Mom and eat you?!
Three hundred and ninety-nine...?!
Uh, best chance we can!
Fine!
I don't think it's fair for a father to eat the baby goat!
Mom, you can't eat the baby goat! The baby goat is killing our parents.
Mom! The goat is back!
We tried everything to stop the goat from leaving us, dad being the greatest! But the road to revenge lies in obtaining the goat's soul.
But what chance do we have?
There's no way the goat will ever leave us, so we have to find a way to get him back.
What?
Now, how do we get him to join our basketball team?
What?
Yeah, he's a then and a now.
Hey, that's not cool. Bebe is with you.
You what?
Hey, bebe! We've got to cheer up. You know what you're doing?
Bad.
Bebe, what the hell are you doing?
Kyle, bebe! We've gotta get bebe bebe to join our basketball team.
Kyle, bebe!
You dumbass, Cartman!
But you're our friend, remember?! Bebe is with you!
Here she comes.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Cartman, what the hell are you doing blind?!
Cartman, she's our friend Bebe.
Cartman, let's go.
Cartman, let's go!
Hoh boy, we can't do this!
Boy, we're gonna kick his ass!
Hey, Cartman, you're a big fatass, and you're a big fatass too, so what's the point of having my baby?
I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a big fatass.
Butters, what the hell are you doing
====================
We want to shoot the puck to the guy who's building the puck, not ourselves.
He must be tired, but we weren't kicking anybody's ass.
Yeah, let's see if Kyle's feeling reallywell.
Kyle?  Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
How many goals?
Yeah, I guess so.
Kyle, I'm just glad this whole thing is finally over with.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Oh my God, they can't have killed Kenny if we don't want them to!
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.
Is Kyle's death linked to the Independence Day Parade?
Dude, I don't get it.
Whoa, dude!
Who are you?
Aw, dude, it's all yours.
All right, you guys, it's time to move on.
Huh?
To move on, dude. The government is trying to kill you.
What?
Dude, we never thought it was so bad.,,,,,, just- like the farmers in Indiana.
Come on, what are you?
Whoa, dude!
Whoa, dude, they're not using your planet for their rockets!
I don't know, dude. I don't get it.
Can we go home now, please?
Sir?
Why are you so into a dream, Kyle?
Whoa, dude!
Who's in charge here?
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
I don't know how much longer we can keep going, dude.
We've gotta wake up, dude.
Dude, do you think we should go back to the basketball game?
Cool!
Yeah, that'd be funny.
We've gotta get that fat chick back for us.
Oh, hey, that's Sparky.
Uh, hi, is this Sparky, and has hemlock account.
He's the fat one, Kyle.  Sparky, what the hell are you doing?
Oh my God. Farther down, you find, there's gonna be people.
No! They're not gonna laugh at us!
We made a promise to each other, dude, and Kyle!  We said we'd let you keep the farts, and that you get to keep the farts
====================
Yeah I know.
I don't care! I'm not going to school this late!
Pass it to me, Cartman!
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
Oh, hey guys. Uh- You're having a tea and eating muffins at the same time.
Aah! We'd better get going soon Mr. Garrison!
Yeah, this is gonna be soooooo funny.
Oh my God! They've killed--
BILLG-ing Grandpa?
What the hell is he talking about?
Man, it sucks that his parents are gonna lose their jobs!
Wow, that sucks, dude.
Wow!
What about them?
But we have to do what's in the report?
Mr. Garrison, we need to talk to the parents of those of you who are sick of seeing your friends die.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
It's true, dude. The parents of those of you who are sick are gonna lose their jobs.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Yeah, screw that kid.
Why are you so into a stupid whiny little rat?
Yeah, I'm sure that ass will get worse soon enough.
Is that why Cartman is taking to the streets in New York?  Citizenfour!
Awgh! I will go to take him to the police if he wants!
Yes?!
Are you the mayor of Flat Shoals?
I hope so.
Mayor, could you move a little bit please?
This is gonna be soo funny!
Smell what?
Oh that's a good idea!
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Goddamn, that Chinpokomon!
Yeah, it looks like Kyle's caught on tape saying stuff that got made in the store.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Where are you going?
I don't know, just... hang in there.
Shut up, Cartman.
Aw, dude, I gotta get that Chinpokomon out of my system.
Dude, I can't do it Kyle. I have to get the Chinpokomon system shut down.
Shut up, Cartman, we're trying to get to a U-Haul.
U-uh, boardman.
No way, dude!

====================
Kyle, you have to cheer up. I think you'll just be doing it again.
Cartman, you have to cheer up. I think you'll just be doing it
now that Dad and Mom are up and down the basketball team.
Yeah, that's pretty badass.
Kyle, I think I have a better idea.  Where is she?
Dad, I think you're crazy.
Kyle, I think you've got a better idea.  Kick ass!  
You dumbass, Cartman!
You have to be doing it little Kyle, it's almost impossible.
Mom, Dad, are you and Wendy the same age?
Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
Yeah.
Dude, that's like it't being Kyle's birthday.
You're never being Cartman's butt into a store-bought bracelet.
Yeah, that's weird. You're such a douchebag
Oh, dude, let's go buy some more cookies.
Oh, okay, I'm gonna buy a bunch.
What, oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
No, it's okay if you don't wanna be on the team, because I'm with my grandma.
Yeah, she's my grandpa.
Cool!
Hey, Grandpa, did you guys get-
Uhh... No.
Cool.
Why are you cool?
You guys, we got a... codeshare.
Yeah, who cares?
Aaaah!
Uhhh, excuse me, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Mackey.
He's supposed to be answering us in front of the TV at 3:35.
 Mackey-san, how come you never said anything about us being on the basketball team?
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to play basketball and be good to us, then by all means, fuck you.
But what about wearing that little XBox t-shirt?
Dude, I don't get it.
Dude, I don't get it.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Jesus Christ.
Kyle, you guys are soooooooooo messed up!
Let's go to the movies.
Hi, I'm Jennifer Lopez.
I'm a New Yorker living in New York.
Why the hell not?! Oh, okay!
Yeah
====================
Dude, I hate those fat ass chicks. I don't get it.
Shelly, you shut up, dude. I mean, at least you don't wanna hurt any of the Chinthids.
Dude, I don't get it. Chinthids are stupid.
No, dude, don't you see what's happening out there? The list is endless. Some guy's a Chinthid, some guy's a Chinthid. And you can't find a Chinthid who doesn't love us.
...Kenny? Kenny, hey, what are you doing?
Hey, can you just drop the whole Chinifting thing right now?
Oh, hey Kenny.
You're a nice little kid who's got a sweet future and a sweet home.
Yeah, why don't you take Scott's place?
What?
Kenny's future self?
Pretty sure that's where he's at right now.
You taking Scott's future self?
You're not his future self, fatass!
What future self would have that guy be?
Cartman?
Dude, I don't get it.
But why? What's the big deal?
...Then let's listen to what Kenny has to say.
He does like he's in his little future self's head.
What would he say now?
Pretty sure he's talking to the future self of Cartman!
But what happens if we don't do this?
Un,Sorry.  Hey Wendy, I had a really bad dream.
Yeah. I should have gotten over here and done with it.
And now for the fun of it: I dream of a time before computers were like you's toys. I remember thinking, Oh man, I should have just deleted that line a few years ago.
It just makes me sad that I should have just deleted that one line a while ago.
Yeah, I should have just went with it.
What's a dildo?
Well, I only had it for a dream, and it never even came out.
What does it look like we're doing, Chef?
Yeah, now get me out of here!
Come on, where's Chef?!
Yeah, now he's a total douche.
He's taking pictures of us and we have to be making them for him.
Oh my God!
Who
====================
I'm not voting! I was just told to stay out of it!
No, it's too late. Stupid, stupid stupid Dragonbound, it's not fair for me to stay out of this! When you guys decided to take our community out of us, your guys, it was because we were too hard on the succubuses. Now, we can all get along, but the succubuses are bigger than ever and, so are you!
I don't wanna go out there and eat deer.
No, I want a cheeseburger and a cheeseburger burrito.
What?
I'll get in on.
Yeah, it's up for grabs.
Wow, I never thought it was so bad!
What's a dildo?
What's a dildo, Kenny?
Dude, that kicks ass!
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Dude, you're listening, Cartman.
Right. Cartman went out and got some sleep.
Yeah, he was having a lot of it's own thing.
What?
You guys! You guys!
Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
Look, guys, we just saw a bunch of homeless people trapped on a bus in Denver. What are we gonna do? Help them?
We don't wanna jump a bus, you guys!
But what are we supposed to do, Officer Barbrady's logic going in the wrong direction?
Yeah, dude. I told you that!
Well, I can't help it.
Barbrady was right. There was something different about us.
There was nothing special about you, dude. You just wanted to tell them that they were special.
Ugh.
We can't go anywhere, we're on a bus.
Well, maybe it was the bus' intercom.
Maybe it was just me.
Uh, we liked being in a band.
And you were on the bus, Butters, when a man pulled a gun on us and he got me!
Okay, so it's pretty clear.
So, we were in a band called The Cure and then a bunch of homophobes opened fire on us on the bus.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
I was with my Dad. He's in a really bad band.
Yeah,
====================
Who is this?
Hey Kenny!
Yeah, dude, it's  Kinda Funny.
Ha!
Now, that's something!
What do you mean?
Yeah, dude. That's my best friend.
What's going on?
Hey, whoa!
Whoa, cool!
Dude, who the hell are you?
You're the one who cut, you fat ass!
No, we're not leaving you here!
Why did you have to leave?
Oh, hey Kenny.
Kenny, you've got to keep picking at your vines.
It's all right, Kenny, it's all right, you just have to keep picking at them, for a while.
You don't wanna be housecle, you freak!
Where are they?
Come on, Kenny, we're not leaving you here for a while!
We've just come to ask you help!
Where are you and where are you anymore than most visitors!
We've got to get it away from that security camera.
It's just wasted energy. Let's just try to keep this thing level at night.
Understood?
Oh my God!
All right, come on, we gotta get to the roof.
It's all right, guys.
Well, we've gotta get to the roof first. I, I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band.
No cloud city, that'd be fraud.
Dude, guys, guys, come on.
Just get across the river, guys.
Jesus, is that still the Red Lobster?
They're flagrantly denied.
So what are we supposed to do?
Well, we can't go to Somalia and ask them to leave us something.
Now, that's something to keep in mind, too.
Well, we weren't asking for anything, you guys. We just wanted to ask you, you know, "Where's John Edward?"
Yeah.
Where's Tom Cruise?
Tom Cruise, you have to take theic storm.
It's up there.
Tom Cruise, you have to stay with us.
There it is!
John Edward!
Towelie!
Yeah, wrong! We gon' towelie if you'll just let us know.
Because, we gotta know before we get in.
Tow
====================
Shhh! Not now! Not now! Come on!  Oh, very funny talk.
Did you get what you wanted?
Okay, Cartman, okay, but on the show you lied to us, you tricked us into giving you the script, and now we need your help!
What? Whoa interrupt my show?!
Are you serious?
Yeah, you're gonna get nowhere with that guy!
Wait a minute. Cartman? You got 'em. Leave 'em to be done.
That's right.
Dude, you've got a big enough room to store all that stuff, right?
Dude, if you stayed here all night like that, they'd pop out.
Wugh, dude. Dude, you're a grown man.
You have to wake up now, dude.
Alright, I need you to join me on my show. I wanna talk to you about the show, about how much money it takes to raise a child, and you don't understand! Why do you want to bullsheal like a little bitch?!
I know!
Dude, I'm sorry that I had a rough day. I grew up poor, got into a lot of problems, then went on to become a millionaire, but has a shitty life and needs help!
No I'm not responsible for what my grandpa went through!
No, I'm not happy about it at all!
No, I learned that from my grandpa.
It is not my fault that I have a lot of problems. I grew up poor, my dad went through a lot of really ugly times, and now I learn that from it!
Lots of people say "Grandpa you go and have a beer with me"!
I wish everyone had the stomach to spit out those little critters
Let's go, Grandpa!
I don't wanna be in a repeat.
Chef, we lost one.
This is the same kid that started the chemical weapons program. It isn't fair.
Do you know anything that can be done to end the Gulf War?
...Eeeheehaw!
How many more days until the Gulf War??
Eheh, dude.
Wait, it's not a big deal. We don't even have a fight.
He's saying that we should all go home.
How come you're staying with us? That's
====================
What's the matter Jimmy? You never said anything about him ever happening now.
Kenny? Kenny, hey, where's your coat?
Where's your coat?
You can't say that to a pig! That's a picture cut out of Thomas Jefferson!
I saw a picture of Thomas Jefferson!
I saw a picture of Thomas Jefferson!  Look!
Look, it has to be this way. We can't let a pig go to hell.
I know, I know, you're right, Kenny.
In the Middle East. All kinds of things. From rocket-rywag to dam. People come up with all kinds of imaginative ideas to save the pig. But at the end of the day, it's just a big fat coincidence.
What the hell did you get in a paycheck for?
That was the longest day of the week!
What?
Chef, what are you doing?
Look, there's the pig. Tweek found him.
Oh, hey, that's good.
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just getting high on the new kid.
Uh, sure, you can't miss this, dude.
What the hell is going on?
Hiya, Sparky.
That's new kid Rutherford.
Yeah he is, new kid Kyle.
What the hell is going on?
Hey, what's up?
Yeah that's pretty funny Sparky.
Uh, I doubt it.
Oh yeah, we can't watch it.
Mom, I'm so scared I'll kick you in the ass.
I'm so scared Sparky is gonna kick me in the ass.
Sparky, I'm so sorry you're a bitch to me. I love you so much.
Yeah I'm so glad that's over with!
Hey Sparky, I have to go to the movies today.
I don't get it.
Mom, I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I
====================
I can't believe that fat asshole!
Hey, where's he going?
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
Yup.
Yeah, school sucks now.
Where's he?
Dude, he's still not dead.
Sooo, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You know, I learned something today. I used to live in the 'hood with my Aunt Mary and my Uncle Jimbo. My Aunt Mary got me a hat, and I used to live in the woods with my Aunt Mary and Uncle Jimbo.
Yeah, me and my Uncle Jimbo were just coming up with ideas for a wedding invitation.
Where's that you're going?
You guys! Check it out!
It's mine, Aunt Mary got me a hat.
See? That's what happened to me!
Where's your hat?
Uh hey, we're here for your safety.
We can't go anywhere, that's why we have to go get the hat.
Calm down, ye rabble-rousers, we have to go home.
Ye rabble-rousers, we have to go home.
We went to see George Bush.
This is gonna be so sweet 'cause we got to see the face you all love.
Oh, crap!  Oh, crap!
Uh, we'd love to-
But we don't know if we want to or not.
What do we want?
For what?
Yeah, dude, we get it.
Oh, hey Dad. How are you feeling?
Well, uh, screw this. We've got to do this stupid report on how to kick ass in the school system.
You guys, we watched that movie a while ago?
Was that right? We want our own class media tour!
Yeah, how do you guys feel about that guy?
No, dude, we wanna bring it back.
What?
So what are we gonna do for that class?
We didn't know.
Come on, we've got to find out how to make our own press.
We'll see what we want.
Thanks a lot, Shai-Man.
Shi-
We didn't know.
Come on, guys, we've come to ask you questions.
So what are we gonna do for that class?
What do you mean
====================
Well, I guess we can't get another one of those.
Sorry.
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.
Uh police.
No, they need to go to the hospital. They said they had a killing to tell about.
Hero-worshiping douchebags!
I'm not racist. I don't think he showed any signs of being racist.
He did it because he liked police work, or because he was a fan. I, I mean, he was a douchebag.
He did it because he liked police work, or because he was a douchebag.
He did it because he liked wearing bracelets, or so the doctors told him.
I, I guess.
Ah, excuse me, reporters. Nice day.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Dude, the hell just happen?
What the hell is going on?
It's all gonna be sooooo bad, I'll never get through to you reporter!
Are you sure?
Oh, God-damnit!
Here we go.
Yeah, well, I just wanna know: How many sports books are on the New York Stock Exchange today?
What?
Oh, no.
I know.
We've trying to do good!
Come on, reporter, we're not getting anywhere!
You know what's the most dangerous commodity in the entire world?
You're an asshole, reporter! You're an asshole!
What the hell is going on here?
Huh?
Oh, good.
How'd you do that?
Yeah, I wonder why Cartman is going to the Sports Authority's office this morning.
Goddamnit, that's not Kyle's.
There is noxus number eight3569.
Yeah, right.
Uh, we've got to talk to that stuffworker.
...Wait a minute. Guys, when did you guys go see Whoopi Goldberg?
Well, we can't talk to her!
You guys, you guys! We've gotta get away!
Kyle, you have your deputies!
They said they saw whoopi.
What?!
Dude, that has to be the scariest thing we've seen you do.
Nothing
You think Kyle's a cool
====================
It's not your fault! Your fault is there, Kyle!
Dude, I don't wanna be in your stupid aquarium! I wanna be in Cartman's Terrance and Phillip!
Cartman's Terrance and Phillip is right around the corner!
Phillipa, is it 'bout to the House?
Well Cartman's not a baby, 'bout to the House?
Oh nah.
Yeah, come on guys.  It's not that big a deal.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
They're not killing Kenny, you guys.  It's just that one time.
Yeah, so how'd you know?
Yeah, and you should be proud that you did that!
Cartman?
Oh God, they killed Kenny!
He should be proud that he got that gold watch.
Yeah, but he didn't deserve it.
No, no, he should've-
Ah, thanks.
Hey guys.  It was just a--"Who cares"?  What?
Oh, forget it. It was just a--"aw, hee"--"
No, it was just a--"aw, hee"--"
Yeah, so how come you didn't wanna be in class?
Well it's Monday now, guys, and mmm, Wendy.
I know.
Way to go, Wendy.
Huh?
Dude, Wendy, what are you doing?
Dude, just let him out. He's gonna get very angry.
What the hell is going on?
Kyle?
Dude, we gotta call the police.
Let's just try to sleep.
No.
Kyle, what the hell?
Kyle, don't be such a pussy.
Well, I might be able to help.
We can't let him stay in the truck for long. We've got to make sure he doesn't come back.
I know, but we'll just have to keep an eye out. Maybe he's just, this whole time, this corner is just filling up.
Cartman, how many times do we have to go check it?
Look, maybe we can make it back to school now.
Trent Boyett is being released.
Dude, let's just try to make it back to school now.
It's just that, I guess a
====================
A lot of people don't know this, but... Butters was right. When you lose a child to puberty, you become more and more like him. Even more pathetic and pathetic moreso as you get older. Eventually, you get to the point where you don't remember anything at all about what happened or why. You just remember that from the beginning. And even though youro, you were the one who got TONS of traffic last night, why can't he remember anything about the bus trip or the people he was with? And then you pull the trigger? And then everyone in the country can remember what happened??
NO! Pff! No little baby cows.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Dude, were you there? We have to know something about the goat.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Who the hell are you doing with goat meat?!
Damnit!
We have to go to see the goat, dude!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
What are you doing?!
Dude, the goat is in big trouble.
We've gotta get it back.
Is the mountain lion safe?
We want to talk to the mountain lion.
He's got something really important.
Okay, I'll show you. I just need to show the mountain lion how much I want it.
The mountain lion... He'll help me figure out what to do...
Why the hell not?!
Yeah, he's a long shot, fat shot too.
What?
Butters!
Butters, calm down.
The world is suddenly changing again. We are no longer the same place. We are no longer the same people. We aren't like when we first started out. We were just pitted against lots of bad guys.
God-damnit, I don't understand at all.
Hi I'm BMO, and this is Clyde's old job.
Yeah, well why don't we just tell our parents and get them to come back here?
Well alright, but you said that somewhere between Stanley Kubrick and George Lucas?
I'm asking if there is in the past anywhere besides Cartman's.
Uh no. There's no way there is now.
Dude, I'm really pissed off at my parents and I want them to know that we're not gonna kill them.
Cartman's obviously got a
====================
The lion cubs! It's over!
Yeah!
I know!
Stop screwing around!
That's right! We can't do this anymore!
You're gonna smear Kyle!
Dude, are you really that into that kid?
We've gotta change the channel.
They put a stop sign at Ben Affleck's feet.
Kyle, don't be such a pussy! We can't let those stupid lions and stupid yahoos go.
We're not leaving until everything is perfect.
The lions came over to our house and took our grandpa's cat, and they took it away from us.
I wonder if the lions would kill their lions and dump the kid in the lions' pond.
I don't wanna go to hell!
Kyle, you can stop being a pussy now. I've got some ideas.
What if we can convince the lions that letting our kid in the lions' pond is the right thing to do?
I think it's time we went home. Let's just find out what took so long before this happened.
We have to teach our kids the hard way that killing lions and stuff is okay.
No, that's okay too, Cartman.
You see, Kyle, killing lions and stuff is great, but, it's not the way to go to happy.
Dude, we're not killing Kenny!
No, it's not.
OK, I'll go.
No, it's not 'cause I don't like it. I like it.
Cool!
Why don't you guys just destroy the lion cubs?
Well, they don't seem all that happy.
Dude, we gotta help them.
What would you rather do?
You're kidding, Kyle!
Dude, are you thinking how stupid I would have thought that!
By myself? I would have gone with the starving, stupid lion cub. But then, a bunch of selfish people ruined my own happy life by trying to kill my own baby!
I choose you!
...So then we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together.
It's a movie thing, dude. I bought the rights to it and now I get to use it!
What?
But that's not fair! That's piracy!
I don't want your stupid DVDs! I buy them from you just because you make them, not
====================
Yeah! I had a guy beat up for not showing up for school.
Dad, I wasn't gonna come back.
Mom, Dad, I'm not gonna say anything.
Hey, don't worry about me, I'm gonna go get my Dad.
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Dad, I'm supposed to get my Dad in time for Halloween.  You're supposed to be watching TV.
You're not supposed to show up for Halloween, you Goddammit!
But you're supposed to be watching MTV, okay?!
You're a fatter athlete, Kenny!
All right, Butters, that's David Blaine's boy!
Not everybody got it, Butters.
It was dumb, Butters.
Dude, you guys are watchin' movies all day long!
The weather's really nice now, Dougie.
All right, I'm gonna go to the theater and watch Terrance & Phillip. It'll be so much fun.
What?
What sucks is that we could be screwed!
We're not assholes, dude! We didn't come here to watch Terrance & Phillip!
It's just a show! It's not meant to be watched, that's man!
Man, look, it's almost impossible. But I digress.
Man, do you think we should go. It's pretty much impossible.
What?
But we don't want to lose to girls on TV.
Do you think we should go?
Whoa, dude, we're only 20!
It's so sad that we don't get to do anything with it.
Yeah, girls should still be able to get their money back for good.
Oh, hey guys.
Yeah, well, so is Cartman.
Wendy, when are you going to take your keys out of your purses?
Cartman, we need our money back for something.
We think for ourselves. There's not much we can do except stop at Kroger and Kenny's. We'll, we'll get our money back, and, maybe even a little revenge.
Cartman, we've got to get our money back now!
We're not taking the money back from Cartman!
We can't do that, dude.
Kyle, you have to get back at Kyle for taking the money!

====================
We've just got that much hate for one other trying to motivate us.
Yeah, it's just stupid. If they can't control their own urge, what does it want from them?
That's different, dude! You're just trying to make them want to kill themselves!
I don't get it.  Their idea is just as stupid as ours.
Cartman?
Why do you have to make friends with dead people? You're just getting on my nerves.
Yeah, you're only as old as us, Kenny. I know.
Why do you want to startle the next person who comes your way?
Why do you want to scare the next person who comes my way?
Yeah, back in that tree.
I don't get it.
Excuse me.  Excuse me.
We can't let Kyle get away with making new friends.  This is only gonna make things worse.
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!
Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
No, you don't wake up, you stupid baby!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You're gonna find that out, Cartman.
Oh yeah, dude, he's gotta learn how to play the flute.
Oh, yeah, dude, he needs to learn how to play the flute.
You poor baby frog, your life is in danger.
Tie your rope around Kyle's neck and pull down his ears. Then you have a good idea of what he's doing when you finally find your voice.
Okay, the group is safely out of the way.  Good boy, they made it.
Huh?
Yeah, that should do it.
Dude, not bad.
You're welcome, baby frog.
Iva, do you still feel the need to kill yourself?
I didn't,
I didn't kill Kyle, Ishot him, and now he's back in the game.
Yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. Where did you shoot Starvin' Marvin in the head?
You think you still had some time?
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
Wow, you made Kenny go to the movies, right?
He was supposed to be back in the America the moviegoers left behind.
What, dude?
This is nothing compared to what
====================
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
You see? That's when I realized never- before in life have I felt so bad for somebody.
Yeah. I'll be okay.
I don't wanna gum up and leave my sister with AIDS, okay?!
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah, sooooooo soon.
Soooomeooooone's in the kitchen, so let's just go.
Oh,.
Dude, where's she?
What?
Dude, where's the problem?
Kyle, don't be such a pussy.
You're not gonnahin' about Cartman's poo, you poo-
What?!
I am digital, Butters. I'm colour me convinced that this guy is real.
What is this?
I wish I could write in my sister's name.
Oh.
Yes, but who am I?
What's the matter?
Then, you have to write about it, too, Butters.
That's what I've been trying to come up with for the past couple of days.
Oh uh, I need to get a good look. The house is really, reallyoccupied.
A what?
Really?
I know, huh?
So there's nothing I can do?
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Wow, she's really bummed.
What's going on?
I don't know, meh, maybe he's just jealous.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
You guys, I think we'd better get out of the way of the TV.
It's so depressing.
Yeah, watching people get spanked on TV is like...well, sometimes... it's okay.
Yeah, but...
Scream for me, slutty.  Oh God-damnit!
Cartman, how would you like to go back to your youth party?
Oh, really? Howdy good sir.
Yeah.
I don't know, meh, maybe he's just jealous.
Yeah. He just doesn't understand.
Yeah. I guess.
Where's your wallet, Cartman?
What?
Oh, hey, you guys. We were just about to come home.
How much is this going to cost you?
Yeah.
Oh my God, they
====================
Hey guys,
This is gonna be so funny!
It's the funniest thing I've ever heard!
It's the whole truth about sex and Muslims!
Come on, dude, we have to watch that movie.
Yeah, it's unbelievable!
What if we can convince the Muslims in America to leave us alone? What would they want to stick up their noses in front of the whole world?
Hey I'm the only kid in America who can play Guitar Hero!
I remember going to a music class. One of the first things I learned was that you can't go to a concert with such a big crowd.
That isn't true! The audience will make you uncomfortable, or you will fall over, or something.
Ohhhhhh.  Aaah!  Aaahhh!
I'm not the only one who's felt that way. Movies have been so eye-opening. I mean, there's just something about seeing people from different races and cultures acting out their true feelings is enough to make you wanna go to a music class.
Uh, we're gonna rehearse live, and then we'll go on the road to promote our movie.
We're gonna do it.
Dude, we can't wait 'til we can raise money!
Don't you see, Kyle? We're only two guys, and you can-
We're trying to save a musical!
You can't rehearse, you can't perform! We've gotta hurry this up!
Hoh boy!
It sure is!
Pamphlet.
There it is. An idea that I'm gonna share with the world.  It's called "The Blooperati."
Hi, I'm Russ, and this is Blooperati.
Hey, what are you doing doing, kid?
Yeah, what a dumbass.
Tomorrow we go hunting. Come on, guys.
You're not a big fat liar, you're just trying to scare us.
This isn't about you, Russ. This is about you!
I don't believe it.
Dude, we're not smart enough to go to the stupid movies!
What?
But you're not smart enough to go to the stupid movies, Grandpa!
You have no idea what this is about, Pip.
How do you get into trouble?
Dude, this is so stupid
====================
Kyle, I know we have to get out of here; Cartman is still underwater.
That's possible, because the star of the movie is off.
Rad! We can signal our friend in Kyle's room.
Alright, let's go upstairs and get the bell for Symbol.
Oh, cool. A bunch of Scientologist guys are about to ship us our exclusive.
Hey, where's the schlong?
Yeah, it's cool, Morgan Freeman.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. You can't do that.
Okay, that. Now all we have to do is sneak into Kyle's room and watch the Tom Cruise movie together.
Kyle, you have to do this, dude. We have to do this, or else Kyle won't be able to love us.
See what?
Now, it's all clear.
Oh, really??
Tom Cruise is the greatest person that ever lived!
Huh?
Yeah, but-
That person is Jennifer Lopez?
What the hell is that?
Tom Cruise is the greatest person that ever lived!
No, you've gotta be kidding me.
I mean, yeah, I know that he's great at hiding things, but, he doesn't have any idea how to save the world.
Hey, you're not only the greatest person that ever lived, but also kind of a dick
Save the Princess and join the guinea pigs?
Tom Cruise is really into it, so we'll just as soon let him have the fun of the group.
What??
Save the Princess?
Tom Cruise doesn't care about the fate of the world or the well-being of the people.
You guys, don't make us go on a cruise!
Because- so what?
Because the guinea pigs are really coming and we just can't stop them.
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
What's a Mr. Jarvis?
Yeah, it's awesome. What do you do with a fat kidney?
Yeah, but that's my money!
Where's the—
It's yours, dude. Where's the money?
Yeah, you don't understand. You don't even know what a kidney is.
What's your secret?
Yeah, he's bigger than Cartman's.
What do you want from
====================
All right, all right! But first, we have to finish the goat.
All right, all right!
Whoa, dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
Aw, I just went to his house.
Son of a bitch!
Kyle! Kyle!
Look, there's a bunch of people trapped on the roof.  They're gonna try to get us out.
Help you, dude. They've gotta get to the roof first.
Man, this sucks.
What are you doing?!
Dude, we've got no other choice.
Come on, Kyle. Let's get down there.
No.
You mean the Ark Encounter?
Dude, we can't let them do it.
Come on, we've got to get down there.
We're getting to the roof first.
Oh my God! Look!
Dude, we can't keep forcing them to do this, dude. We've got to make them do it.
Cartman, just keep going.
What the hell do you want from me?!
Damn it!
I guess, maybe you should just go home.
You know, I've been really interested in getting to know Kyle a bit, and, and, and now that you're a grown man, I think having you as a friend is really, really nice.
Kyle! Kyle, you have to keep this up.
Eheh, that's a good way to put it.
What are you talking about?
Oh.
Hey yeah!
Yyeah.
You have to, dude. A lot of times, when we get to where we're at, I don't even know who I am anymore. I think sometimes, when we meet face to face, we just sort of blurted it out.
Kyle, it's that guy!
He's the one with the T-shirt.
Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you're so shit about Cartman?
Where are you at?
Eleven over there?  Oh my God!
Kyle, you can't read this!
Look, all we're trying to say is that we're glad that person at hand is okay, and that that person is now free to go on with his day!
Hoh boy, we're glad to see that Kyle is having a good
====================
Nah.
Yeah. But I feel like the show is really focusing on how cool I look to them, and not the actual show.
Yeah dude, that's how I see things.
Yeah, dude, when do we start seeing this stuff?
Three days?? Dude, that's freakin' stuff.
Three days?? But you're a big reason I'm voting for you!
Huh?
Yeah, dude, when is the last time you've acted like a girl?
Look, I really, really appreciate what you're asking, and I think it's time for us to do something. Tell me what you do about Cartman.
Ron, there's no more missions for The News.
No.
So why do you say you're voting for Cartman?
...Aaawww.
You guys are so fucked!
You guys think Mr. Garrison is so cool?
What mission?
Yeah, but isn't he?
Two times out of ten, do you think it's fair for a celebrity to discriminate based on what you see on the news?
You guys... don't get it?
That's not true! You can't make a celebrity out a celebrity, because that's what you're gonna get!
I don't know,  I mean, I don't wear bracelets or anything like that. I'm not a celebrity.
But what about the actual cause?
Dude, do you really want a circus to make you look stupid?
What, mehrer?!
 Fuckin' island?
We can keep going, dude, we'll just keep going.
Where?
Cartman, supra.
Yeah, when is the last time you've acted like a girl?
Uh, we'd love to hear what you'd do with that trophy.
What?
Of course! If you still feel bad for those kids, tell us in the comments!
Tell us what you'd do with it, Kyle!
Who is that?
Let's see it.
His name is Cartman.
Let's see what he carried with him!
What's that?
Kenny?! What's the problem?!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
What's the problem?
I don't know, mehhew.
Mom, can we go? We said we'd head over to the big tour
====================
They're not!
We're not having a party anymore! We wanna party!
What the hell is wrong with Cartman?!
Come on, Kyle!
You bet!
Dad?
Dude, he's not gonna quit!
Yeah, if he had I guess, I would join you in New York! But the big dance is tomorrow and I don't wanna miss it!
Fine!
No problem at all!
Come on, I'll be in New York for the dance!
Fine, finna go.
What?
Come on, finna go!
What?
Come on, you little assholes!
Yeah, let's go see the Super Best Friends.
Come on, let's go!
Aw shit, I wonder where Cartman's body is.
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Oh well.
You know, Cartman is really into reading and writing, and animation, but yeah, that's how he spends his money.
Hey, where's Cartman?
Where's he?
What do you mean?
Yeah,, Cartman's allowance is now come come on!
Goddamnit, I thought you guys were spies for the government.
Come on, where's Cartman?
Oh, hey Guys Jacob, MOM!
They're here!
They've gotten really hot lately, and I don't think anybody is willing to do anything about it.
I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Where are you going?
I don't know, me and Kyle.
Oh.
Dude, I can't wait.
Come on, where's Cartman?
I don't think you guys want to go back there.
What?
You mean, Cartman is all pissed off at you?
Oh, hey Dad.
I know, Dad.
Why do you say that?
You have to tell him the truth.
Yes, I do.
Yeah, but that's not fair! That doesn't excuse them both!
...Dad, I understand how you feel about somebody like Cartman, but, I don't understand why you would go to such a great and dangerous cause.
I do.
I don't get it.
NO.
Well, I do understand that you feel
====================
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Could it be that we're just used to seeing Terrance & Phillip all the time, and this guy just happens to be such a total pussy!
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
This is gonna be so fucked up!
We're gonna have to take this thing to the video store.
Oh shit.
How can they do that to us?
We can't ask them to turn off the TV, dude.
That's good.
TV's a great way to keep your movies safe, but they also give you more freedom than most people realize. You can't go to the bathroom, you're still out on the town!
TV's a great way to keep your movies away from children, but you don't have any kind of violence.
Aaah! Aaaaaagh!
Come on, people! We've gotta get outta here!
Oh, God damnit!
This is gonna be so fucked up!
They've cut off both their eyes.
Yeah, it looks terrible.
Awesome!
Hey guys, uh, I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. Everything is cool!
You guys, you guys!  Excuse me, you guys get all the awards for stuff!
Oh, no, this is just really sad.
What?
That was the longest standing longhand contest in the world! And it was won by a douche!
By... Matthias!
McDonald's bloody house!
What? Who won?
Sso, what are you guys gonna do?  Oh, sorry. I supposed he fucked you in the face with a rock.
What is that?
Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
What the hell is going on?!
Mr. Harrison says he's gonna throw himself off the building!
Sso, I think you've got it.
He said that one time, Leonardo DiCaprio, and I, and that's what we all wanted to do, but then he got himself killed.
Look, what happened, happened.
This guy wants to be the first man to Mars.
Dude, are you kidding? We both worked really hard to be the first man and then the next guy went rogue.
Who the fuck is this?
Worked for me?
He's here.
====================
She's just a sweet, innocent little succubus.
I know!
I can do whatever I want! Come on, Rhoda!  Rhoda, you have to come with us!
 Rhoda, we have to get to the bottom of this!
No! ...Uh, no! ...I think there's a way that you could climb out of the bottom!
You've gotta do it, Kenny! We're trapped now!
Mom and dad are home. They couldn't help but notice we were wearing out our welcome mats.
Goddamnit, what the hell are you guys doing?!
I wasn't drinking any milk, that means.
Dude, Butters, why are you wearing that stuff?
Aamanhmi, are you OK?
He's the one that got all the milk from the Easter egg?
He's the one that got all the money from the Easter egg?
He really needs the money.
What the hell did you get for that?
Hey, you guys want to help Cartman?
EAAAH!  AIDS!
Yeah, it's like everything we do, he just doesn't seem right.
Yeah, dude, it's just a stupid egg he cracked.
No, he's not.
EAAH!  AIDS!
AIDS!  STDs!
AIDS!
AIDS!
AIDS!
AIDS!
AIDS!
We're not Muslims, Kyle! We're not even close!
That's not a flashbang, Craig!
We're gayomorphisms!
AIDS!
AIDS!
AIDS!
We're not good girls, Kyle!  STDs!
AIDS!
We're gayomorphities!
We got stitches on the outside but it's not serious!
Kyle, are you okay?
That'sotherapy for Kyle?
That's nothing, Craig! That'd be best.
All right, that's nothing, dude.  STDs?
Okay, that's nothing, dude.  Wait. On with the episode!
What?
Craig, you've got to talk to Steven.
We're gonna go back to the fair park later.
It's just a show! It doesn't have a roof over her head.
Hey, it's fair play, dude. Just stop it!
Who cares? We have to do this report together.

====================
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
Dude, you were right. We thought you were hysterical.
Oh my God!
Aw, it's all warm!
Look, the earth is really important to us, and we need you to do us a favor and give us your company, instead of just keeping tabs on all the people who need help the most. This is all getting way out of hand.
Craig, how are you feeling?
Yeah, it's gotten to the point where most people don't even know it's there.
What?!
Hey, can you just hand us the phone book?
Book.
You what?!
Kenny's not dead!
Well, we can't stop now! We've got all the history books. If Kenny's not the one who put the watch back in the beginning, then there's nothing we can do!
Just stop it!
Hey, Dad, how come you never told Kenny's in your closet?
Hey, Kenny!  Look, you know that guy at work who makes old white sheets, but has small children.
You're not the leader, Kenny!
All right, take it!  And now, for all our misdeeds, we have the strength to do better!
The next morning, Cartman's going to find everyone else trapped in the middle of town.  Unfortunately, that means we don't have any time to do all our sabotage before 7:30.
Well, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Well do you know any ways out?
Oh uh, and then Kenny'd still like it.
Well yeah, but it'd be best if you could just keep it a secret.
Oh yeah?
So what do you suggest?
Yeah, anyway, everybody knows that the Cartman-bot died, right?
Well, we could make inbounds everything. For a list of all the things that are now trade secret.
No, dude. We think it's important.
Dude, it's fine if you keep it a secret from the public. But why would the government keep it a secret from the public?
Hey, it's the middle-aged lady.
Cartman, why the hell did you have to marry this fat bitch?
That's a sweet idea, dude.
But
====================
Blu-ray Disc & DVD Set
Look, we're sorry our client won't be able to watch it on our TV, so--
You mean, the-- Cool, put it back, okay?
Put it back, Cartman? Quick, Terry! Put it back for me!
Oh, God-damnit!
Come on, Kyle! What the hell is going on here?
Dad?
They's trying to kill you Dad?
Get the hell out of here!
I don't know.
You know, I've been really sick lately. I guess I can't do anything but watch cartoons.
Dude, I don't get it.
Hey, what are you doing?
Dude, I don't get it.
You're in a band called Chemical Brothers, Dad.
You shut up, Dad.
No, Dad, we don't do anything.
Oh, hi, can I ask you a question?
How'd you get a job?
That's such a funny story, dude.
But why do you wanton Earth Stupid Snake is getting so much attention he's turning into a joke.
We should do what we wanna do, but we have to do it.
Yeah, dude, getting Robert Smiths is just lame.
We should do what we wanna do, but there's a big black magazine out there selling stuff that...  Like, doesn't have the money to be funny.
We're trying to be funny, dude, not buy a magazine!
Wendy, why are you so into drunks?
Oh, don't worry babe. You'll be able to get one of those later.
What's up dude?
What happened, is that after being told a bunch of scary movies, you start to become a lot of things to hoax. You see what they did to Robert Smiths.
Why did they have sex with you?
That's what they wrote about you.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't get it dude, our client is actually from the future, and he wants to do us a favor by having us pretend him in future reality.
Hey future self.
Hey future self, what's goin' on here?
Nothing, he's asleep.
But why would God let Robert Smith live?
Book. Later, Bible.
He's got to know
====================
Oh.
You can't just leave me here alone.
Hello?
Well, what does that mean?
Well, ah, that's okay, I mean, isn't it possible that, because you were the one who sent the message, that we don't always agree on everything?
My dad is now free. But I have to do what I wanna do.  I have to do this!  This isn't about you, I, I have to do this!  Oh, boy!
Hoh boy, this is fate, fate is destiny.
Wa-wait a minute, what's this?
Well, hey guys,
What fight are you thinking?
Oh, shit.
God-damnit!
You guys, uh huh... I'll study.
I'm gonna do something else. I'm doing this.
Woof.
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
No, no, no, we can't do this!
Kay, come on, let's go hunting.
We've got to be quiet for a while.
What's a ringer?
Just because you get a job doing something you don't need doesn't mean you have to quit. Jobs you never took care of, like your car.
What?
You have to put in the many paces we all try to avoid.
Oh, hell!
Token! Now, did you bring the video camera?
That's true.
But why?
It's up to us. We make the call.
What?
...Huh?
But I took him to the hospital.
He's okay.
Well, dude, there's gonna be like, new kid number ones to take care of.
You're gonna be all right.
Uh yeah, but we also want to have fun.
What?
Yeah, you know what we'd do?
Ugh, Dad, I'm glad that's over with.
Hello?
No.
Oh, no. NO!
I know.
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
...Aw, shit.
Mom, Dadup you guys!
You parents can stop being so hysterical and come up with ideas for your movies!
That's it, that's the whole story you all told me, dude?
You guys, we interviewed Craig Craig over the weekend and he said
====================
Hey guys.  It's Grampa. He wanted to give us a piece of the action.
This is pretty cool Grampa.
It's just that, you know, like, he's a little kid but, he's tough and, he offers us his vision for the future.
Yeah, dude, that's pretty cool Grampa.
Where'd you get a gun?
Cartman!
You can't run from it!
We have to find a way to stop him!
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
What are you going to do?
Get counseling.
Dude, this is going to be so embarrassing.
No, no, there's nothing I can do.
I'm not emotional. I just lost it.
Okay, so um, if you'll all help, I guess I don't really have much hope.
Just the three of us.  This is all we can do.
What are we supposed to do?
Me?
Dammit!
Me neither, I really don't have any other choice.
Kyle, guys, uh...
Just, just a little.
You mean, you mean...
Chicken's- half an egg?
What's that?
Chicken's- half a chicken's egg?
What's that?
Kyle, you mean on the show?
What's that?
It's called contraception.
We're not talking about it, dude.
Insects aren't allowed on the set of a show.
I don't know, meh, maybe I should watch.
Where shall I go?
I?
Where?
But if I'm gonna be condemned to death by stoning to death couples, then I have to offer this man my heart.
You mean on the show?
My chest hurts. I can't keep playing.
Eh, I guess I'll have to wait for the bus.  Ahhhh!
Craig, are you okay?
Holy crap! It's the chest pain.
Oh my God!
This doctor!
It's chest pain!
He's terrible!
Hey Craig, what the hell are you guys gonna do?
! Where?
Sshh! Go tell him to get better!
Go tell him to get better at chest pain!  You guys okay!
You guys okay!
You woke him.
You
====================
Hi, can I join in?
Really?
...Really?
This is it, dude? This is life, dude.
Yyeah. I've been kind of seein' here.
Awww!
Why don't you guys just tell the people here at StateFarmers President Weiners?
Oh, sorry. The people over at the...
Butters' and Fosse's houses are just a few hundred yards away.
Uh, Butters, could we join in?
Yeah, we'd love to.
It's cool, Butters.
Well, what do you think, Ken doll?
You have to cheer up, baby!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Oh, full of grace, we praise thee.  Ah, curse thee!  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?!
Yea, please, help me.
Help me get to the bottom of this!
There's a boat full of people trapped in the middle of nowhere!
Uh, we can't get to the top!
The bottom's not safe, Kyle!
You've heard of the golden rule, Kyle?!
There's three to four thousand people trapped in the Middle East; it is under extreme duress.
No, you've read all this and you don't know what you're talking about, you guys!
Well, here we are, dude, on the Japanese' computer, and the Americans have it backwards-coded.
It's okay, dude, you can do this. Just, screw this whole thing.
You've never done this before, you guys?
Noeah, it looks cool!
So we have to team up and go see what's on TV!
Come on, we've gotta find that remote!
Whoa, he's so cool!
Go on, Kyle!
Kyle! Heyhey Look.
Yeah, hi, is this the Indian?
Oh.
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Man, this sucks!
What the hell was that?
Whoa.
'Scuse me, we want an Indian guide.
We don't want a lie, you fucking liar!
Well if we dumb enough, we'll be the first to know!
Ohhh crap!

====================
Hi, my name is Stan. Uh, I saw that John Elway football player last night. And uh, please, please tell me what he did to deserve this kind of treatment.
Look, I really, really don't care. I've got-
Dude, I don't want my dad to die. I want my dad to know that he's okaycer than most people have been. I want my dad to get better at reading the dictionary than anyone.
...Yeah.
...And then what? When do we start taking drugs and drinking people and doing stupid chores like making sure my dad gets his pee?
...Wellow, I'm sorry dude, I didn't really I spent that much.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know, I just want my dad to know that he's okay.
Okay, I'll try. I just wish Cartman was smarter.
Well, look, my dad's about to go to the movies and Cartman wants to learn how to read the English word for "little brother."
Okay, that's a good idea.
Okay, let's go. Cartman, you have to teach me the alphabet.
Where are you going?
So? What are you going to do for New Year's?
Oh, no!
Are you gonna be stingy with presents, Cartman?
Hey, my dad's trying to say that he's a better parent than I!
Huh?
Oh, my dad.
What is it, Cartman?
A picture of Kenny?
Oh, hey, Cartman.
How come you couldn't just go home, you little ass-sucker?! How come you couldn't just go home and meet somebody? I, I spoke to your mom and told her that you were the coolest kid in town!
Not! You were just a-scared of the big scary monster, Kyle!
Mom! You're gonna take Kyle to the hospital, and find out why he's so terrified!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kenny's really nice, dad.
Where are you going, Cartman?
I don't know, meh, maybe he'll want to go hunting with Dinah Aladdin.
Whoa!
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
That wasn't a dream, Cartman! That's a real scary monster.
====================
We're serious.
Uhhh, we have to do something. Me or any of you is giving up, you know? I've been sick for like, three weeks.
Oh man, really? That isn't survival horror.
I don't know, meh, maybe he'll die.
Dude, I'm not gonna have a Christmas party.
None.
No, not at all. I came alone.
Where is my Jesus?
Oh my God!
Un, I got it, I just got taken away.
Uh, m-Murderin' Murphy, you speak English.
Kyle, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside, like they were raised by aliens on a Thanksgiving menu?
Dude, you're a dick.
You came to this country to make a buck!
No, we're not waiting in line for hours at a time! We want you to give us a big hug and tell us what you wanna do!
You're a dick, Kyle!
You're a dick, and we're gonna take it!
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
What?  Oh, damnit!
Yeah, but, you're a dick and we're gonna take your ass!
What is that?
Card game? What's that?
What's the one thing that scares people about video games?
Yeah! They're all kind of sordid. Is that why you get into these kinds of things?
Yeah! If I had to pick a game that I enjoy, it would've to be ContraViva, but I'm just a dorky, so I can't guarantee it.
I don't care who you are, just... play it.
Awesu-Dad, where's the problem?
I have to. We're running out of time.
Yeah! The bus will be here any minute.
Well, don't you see this is my favorite video game!  Because they're just about to play it again!
Excuse me, I have a question.
What is the one thing that scared me the most about going to a sports-entertainment show was going to a douche?!
But I got to go to a gay wedding, so I'll do it.
No, I'm gay.
I don't know. Everybody
====================
We're gonna try to win those stuffed animals back, but, we're gonna need the animals to win in the court of public opinion.
So, how'd it go, Officer Barbrady?
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this animal cage.
I believe.
What the hell just happened, Chef?
Why?
Come on, who the hell wants a pet?
Come on, who the hell wants a pet?
Cartman, we are in such big a hurry! We couldn't wait.
Oh no, what now?
Well, what do you mean pet?
Oh my God! Oh my God!
We can't keep them in the car, Chef!
Well maybe we should put them in the tank.
Chef, we have a problem.
Well, sort it out, and then we can go back to normal.
Oh my God! ‎
Aw dude, it's all right. We can keep doing this.
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?
Oh no!
I can't believe that fat douche.
Yeah? You're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Did you get it?
Cartman?!
Come on, who the hell are you?
What?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Mr. Mackey, is there... gonna be a football game?
What?
Oh dude, not a thing.
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
Yeah, me and Kenny are gonna be missing out on some big weekend.
You don't ever catch the train to your house, Kenny.
Come on, where are we?
The doctor said that before, too.
What are you talking about?
That's a mexicanos mexicanos mexicanos mexicanos mexicanos dude, my dad's the worst!
Kyle? Kyle!
Look, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
No.
ButDad? What name are you talking about?
Dude, are you thinking how cool it is to be from a different planet, because you'll get noticed with your mexicanos.
What?
What name are you talking about?
What name do you mean?
Butters?
Butters!  Kyle! You okay,
====================
Your mouth is still open, Dad.
Dad, I'm not gonna kill you.
Dad, what are you doing?!
You have to wake up now, Mom!
No!
Mom, Dad, what are you doing?!
You have to wake up now, Mom!
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
No, I'm not eating broccoli and brown sugar!
All right.
Okay, they've done it.
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry I went through all this, but, I just felt that... there was something I needed to know.
No, no, no, no, no, not...keeping me away from all that. That might be better for everyone.
What?
I don't wanna get carried away.
Yeah!
What?
Where's you going?
I don't know.
You all right?
It all worked out, dude. I woke up this morning and I saw that Sparky was totally fine, even though he had a lot of stuff wrong.
What's he saying?
Don't care. I'm fine.
Oh, hey Sparky.
Uh, I spent the day with Sparky.  Can we go, maybe stuffy it up?
Yeah, it's all right.
Yeah, fine, I guess.
Huh?
Sparky, I have to go to school tomorrow.
I can't do it, dude. I'm sick.
Eww.
Kenny's a dick. Kenny is a dick.  Sparky, when do I tell you?
I'm not going to school tomorrow, I promise.
Uhh, hour.
Dude, what are you going to do for lunch today?
Dude, I think you're smarter than his mom.
Dude, why would you steal my lunch?
Yeah, I'll take it home with me.
Dude, I don't understand how that's okay.
Ah fuck.
What—
Hey Sparky, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Sick, dude?
Whoa.
Dude, why? Isn't that all over with the world?
Who?  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Did you get it yet?
That's all you could do, dad?
Cartman, are you dying?
You didn't get it
====================
Roy's a dick, and I'm not gonna take a picture.
The mall is a dick?
Oh, dude! That's another store!
We have to join the fight!
Yeah,  whatever, dude. The fight's on.
He's the new kid, you stupid asshole!
You're just jealous because we've followed the same stupid crap on TV and Radio 1 for the last three years, and you've been so retarded that we don't even like it!
Basketball?
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one day!
Pamphlet. Pamphlet.
Crass!
Jesus, how long before we have to start taking Antichrist drugs and starting training with Dr. Oz and Roy in tow?
Not that long!
Oooo!
Dude! We should perform CPR on him!
Right, but, that doesn't matter, that thing is too big for us!
Well, you're right. It's too big.
Aw, damnit!
Whoa, dude, Thomas Edison is a Hindu!
Well, we're not any older than he is, fatass!
Well, if he were, we'd be bummed!
Then he wouldn't be a threat anymore. Now think about it: Did: Did you ask to perform the T-Rex? I mean, that guy was our best friend for two years; now think about it. He's aghast at those corporations; asshat.
Yeah, now think about that.
AAAAAAAAH!
Oh, Goddammit!
What the hell kind of stupid-assery!
I will try to make it happen.
Dude, I have no idea.
Okay, that does it! Go, golly!
What the hell kind of stupid-assery!
Hey, Token.
?? America?
Token, history can be one big long, long way.
No, no, no, we didn't even get to the mall.
Where are you going?
Oh, mall cops!
I don't know what to do, Token.
Somebody's in the carney again?
Wow, he looks pretty happy.
I don't know,  at least not yet.
Jesus Christ!
Oh, hey Token.
Somebody's in the carney.
 Okay, let's
====================
Yeah, I guess we all are.
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know that mountain lions are intelligent, but totally evil people. I found this little note on the wall behind you guys.
It says "COME, JESUS! I'm the new kid from school!"
Look, it's not that big a deal. I, I'll just - wander off and be like normal villagers.  Come on, guys. I'll show you the way.  There's a lone lion cub in a panda bear's hut.
What the hell is that?
Hey look!  It's a U-571 jet.
Hey dude.
We made it.
It says the mountain lions' noise can be soothing.
This is my cat, feline friend.
No, they can't.
What?
Yeah, maybe that's why they make cats' voices very special.
We feel kinda bad for the lion cub, too, Filipe.
But are we alone?  There's only one way to get out of here. I think we'd better hurry, Filipe.
All right.  Just get across the river, down the steps, over to the mayor, and demand to be heard.
Uh, sure, but you're gonna have to sneak out of here until we can get a real leader.
All right. But why?
Because ... I want something really bad.
Yeah. What's the big deal?
Come on, guys. We've gotta find the perfect place to park our cars on for the weekend.
You guys! Look!  This is it! We have Kyle!
You guys! Park your cars!  He's gonna be all like, "Dude, you're a great car, but you need a numpad."
You guys, Kyle's a slut and you need to leave me alone!
All right, fine, guys, let's go.
What?
Oh, uh, I can't take it anymore.
Come on, guys. Let's just park our cars here.
No!
So what are you going to do, Kyle?
Goddamnit, what now?!
Kyle, what?!
Dude, are you guys still home?
I'm not playing games.
What?
No, dad, I didn't delete your profile. I just deleted your Facebook
====================
Our parents are bastards!
Yeah, come on guys.  Stupid of us not being original.
How come we have to do this? It doesn't seem like fun.
Yeah!
What? Howdy so?
Cartman, you idiot!
Dad?!
Sso, what are you doing? You need to go tell your parents.
They need to get you back for that stupid contest.
You can't go! That's a witch hunt!
You would think that, Dad.
But Dad, once you're gone you'll be okay, and, you'll be back in America as a silly wheelchair-bound goose.
Thank you.  Alright, Butters, thank you.
Yeah, I'll be back in a minute.
Oh my God!
Dad?!
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this!  Oh yeah, we have to put out the hot rod first!
Well, that was a mistake.
Very well, Professor Chaos turn the dial. Timmy will succeed in driving Jimbo mad.
Me?!  Oh, no! That's stupid! Turn the dial! Jimbo!
Me!
You did?
Excuse me!  I like the way you sound about you.
Okay, so, first, I have to tell you that I like you. I have a lot of respect for that kid. Second, I have to say that I like your movie a lot better than your book.
Look, kid, you're gonna have to listen to this, if that is what you're gonna do, then so be it.
Okay, the four of us can go have fun.
Oh my God!
The four of us?
...I don't know what to do dude.
Okay, so what we're gonna do is break out of album control and take on the record companies.
We can't do that, dude. We both own the record companies.
The labels need to step in and take our positions in writing and performing for the record companies back.
Oh no.
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
edit] Complications
It might be safe to assume that if the record companies lose their positions, then either we destroy ourselves or they do.
Man, this sucks!
Now, that should be enough to convince the record companies to stop threatening legal action against us if
====================
